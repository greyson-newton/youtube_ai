__label__2 It Doesn’t Exclude Women to Acknowledge Everyone Who Can Get PregnantOPINIONTo say that abortion bans, like those recently passed in Texas, are part of a war on women is true. But to say they are a war on women alone is to erase the harm experienced by the transgender, intersex, nonbinary and gender expansive individuals whose lives are also deeply impacted by access to abortion and reproductive healthcare. Even though US District Judge Robert Pitman noted in his short-lived stay of the Texas ban, “The court recognizes that not all pregnant people identify as women,” very few major media outlets have made any change in how...
__label__5 If Kavanaugh And Barrett Betray Pro-Lifers, We Must Blow Up The Conservative Legal MovementOPINIONIf we don't have justices who are comfortable overturning outrageously unconstitutional abortion rulings, it will be proof of the conservative legal movement's utter failure. Less than a handful of years after their hard-won elevation to the Supreme Court, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are sending a chill down the spines of conservatives with a string of bad signals from their seats on the court. In July, Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the court’s leftist majority in declining to hear Arlene’s Flowers v. Washington, a critical religious liberty case. They again sided with...
__label__3 ‘I had to stand up and say no’: Pro-choice Christians battle Texas lawAbortion is a complicated issue in many faith communities. One effect of Texas’ strict new abortion law, SB8, has been to spur people to wrestle more deeply with the topic – and to clarify their feelings around it. Growing up in a “super conservative” family in Tennessee didn’t lead the Rev. Gayle Evers to become a conservative pastor. Now based in Austin, Texas, she is co-pastor of Journey Imperfect Faith Community, and a chaplain for a group that ministers to LGBTQ people of faith and their families. She has been...
__label__2 ‘Catastrophic implications’: UN health expert condemns US over threat to abortion rightsThe United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health has called on the US supreme court to uphold the right to abortion in America or risk undermining international human rights law and threatening that right elsewhere in the world. The special rapporteur, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, is one of just a handful of global observers whose mandate is to travel the world defending human rights. Mofokeng has argued in a brief filed in a US court that overturning abortion rights would violate international human rights treaties ratified by the US, including the convention against torture,...
__label__5 Biden’s Visit to the VaticanOPINIONIn the days of John F. Kennedy, the Democrats emphasized their political distance from the pope. Kennedy promised Americans that he would never let the pope influence him on “matters of public policy.” How times have changed. Today’s Democrats boast of their political alliance with Pope Francis. They openly confer with him on matters of public policy, as evident in Joe Biden’s latest visit to the Vatican. After he met with the pope last Friday, Biden praised him for “fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic...
__label__3 In Texas abortion cases, hints of new Supreme Court transparencyAs it hears two key cases and wades deeper into what’s poised to be a scrutinized term, the U.S. high court appears also to be more responsive to a public call for greater transparency. In a marathon three hours of oral arguments today, the United States Supreme Court continued its rapid handling of a controversial Texas law that effectively outlaws abortion in the state. The constitutional right to abortion is not at issue, but two cases brought in front of the court at breakneck speed still raise significant questions about...
__label__2 NAACP urges pro athletes not to sign with teams in Texas over abortion and voting lawsThe NAACP is calling on professional athletes to reconsider signing with professional sports teams in Texas to protest the state's controversial voting and abortion laws.  In an open letter to the unions for the NBA, NFL, WNBA, MLB, and NHL, the NAACP urged athletes to consider the use of their platforms and positions as role models for kids across the country.  "Over the past few months, legislators in Texas have passed archaic policies, disguised as laws, that directly violate privacy rights and a woman's freedom to choose, restrict access to free and...
__label__4 Antifa crashes Texas college's pro-life prayer vigil: 'F*ck your God!'On Monday night in Denton, Texas, a pro-life vigil was underway when it was crashed by hundreds of Antifa protestors, who attempted to drown the event out. In the video, the pro-life activists who gathered for the event were chanting "Christ is King," to which the Antifa counter protestors started shouting "F*ck your God." The pro-life prayer vigil was led on campus Monday by the local Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) chapter at the University of North Texas (UNT). According to Fox News, Kelly Neidert, founder of the YCT chapter at UNT,...
__label__3 U.S. Supreme Court hears challenges to Texas near-total abortion banThe U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Monday in challenges by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it - a novel design that has shielded it from being blocked by lower courts. Abortion rights in the United States are hanging in the balance as the nine justices take up the dispute over the Texas law barring abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy before hearing arguments on Dec. 1 over the...
__label__1 The Supreme Court Won’t Halt Texas’s Abortion Ban While The Justices Decide If Anyone Can SueThe US Supreme Court will allow Texas’s six-week abortion ban to remain in effect for now, with a majority of the justices rejecting the Justice Department’s push to immediately pause enforcement of the law while constitutional challenges work through the lower courts. The order, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from, leaves intact a decision earlier this month by a federal appeals court that revived the law, SB 8, two days after a judge in Austin blocked it. It means that healthcare providers in Texas will remain barred from performing nearly all...
__label__4 Is the pro-life movement prepared to win?OPINIONAfter being given a huge nudge from the Supreme Court declining to block Texas’ new restrictions on abortion, the main topic of conversation in the pro-life movement today is the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned or weakened. When the court rules on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in the coming months, many in the movement are hopeful for a big legal win. But is the pro-life movement prepared to win? An important lesson Americans must learn from our history is that legal victories without accompanying...
__label__3 Biden, Pope Francis Meet Amid Controversy Over AbortionPresident Biden, the second Catholic president in American history, traveled to the Vatican on Friday for a meeting with Pope Francis that is expected to focus on climate change but has been overshadowed by controversy among church leaders over the president’s support for abortion rights. Some U.S. bishops say that Catholic politicians who support legal access to abortion should be barred from Communion. In a little more than two weeks, at their annual fall meeting in Baltimore, U.S. bishops are expected to debate whether to make a collective statement to that effect. But...
__label__1 Ending Roe Could Send More Women to Prison for MiscarryingOPINIONThe number of women in prison has skyrocketed over the last 40 years. Despite critical state level criminal justice reforms designed to keep people out of prison, both sexes have not benefited equally. Women currently go to prison at twice the rate of men. And now, a new threat to the over-prosecution and incarceration of women looms large in the, perhaps, unexpected forum of reproductive rights. This year alone, state legislators have introduced nearly 600 abortion restrictions, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood. Some of these laws,...
__label__5 Biden Says He Would Sign Reconciliation Bill With or Without Hyde AmendmentPresident Biden said Tuesday that he will sign off on Democrats’ massive social-spending package regardless of whether it includes the Hyde amendment, a stipulation that prohibits taxpayer money from funding abortions.A reporter asked the president if he is “okay” if the Hyde Amendment is in the reconciliation bill, to which Biden responded, “I want to get the bill passed.”
__label__3 'We have to be heard': Texas women travel to seek abortionsThe 33-year-old Texas woman drove alone four hours through the night to get to the Louisiana abortion clinic for a consultation. She initially planned to sleep in her car, but an advocacy group helped arrange a hotel room. Single and with three children ranging from 5 to 13, she worried that adding a baby now would take time, food, money and space away from her three children. She doesn’t have a job, and without help from groups offering a safe abortion, she said, she probably would have sought another way...
__label__1 Texas’s anti-abortion law is back at SCOTUS. Here’s what’s different this time around.OPINIONOn October 14, the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit formally blocked a trial court’s decision halting SB 8, a Texas law banning most abortions in that state. On Monday, the US Justice Department, which sued to halt the Texas law, sought review of the Fifth Circuit’s thinly reasoned, single-paragraph order in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, where Republican appointees hold a 6-3 supermajority, is unlikely to do anything to restore abortion rights in Texas. Last month, a 5-4 Court handed down its own thinly reasoned, single-paragraph order permitting the Texas law to take effect....
__label__4 Marjorie Taylor Greene gets in shouting match with Dem lawmakers on Capitol stepsRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Friday sparked a shouting match with a pair of Democratic lawmakers outside the Capitol, prompting one of them to scream that the far-right politician should practice the biblical principle of loving one’s neighbor, videos show.After the House passed a bill codifying the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights case — a move made in response to the Supreme Court ruling on Texas’ anti-abortion law — the outspoken Republican heckled Democrats holding a celebratory press conference on their legislative victory.
__label__3 Texas abortion law foes target lawmakers’ corporate donorsFoes of Texas’ strict abortion ban are taking aim at companies that donated money to the bill’s sponsors, hoping consumers will pressure corporate America to join the fight against a surge of restrictions. The television and digital ads begun this past week by the groups Corporate Accountability Action and American Bridge 21st Century, the Democratic Party’s opposition research arm, highlight AT&T’s contributions to Texas Republican lawmakers. There are plans to expand the campaign to Florida, where a similar abortion proposal has been introduced. Abortion rights supporters in Texas are confronting the nation’s strictest...
__label__1 Texas’s Six-Week Abortion Ban Is Back On After An Appeals Court Paused A Judge’s InjunctionTexas's six-week abortion ban is at least temporarily back in effect as of Friday night after a federal appeals court paused a lower court order from earlier this week that had halted enforcement of the law. The order from a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, granting what’s known as an “administrative stay,” isn’t permanent — the court will now decide whether to grant Texas’s request for a longer-term hold that would keep the law, SB 8, in effect while the state appeals its...
__label__5 New York Governor Asks Facebook to Censor Pro-Life ‘Misinformation’ About AbortionNew York’s brand new governor wants Facebook to censor pro-life “misinformation” about abortion. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, sent a letter Monday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting that the social media giant increase efforts to censor pro-life “misinformation” in light of Texas’ new law banning abortions after babies’ heartbeats can be detected. Hochul, who took office in late August after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned over numerous #MeToo allegations, expressed concern that viral Facebook posts about the Texas Heartbeat Act will make women who seek abortions feel...
__label__3 Abortion, religion, gun rights on agenda as Supreme Court starts new termThe Supreme Court begins a new nine-month term on Monday, with major cases on abortion, religion and gun rights on the docket. Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...
__label__2 Back on the Bench, the Supreme Court Faces a Blockbuster TermA transformed Supreme Court returns to the bench on Monday to start a momentous term in which it will consider eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, vastly expanding gun rights and further chipping away at the wall separating church and state. The abortion case, a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks, has attracted the most attention. The court, now dominated by six Republican appointees, seems poised to use it to undermine and perhaps overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to...
__label__4 DOJ seeks emergency block of Texas abortion lawThe Biden Justice Department wants a federal judge to temporarily block Texas’ abortion law, arguing it is a “severe intrusion” on women’s constitutional rights. The Department of Justice on Tuesday night filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for Western Texas. In the 49-page complaint, the DOJ said Texas’ ban on abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which typically occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy, unlawfully curtails women’s reproductive rights. The law bans most pre-viability abortions, including in instances of rape or incest,...
__label__3 The one case that could define the Supreme Court’s term – and legacyIs the law really the law, if change in personnel results in dramatic change? That’s the question Americans are grappling with as a momentous Supreme Court term opens this week. Justice Clarence Thomas, now the most senior member of the United States Supreme Court, admits he’s never been one to regularly hype the court.  “I’m quite content not to get out on the road,” he said last month, recalling a conversation years ago when his late colleague Justice Antonin Scalia encouraged him to get out “and fly the flag.” It...
__label__1 Abortion Has Never Been Just About AbortionOPINIONAs recently as 1984, abortion was not a deeply partisan issue. “The difference in support for the pro-choice position was a mere six percentage points,” Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, told me by email. “40 percent of Democratic identifiers were pro-life, while 39 percent were pro-choice. Among Republican identifiers, 33 percent were pro-choice, 45 percent were pro-life and 22 percent were in the middle.” By 2020, Abramowitz continued, 73 percent of Democratic identifiers took the pro-choice position, while only 17 percent took the pro-life position, with 10 percent...
__label__5 Harris Holds Double Standard On Abortions And VaccinationsKamala Harris delivered remarks on personal rights on abortions during a women’s reproductive rights roundtable, but failed to link the point to the issue of vaccinations. According to Harris, abortion was a right protected by the Constitution. Harris went on to say, “you have been leading on an issue that represents the voices of so many who deserve to be heard, deserve to be seen, and whose rights must be protected, and in particular, their constitutional rights and the right to dignity in making their own choices about their personal...
__label__3 ’A Fetus at 6 Weeks Has No More Brain Than a Grain of Rice’FACT CHECKA viral Facebook post claims that “A fetus at 6 weeks has no more brain than a grain of rice.” The post references the Texas heartbeat abortion law, which prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually at six weeks. The first claim in the post—that a baby during the sixth week of gestation is the size of a grain of rice—is accurate. Gestational calendars use the beginning of a woman’s last cycle as a start date, but conception usually occurs two weeks later, meaning that at this point, the embryo has...
__label__1 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Has Issues With Incentivizing Abortion LawsuitsFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Senate President Walton Simpson are backing away from a key component of the Texas abortion ban after Florida state lawmakers announced that they would consider passing a similar bill. Florida Republicans plan to take up their own anti-abortion legislation early next year, but DeSantis has expressed some hesitation about details of the Texas bill, which provides financial incentives to private citizens who file suit against anyone assisting someone with an abortion. As it stands, private citizens in Texas can sue anyone involved in terminating a pregnancy...
__label__5 'I know you've never faced those choices - you've never been pregnant': Psaki snaps at Catholic TV's male reporter who asked why Biden 'supports abortion when his Catholic faith teaches it's wrong?'White House press secretary Jen Psaki snapped at a male Catholic TV reporter questioning how President Biden squares his abortion views with his faith, telling him: 'I know you've never been pregnant.' 'Why does the President support abortion when his own catholic faith teaches it is morally wrong?' Owen Jensen, reporter for Catholic television network EWTN, asked the press secretary on Thursday afternoon. 'He believes it's a woman's right, it's a woman's body and it's her choice. It's up to a woman to make those decisions and a woman's decision to make with...
__label__3 Tripwire boss steps down over support for Texas abortion lawThe president of game-studio Tripwire Interactive has stepped down after tweeting support for a controversial new abortion law in Texas. The Texas law bans abortions from as early as six weeks into pregnancy. John Gibson tweeted he was "proud" of the legal outcome and was a "a pro-life game developer". Some of the studio's partners rapidly distanced themselves from Mr Gibson, with one announcing it would cancel its contracts over the issue. And two days after the tweet was posted, amid an avalanche of criticism, Tripwire said: "Effective immediately, John Gibson...
__label__2 Mexico’s Supreme Court Votes to Decriminalize AbortionMexico’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that making abortion a crime was unconstitutional, setting a precedent for the legalization of abortion nationwide in a conservative Catholic country of about 120 million people. The unanimous ruling from the nation’s top court follows a growing women’s movement in Mexico that has repeatedly taken to the streets of major cities across the country, demanding greater rights and protections for women. “Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,” said Supreme Court Chief Justice Arturo Zaldivar after the decision was...
__label__5 Supreme Court votes 5-4 to leave Texas abortion law in placeA deeply divided Supreme Court is allowing a Texas law that bans most abortions to remain in force, for now stripping most women of the right to an abortion in the nation’s second-largest state. The court voted 5-4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers and others that sought to block enforcement of the law that went into effect Wednesday. But the justices also suggested that their order likely isn't the last word on whether the law can stand because other challenges to it can still be brought. The Texas law, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in...
__label__3 U.S. Justice Dept. says will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attackThe U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law that imposed a near-total ban on abortion. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or "aids or abets" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a...
__label__2 'Just the beginning': After Texas victory, anti-abortion rights activists could extend gainsANALYSISThe ripple effect after Texas’ highly restrictive anti-abortion law went into effect was immediate. Within 24 hours, legislators in at least six states — Florida, Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota — expressed interest in introducing similar legislation. With state legislatures out of session, most of the bills won’t be introduced right away. But abortion rights advocates say the threat to women’s reproductive freedom across the United States has already begun — and extends far beyond abortion. “It’s important to realize that the attacks on abortion are not the endgame for the anti-choice movement,” said Kristin Ford,...
__label__5 House Democrats repeal amendment banning taxpayer funding for abortions overseasHouse Democrats on Wednesday voted to repeal a ban on U.S. taxpayer funding for elective abortions in foreign countries. The House voted 217-212 on a State Department and foreign assistance spending bill that, for the first time in more than half a century, did not include a provision know as the Helms Amendment, which blocks fundings for abortions. The bill, which no Republican supported, also repealed the Mexico City policy, a provision that blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortions overseas. All but three Democrats voted in favor of...
__label__3 Lyft And Uber Offer To Pay Legal Fees For Drivers Sued Under Texas Abortion LawRideshare companies Lyft and Uber both separately announced they will cover legal fees for any drivers who are sued under Texas’ new abortion law for transporting women to abortion clinics, following a wave of other companies that have declared they would provide aid to women seeking abortions in the state. Under Texas’ new abortion law, anyone who helps an individual with an abortion, including driving them to a clinic, can be sued and fined over $10,000, which raised concerns for some rideshare drivers, according to NPR. Lyft said it has created a “Driver Defense Fund” to cover 100%...
__label__2 TikTok Users and Coders Flood Texas Abortion Site With Fake TipsAfter a Texas law restricting abortion went into effect on Wednesday, the state’s largest anti-abortion group publicized a website that invited citizens to inform on the law’s violators. The website, prolifewhistleblower.com, which was set up by the group Texas Right to Life, was designed to help carry out the new law. That’s because the law places enforcement not in the hands of state officials but with private citizens, who are deputized to sue anyone who performs or aids an abortion in violation of the law. Tips about the law’s potential offenders quickly...
__label__4 America’s Class War Over AbortionOPINIONOn Thursday, the state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade. “Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong,” the state said in a brief submitted to the Court. “The conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition.” Mississippi was laying out its arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case that presents the best opportunity since Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) to unravel America’s abortion regime. Mississippi attorney general Lynn Fitch could have stopped short of asking for the reversal of Roe. But she...
__label__3 Abortion ruling and the Supreme Court’s shadow docketA major abortion decision with no oral arguments, lower court rulings, or even a justice’s signature: That’s what happened Wednesday night. In a break with tradition, the Supreme Court is regularly using its shadow docket for cases with potentially far-reaching implications. It sounds dramatic. It sounds nefarious. But the United States Supreme Court’s “shadow docket” is not new. What is new, however, is how the court has been using it. In the space of 10 days, the justices have put the shadow docket – every decision the court makes not...
__label__2 Democrats rush to find strategy to counter Texas abortion lawJoe Biden and top Democrats are scrambling for a strategy to counter Republican restrictions on women’s reproductive rights amid the fallout from a Texas statute that has banned abortions in the state from as early as six weeks into pregnancy – but the options available to the administration are thin. The conservative-dominated supreme court in a night-time ruling refused an emergency request to block the Texas law from taking effect, in a decision that amounted to a crushing defeat for reproductive rights and threatened major ramifications in other states nationwide. Even as...
__label__5 Planned Parenthood Spent $271 Million in Federal Funds Between 2016 and 2018, Audit FindsThirty-nine Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates together spent $271 million in federal grants from fiscal years 2016 to 2018, not counting Medicaid reimbursements, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress.The amount of money, which is sometimes allocated years in advance, was not substantially affected by the transition from Democratic President Barack Obama to Republican President Donald Trump in January 2017. The totals were $88 million in 2016, $93 million in 2017, and $89 million in 2018.
__label__3 The Supreme Court Heads Toward Reversing Abortion RightsThe Supreme Court's conservative majority tossed a legal bomb into the abortion debate late Wednesday night. By a vote of 5-to-4, the court's most conservative members upheld, for now, a Texas law that, in effect, bans abortions after about six weeks. But almost as important as the result was how the court reached its decision — without full briefing and arguments before any court. The court majority, including its three Trump appointees, emphasized that it was not ruling on the issues presented in the case. Still, it refused to block the law...
__label__1 The Texas Abortion Ban Is Just the BeginningANALYSISOn Monday and Tuesday, the rain in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was relentless. But on Wednesday morning, Hurricane Ida retreated for a little while, the sun reappeared with a vengeance, and the humidity stubbornly hung over the Southeast. At the West Alabama Women’s Center, it was business as usual, except for one thing: The protesters who usually clustered behind a series of white poles bordering the clinic’s parking lot had not reappeared. It felt like an ominous sign on a morning when the right to abortion access was once again being decimated....
__label__4 Mississippi Asks US Supreme Court to Overturn Abortion Rights Landmark Roe v. WadeThe state of Mississippi on Thursday urged the U.S. Supreme Court in a major case set to be argued in its next term to overturn the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized that women have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, said in papers filed with the court that the Roe v. Wade ruling and a subsequent 1992 decision that affirmed it were both "egregiously wrong" and that state legislatures should have more leeway to restrict abortion. The court has a 6-3 conservative...
__label__3 Supreme Court Upholds New Texas Abortion Law, For NowThe U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday night refused to block a Texas law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The vote was 5-to-4, with three Trump-appointed justices joining two other conservative justices. Dissenting were conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, and the court's three liberal justices. The decision left open the option for abortion providers to challenge the Texas law in other ways in the future, leaving open the possibility--even likelihood-- that the case will return to the Supreme Court, though not for months or longer. The opinion was unsigned. It said...
__label__2 Supreme Court declines to block Texas abortion lawA sharply and bitterly divided U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block a novel Texas law that opponents say could effectively outlaw abortion in the state. In an order and opinions issued just before midnight Wednesday, the justices revealed that they split 5-4 in refusing the request from abortion rights advocates to put the Texas law — which went into force early Wednesday — on hold while litigation over the measure proceeds. The court's majority said in an unsigned order that procedural issues related to the unusual private enforcement mechanism the law...

__label__1 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...
__label__4 ‘Defund the police’ unpopular in Senate, spending to hire cops wins huge bipartisan supportSen. Josh Hawley’s proposal to hire 100,000 police officers across the country has received rare bipartisan support in the Senate. The Missouri Republican’s amendment passed by a 95-3 vote Wednesday, signaling a willingness from both parties to expand policing. The measure would send grants to local municipalities to hire more law enforcement officers as the country faces a rise in violent crime and a rash of officers quitting the force. “As you have recognized, putting 100,000 more officers on the beat is vitally important for public safety,” Mr. Hawley wrote...
__label__3 The easiest cure for political distrustOPINIONNine months into the Biden presidency and a new but divided Congress, the political debate in the United States may be going far beyond policy issues, such as money for what has long been a bipartisan favorite, transportation infrastructure. In a new survey, more than half of both Biden and Trump voters view elected officials from the opposing party as “presenting a clear and present danger to American democracy.” More than 40% on each side say the same about anyone who strongly supports the opposing party. These are merely perceptions,...
__label__2 Texas abortion providers ask supreme court to halt unprecedented abortion lawTexas abortion providers are asking the US supreme court to block a near-total abortion ban that allows any individual the right to sue an abortion provider who violates the extreme law, a final effort to stop the unprecedented measure from taking effect on Wednesday. Signed into law by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in May, Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically around six weeks – and offers no exceptions for rape or incest. The appeal to the nation’s high court comes after the largely conservative fifth circuit...
__label__4 How To Be An Anti-ExtremistOPINIONOne either allows wrongthink to persevere, as an extremist, or confronts wrongthink, as an anti-extremist. There is no in-between safe space of “not extremist.” The claim of “not extremist” neutrality is a mask for extremism. That’s a very slight paraphrase of a line from Ibram X. Kendi’s How to be an Antiracist. In Kendi’s telling—his version is about racists and antiracists and racial inequities—it’s the air-tight justification for an “anti-racist constitutional amendment” and a consequent “Department of Antiracism” (I wonder who should be in charge of that?). It is also the...

The city’s bipartisan approach hinges on a cooperative ethos that mitigates both fire risk and ideological divides. A municipal water tank built into the forested hills above Ashland offers postcard views of the mountain valley town on clear days. This warm September morning is not, alas, such a day.

__label__1 Roe v. Wade Is Now in the Hands of the Three Trump JusticesANALYSISOne of the most interesting fissures that has opened up within the conservative legal movement in recent years has been between mainstream conservative lawyers and the growing performance artist faction of the lawyers for the Trump base. Soon, the conservative justices themselves will have to pick which side of the battle they are on: With the filing last week of a brief that explicitly asks the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the state of Mississippi is forcing the court’s three newest Trump-appointed justices to choose between institutional stability and...
__label__4 Olympics Remind Us That Sports Build Bridges Where Governments Can'tANALYSISThe United States and Iran met today at the Tokyo Olympics to play basketball. The elephant in the room—decades of geopolitical saber-rattling and proxy violence—was nowhere to be seen. The Americans clapped as the Iranian national anthem played. The Iranians applauded "The Star-Spangled Banner." Handshakes and niceties were exchanged before and after the game. It was a match between opponents, not enemies. Historical relations between the U.S. and Iran might make that goodwill seem staggering—but today's game perfectly highlights the difference in how governments interact and how normal people do. The story...

A Pew Research Center analysis finds that the UN is seen in a positive light by most in the 17 publics surveyed this year: A median of 67% express a favorable opinion of the UN, compared with a median of 29% who have an unfavorable opinion.

"Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking, and it should be," Biden said Oct. 4.  Biden pointed the finger at Republicans, saying that they incurred debt during the Trump administration, and the Democrats helped them out at the time. "Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times when Donald Trump was...
__label__4 Romney, bipartisan infrastructure group reach agreement on $1 trillion bill. What will it do?After months of negotiation, a group of 10 senators reached agreement on a bipartisan infrastructure package, and it passed a procedural vote to move forward discussions in the Senate Wednesday night. The proposed framework would be the largest investment in American infrastructure in nearly a century. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, one of the 10 lawmakers involved in the bipartisan negotiations, praised the bill as “good legislation with good policy,” noting that the bill is evidence that Congress can find compromise on meaningful legislation. “I think it’s also important for...
__label__3 Padilla, Paul introduce bipartisan bill to protect 200,000 "Documented Dreamers"Sens. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday introduced a bill that seeks to provide a pathway to citizenship for the country's 200,000 "Documented Dreamers." Why it matters: Documented Dreamers are children of long-term visa holders who often wait years for a green card and face deportation if they don't receive legal immigration status after turning 21, when they lose dependent status. They come to the U.S. as dependents of long-term nonimmigrant visa holders, including H-1B, L-1, E-1 and E2 workers. Backlogs mean they often have to wait for...
__label__2 There’s a Bipartisan Voting Rights Bill. Yes, Really.A bipartisan elections bill is the rarest of creatures, one many Americans have never seen in the wild. Congressional Democrats are united behind sweeping voting rights legislation that won’t pass the Senate so long as the filibuster exists, because Republicans are united against it. Republican legislators in Texas, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere have passed numerous voting restrictions over united Democratic opposition. But on one sliver of voting issues, it seems lawmakers might — might! — be able to agree. The Native American Voting Rights Act, or NAVRA, was introduced in the House last month...
__label__4 Don Lemon blasts man who harassed Tucker Carlson in viral videoCNN anchor Don Lemon ripped the man who accosted Tucker Carlson in a Montana fly fishing shop, saying he had no right to invade the Fox News host’s “personal space.” The liberal Lemon offered his surprising take during his CNN program “Don Lemon Tonight” Monday evening, when he devoted an entire segment to addressing the weekend encounter, which he said put him in a position “to maybe somehow have to defend Tucker Carlson.” “Let me tell you this: I don’t like it. I don’t like it when people do that...
__label__3 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__2 Americans Stretch Across Political Divides to Welcome Afghan RefugeesPHOENIX — The hundreds of parishioners at Desert Springs Bible Church, a sprawling megachurch in the northern suburbs of Phoenix, are divided over mask mandates, the presidential election and what to do about migrants on the border. But they are unified on one issue: the need for the United States to take in thousands of Afghan evacuees, and they are passing the plate to make it happen. “Even the most right-leaning isolationists within our sphere recognize the level of responsibility that America has to people who sacrificed for the nation’s...
__label__5 More journalists admit and embrace bias, dismissing 'fairness' in new era of mediaANALYSISA growing number of prominent journalists have declared once-bedrock press principles like fairness and objectivity to be outdated and unnecessary since the Donald Trump era rocked American politics, and while some observers appreciate the honesty, others feel blending opinion and reporting makes for a "dangerous time" in America.  As media members like CNN's Jim Acosta and PBS' Yamiche Alcindor became heroes to the left for their antagonistic approach to the president, who derided them and other reporters as "fake news," more journalists are leaving behind the image of the disinterested, impartial correspondent. "I do think it...
__label__3 From 9/11's ashes, a new world took shape. It did not last.ANALYSISIn the ghastly rubble of ground zero’s fallen towers 20 years ago, Hour Zero arrived, a chance to start anew. World affairs reordered abruptly on that morning of blue skies, black ash, fire and death. In Iran, chants of “death to America” quickly gave way to candlelight vigils to mourn the American dead. Vladimir Putin weighed in with substantive help as the U.S. prepared to go to war in Russia’s region of influence. Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, a murderous dictator with a poetic streak, spoke of the “human duty” to be...
__label__2 An Iowa town goes to battle for Afghan immigrantAt first glance, Iowa Falls might be an uncomfortable place for a devout Muslim. Pork, forbidden in Islam, is big business here, and there isn't a mosque for miles. And yet, for Zalmay Niazy – an Afghan who goes simply by "Zee" – Iowa Falls has been the answer to his prayers. "Iowa Falls is home," he told correspondent Lee Cowan. Niazy came to the U.S. after serving as an interpreter for both American and Allied forces in eastern Afghanistan. Every mission made him a target of the Taliban.  ...
__label__4 Biden reverses position on signing bipartisan infrastructure bill: ‘I fully stand behind it’President Joe Biden on Saturday backtracked on previous remarks he made on his intent to sign the nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package and confirmed he will "fully stand behind it." "The bottom line is this: I gave my word to support the Infrastructure Plan, and that’s what I intend to do," Biden said in a Saturday statement. "I intend to pursue the passage of that plan, which Democrats and Republicans agreed to on Thursday, with vigor." Adding: "It would be good for the economy, good for our country, good for our people. I fully stand behind it...
__label__3 This charity eliminates the middleman – cutting waste and expensesIn a city with as much abundance as there is need, a tiny Manhattan nonprofit aims to reallocate the excess – one cookie, one blender, and one bike helmet at a time.    Over the past four years, House of Good Deeds has funneled more than 150,000 pounds of clothes, household items, computers, catering equipment, and more from donors to recipients – keeping it out of landfills. Unlike organizations with concrete goals – disaster relief, ending homelessness, promoting literacy – this shoestring operation has a more profound purpose: fostering altruism. ...
__label__2 How a Coalition of Business and Labor Groups Helped Save the Infrastructure BillANALYSISAs Democrats and Republicans in Congress squabbled over blowing past the deadline on an infrastructure agreement, the business and labor communities were getting tired of the partisan fighting. Their leaders, who span both sides of the aisle and who had poured tens of millions of dollars into lobbying on this issue, just wanted a resolution, convinced that an investment of over $500 billion in new spending to improve the country’s broadband, transit systems and drinking water will be crucial to rebuilding a post-pandemic economy. “Our messages have not wavered in...
__label__4 Urban Policy Can Help Bridge Political DividesOPINIONUrbanists lament the fact that the average American knows and cares little about the built environment, but this sad reality has a significant upside. Because urban policy is a relatively fringe topic, it presents what is in today’s political climate a rare opportunity: the chance to make converts to conservative principles through rational persuasion. As the left and right solidify into ever more intransigent blocs, thoughtful dialogue has been relegated to internal discussions, while cross-faction exchanges have little hope of changing minds. There are myriad explanations for the trend, but...
__label__3 Poll Shows 81% Of Americans Support Taking In Afghans Who Assisted U.S.The vast majority of Americans in both parties support taking in Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the war in Afghanistan, a new poll found, as more than a half dozen Republican governors express support for taking in Afghan refugees. KEY FACTS A CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday found 81% of the 2,142 U.S. adults surveyed said the U.S. should “help those Afghans come to the U.S.,” while just 19% said they should not. Taking in those Afghans, who worked as translators, intelligence sources, drivers and in other support...
__label__1 America's partisan fireworks will be hard for anyone to put outOPINIONWhile July Fourth is the holiday that most directly celebrates Americans' common heritage, this year it comes as their extreme divides underscore how difficult it has become for any president to set a unified direction for the country. From vaccination rates to voting rights, from immigration policy to racial equity, blue and red states are hurtling in antithetical directions at staggering speed, even amid President Joe Biden's persistent calls for greater national unity and his attempts to foster more bipartisan agreement in Washington. Across all of these issues, and more, Republican-controlled states are pursuing...
__label__4 Republicans make better friends than Democrats, poll findsBuddy, pal, chum — what is the state of friendship among the political parties? One particular political persuasion appears to be more tolerant than others when it comes to cultivating simple friendships, and navigating political differences at the same time, according to an unusual new survey by the Survey Center on American Life, a project of the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy think tank. “Importantly, Republicans have more bipartisan friendships than Democrats do. A majority (53%) of Republicans say they have at least some friends who are Democrats. In...
__label__3 Where there’s smoke, there’s fire – and political unityANALYSISThe acrid smoke from massive wildfires that ignited in rural eastern Washington last Labor Day weekend drifted over the Cascades before blanketing the state’s populous western flank. Ashen clouds darkened the skies above Seattle, Tacoma, and the capital, Olympia, looming like a rebuke of state lawmakers for failing to alleviate a worsening wildfire crisis. The memory of that spectacle lingered after the haze cleared, and when the Legislature convened in January, a sense of urgency – and unity – prevailed in the statehouse. Republicans joined with Democrats to unanimously approve a wide-ranging wildfire...
__label__2 Democracies Don’t Try to Make Everyone AgreeOPINIONBack in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a required course in literary theory. This course—Lit 130, if memory serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could be applied to the reading of books. This was the heyday of deconstructionism—essentially a form of highly pretentious close reading, imported from France—and so we read quite a few texts looking for things that interested deconstructionists. But we also read Freudians, Marxists, feminists, and others.
__label__5 Barrett, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh side with liberal Supreme Court justices in computer fraud caseTrump-appointed Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch sided with liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Thursday to endorse a narrow approach on how to apply a 1986 law against computer hacking.  The justices overturned the conviction of a police officer, Nathan Van Buren, who was paid to run a license plate search in violation of the police department's policy and, according to the federal government, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But Barrett, writing for the majority, said the officer technically did not access information he...
__label__3 A timely lesson from a tiny town long agoANALYSISRecently, a friend gave me the book “A Stronger Kinship” by historian Anna-Lisa Cox. It tells of Covert, Michigan, a small town 30 miles from my friend’s childhood home.  His nearly all-white high school had played them in sports, yet only now was he learning that more than a century ago, Black and white residents of Covert had “lived as equal citizens,” as the book puts it.  As far back as the 1860s, they treated each other as neighbors regardless of race, farming side by side. Black men not only...
__label__1 Bipartisanship Lives, and Biden Takes a BowOPINIONDuring a lifetime in politics, Joe Biden has delivered countless eulogies, many of them for Republican colleagues in the Senate. Over the years, he has eloquently laid to rest John McCain, of Arizona; William Roth, of Delaware; Arlen Specter, of Pennsylvania; and even, controversially, the former segregationist Strom Thurmond, of South Carolina. He has delivered so many eulogies that the Times studied nearly sixty of them during the 2020 campaign, in search of insights into how Biden might lead the nation. On Wednesday, he took the Presidential motorcade up to Washington National Cathedral to bid...
__label__4 Let’s make a deal: Biden meets with GOP to talk ‘compromise’ on $2.3T spend planPresident Biden on Thursday met with six Senate Republicans to discuss possible compromise on his proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.Biden hosted the top Republicans on relevant committees a day after he hosted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the first time.“I’m prepared to compromise,” said Biden, who was joined by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
__label__3 This Democrat wants to fix potholes with Republicans, not steamroll themKyrsten Sinema, a once-strident liberal who now charts a pragmatic path, is spearheading Congress’ most significant infrastructure bill in years. Some Democrats see the bipartisan effort as capitulation. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema knows a thing or two about crusading for justice. As an activist back in the early 2000s, she protested the Iraq War in a pink tutu. And as a first-term Arizona state legislator, she routinely delivered scathing speeches against her Republican opponents, marching back to her office filled with righteous indignation – only to see the GOP’s bills pass.  Now,...
__label__2 Analysis: Biden rebuts doubts, wins bet on bipartisanshipANALYSISDay after day, as the partisan battle lines hardened on Capitol Hill over President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, his calls for bipartisanship seemed increasingly out of step. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his goal was to focus “100%” on stopping Biden’s agenda. Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, pushed Biden to use the brute force power of a majority, even the most slender one, to pass legislation without any GOP support. But on Thursday, it was Biden, the Washington careerist schooled in the ways of compromise, standing in front of the White...
__label__4 Republicans describe 'productive' meeting with Biden, but no deal on infrastructureHouse and Senate leaders in both parties met with President Joe Biden for more than an hour Wednesday for “productive” talks that have not yet yielded a critical deal on infrastructure. Biden told reporters at the start of the meeting he will “try to reach some consensus” on an infrastructure accord, but the two parties remain starkly divided on the size, cost, and offsets for the massive plan put forward by Biden. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, described the meeting as productive but said Biden’s plan to...
__label__3 Hopes and fears: Why Cuban protesters rally American left and rightWhen a video emerged from Cuba’s unprecedented anti-regime demonstrations this month of a Havana protester waving the American flag, the political right in the United States was quick to seize on the display as proof that Cubans hate communism and want American-style freedom. Some on social media juxtaposed the image of the Cuban waving the Stars and Stripes with scenes of American protesters burning flags at last summer’s police brutality and anti-racism demonstrations. Not to be outdone, the lead organization in the Black Lives Matter movement also felt compelled to...
__label__2 "We have a deal": Biden announces bipartisan compromise on infrastructurePresident Joe Biden threw his support behind an infrastructure proposal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, boosting momentum for the deal even as congressional leadership also presses forward with a larger bill addressing the more ambitious aspects of the president's agenda."We have a deal," Mr. Biden told reporters outside the White House after a meeting with the 11 senators of both parties who had negotiated the package. "We made serious compromises on both ends."
__label__4 Biden wants to govern for red states, White House says, despite lack of visitsPresident Joe Biden's coming visit to deep-red Louisiana is one of the few trips Biden has made to Republican states since taking office, following several trips to Democratic and swing states. Asked how people should perceive this, the White House suggested Biden's pledge to be a president for everyone still holds. "It's not about just delivering for people who voted for him or people who have blue check marks next to their name because they're Democrats, and that's part of what this visit shows," press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday,...
__label__2 Could a voter ID compromise be a win for voting rights?Faced with the reality that their ambitious voting rights reform plan may be permanently stalled in the Senate, Democrats have begun to soften their opposition to a policy they once criticized as the epitome of voter suppression: voter ID laws. The specifics vary from state to state, but voter ID laws generally require a person to present some form of identification in order to cast a ballot. These laws were relatively rare in the United States until the past two decades, when they became increasingly common in states led by Republican...
__label__2 Congress' most successful bipartisan gang lives in the House — not the SenateA few dozen House members helped bring bipartisan talks back from the dead on a massive spending bill passed six months ago. Now they want to do it again — in President Joe Biden's Washington. The bipartisan 58-member coalition known as the Problem Solvers Caucus took something of a half-court buzzer shot this week by releasing its own version of an infrastructure deal, determined to keep talks alive between the president and Senate Republicans at least a bit longer before Democrats bound toward their own party-line bill. By Thursday afternoon,...
__label__5 Biden Has Bipartisan Support On 3 Major Issues. Why Is He Ignoring Them?ANALYSISDespite his own calls for bipartisanship and unity, President Joe Biden is using the budget reconciliation process and executive orders to push policies that congressional Republicans do not support — despite the fact that there are some policy regions with genuine room for bipartisan progress.
__label__3 Infrastructure Deal Tests Whether Bipartisanship Can SurviveThe big infrastructure deal President Biden and a group of senators from both parties announced Thursday is about much more than infrastructure. It may well be a test of whether bipartisanship can survive in today’s Washington on any big subject. After all, if bipartisanship can’t be achieved on infrastructure—the motherhood-and-apple-pie issue of our times, where every lawmaker gets to send some federal dollars back home for projects their constituents can see and use—where can it happen? That doesn’t mean the $1.2 trillion deal—which would represent one of the biggest investments ever...

__label__5 Steele dossier key player gave thousands to Hillary, DemsA key player in the debunked Steele dossier gave thousands of dollars to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, according to Federal Elections Commission (FEC) filings reviewed by Fox News. FEC filings reveal that Democrat spin doctor Charles Dolan has given over $60,000 to Democrats, including Clinton – whom Dolan volunteered for on her failed 2016 campaign. Dolan, who has boasted on his now-deleted Twitter profile to have worked on "every Democrat Presidential Campaign since 1980," gave Clinton $5,000 for her 2008 presidential campaign. The public relations executive also donated to climate envoy John...

He shared their sentiments and thought he’d do something to show solidarity. So he presented them with a scenario.Supposing, Nearman told them, someone was hoping to breach the state Capitol, which has been closed to the public for over a year. Let’s say you called a certain cellphone number — his — and told Nearman you were standing just outside the building at a certain entrance.
__label__2 ‘They Learn to Parrot What They Know They’re Supposed to Say’OPINIONErin McLaughlin, an educator in Pennsylvania, believes that, in school and in life, people should study what others think and why. But in her estimation, many educational institutions that purport to value diversity and inclusion fail to treat viewpoint diversity—which she defines as “the recognition that nobody’s worldview is complete, and that no one marker of identity actually defines the way we see the world around us”—as a vital part of civic education. Her mission: to persuade educational institutions to put viewpoint diversity at the center of their cultures and...
__label__5 Walker off to fast start, hauling in $3.7M since launching Senate bidRepublican Senate candidate Herschel Walker has sprinted out of the blocks when it comes to fundraising for his Senate campaign to try and unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia in the 2022 midterm elections. The former professional and college football star running back, who won a Heisman Trophy and helped propel the University of Georgia to a national championship, announced Monday that his campaign pulled in $3.7 million — or about $100,000 per day — from his late August launch through the close of September, which marked the end of the third quarter of fundraising. Walker,...
__label__3 How Some Americans Are Breaking Out of Political Echo ChambersLAST OCTOBER, STUDENTS in Sarah Candler’s seventh-grade English class in rural Tennessee were discussing the presidential election, echoing each other’s pro-Trump sentiments. One student dared the others: “Who’s a Democrat, anyway?” A lone girl raised her hand. “I saw looks aghast from the other kids,” recalls Candler. Then Candler, too, raised her hand. The closed-minded dialog troubled Candler. She began searching online for resources beyond her go-to mainstream news sources, such as The New York Times, to help her understand others’ politics. She found AllSides, a site founded by former Netscape director John...
__label__2 Biden to confront limits of bipartisanship in first meeting with Congress’ ‘Big Four’The White House has billed President Biden’s first formal meeting Wednesday with Congress’ “Big Four” leaders, two from each party, as an opportunity to talk about where Democrats and Republicans can find “common ground” on the country’s most pressing issues. The early signs aren’t good. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he was “100%” focused on stopping Biden’s agenda. And just hours before the White House meeting, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield will lead his caucus’ expulsion of Wyoming’s Rep. Liz Cheney from its...
__label__4 Biden turns on the Democratic Party fundraising machine for 2022President Joe Biden's dive into the pool of high-dollar fundraisers this summer comes with an appeal to party unity and the promise of nailing big-ticket Democratic priorities — if donors give. "The DNC is going to need you because here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big, consequential things," Biden said at a fundraising event in June. At another Democratic National Committee fundraiser on Monday, Biden delivered virtual remarks from the White House focused on rousing...
__label__3 Between religious and LGBTQ rights, what does fairness look like?ANALYSISCasey Pick has always viewed Kim Colby with a certain amount of wary respect.  Both are accomplished attorneys, and both are advocates for causes that cut to the heart of their deepest selves. They are on opposite sides of what has been one of the nation’s most divisive and intensely personal political debates – about sex, gender, and the civic integrity of religious belief. Ms. Pick fights for policies that support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people, especially transgender youth in crisis. Over the years she’s...
__label__2 Democrats and Republicans need a translator when speaking infrastructureANALYSISDemocrats and Republicans in Washington often do not speak the same language anymore. Just as there are “red” and “blue” states, there are “red” and “blue” versions of infrastructure proposals. Democrats have an expansive view of infrastructure, including such things as home-care services, that Republicans deride as not “real” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. Meanwhile, Democrats want to add spending on top of existing appropriations, while Republicans include existing spending in their numbers, which make their budget proposals look bigger.
__label__5 House Republicans Grow Midterm Cash Advantage Over DemsThe House Republican fundraising arm outraised its Democratic counterpart in May, according to figures shared by the organizations. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised over $14 million last month, its third straight record-breaking month for fundraising, the group says. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the same month brought in just under $10 million. The May fundraising hauls bring the NRCC's cash on hand to $42.1 million, topping the DCCC's cash reserves by $6 million. Both groups have scored record fundraising numbers this year. The DCCC narrowly outraised the NRCC in April, but a $5...
__label__3 Respect: Is it the glue a polarized nation needs?Respect is a core civic value to American democracy, but it can also be used as a tool of repression. As a fractured nation seeks to knit itself together, the ability to disagree yet not hate is seen as essential. This is part of the Monitor’s Respect Project. Marquis Fulghum can get a little irritated with topics like tolerance. “When someone says they will tolerate me, it invokes a negative idea or feeling, and I’m not thinking this person accepts who I am,” Mr. Fulghum said at a recent public...
__label__1 GOP Lawmakers Release Surprisingly Great COVID-19 Vaccine AdANALYSISRepublican members of Congress who also happen to be medical professionals released a video on Tuesday encouraging people to get COVID-19 vaccinations ― an important public health message meant to counter vaccine hesitancy among their constituents. The video, organized by the 18-member GOP “Doctors’ Caucus,” stresses the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the U.S. government’s “rigorous and transparent” process of overseeing their development. “The FDA did not skip any steps,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), an anesthesiologist and caucus co-chair, assures about COVID-19 vaccines in the ad.  “The only way...

__label__3 Nine in 20 of us identify as independents. So how can we be polarized?OPINIONGallup's fresh quarterly assessment of Americans' political leanings finds 44 percent of Americans regard themselves as independents. This is a remarkable statistic — especially because we are living in a time when traditional media and social media continue to hammer away at the claim that we are a nation that is polarized. Our people are polarized and, the media's conventional wisdom holds, that is why they have sent politicians to Washington to engage in very little but horrific trench warfare — the policymaking equivalent of what happened when the Allies...

__label__4 The Science Behind the Trump Campaign's Recurring DonationsANALYSISEarlier this month, the New York Times reported that starting in March 2020, the Trump campaign had tricked many donors into signing up to make repeated donations, even when the donor intended to donate only once.  When supporters made donations through the WinRed website, the default setting—a checked box that the user would have to uncheck to opt out—would sign them up to make recurring donations—once a month or (later in the campaign) once a week, at the same dollar amount. The Times told the story of a donor...

__label__3 Biden redefined ‘bipartisan.’ GOP moderates say it leaves them out.Can a bill be bipartisan if it passes with only Democratic votes? The Biden administration says yes, if it includes GOP ideas and Republican voters support it. Republicans say the White House is courting a backlash. The last time Joe Biden gave a big speech on Capitol Hill, moderate Republican lawmakers were buoyed by what they heard. The newly sworn-in president might be a Democrat, but he had spent 36 years in the Senate. He understood Congress and how deals were done. On that blustery January day, as their former...

But having whipped his supporters into a frenzy with pledges to overturn the election and promises to support Republican candidates in the midterms, he is not spending his campaign money on either. A review of election filings from Make America Great Again PAC, Save America PAC, and the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee show that not a single penny was transferred or contributed from those Trump-affiliated entities to GOP candidates or committees involved...
__label__5 Left-Wing ‘Dark Money’ Networks Hid Millions in the 2020 ElectionsDespite repeated calls for increased campaign finance transparency, President Joe Biden and other Democrats received tens of millions of dollars in assistance from massive "dark money" networks during the 2020 election cycle.  The Sixteen Thirty Fund, which houses dozens of liberal groups and projects, pumped $60 million into committees backing Biden and other Democrats. Tides Advocacy, a similar group part of a larger dark money network, spent $1.6 million.  Dark money groups pouring large sums into elections is nothing new. But the 2020 election marks the first time...
__label__3 In Rare Moment Of Bipartisan Unity, Senate Approves Asian American Hate Crimes BillCapping nearly two weeks of talks between Democrats and Republicans, the Senate approved legislation on Thursday to ramp up law enforcement efforts to better protect the Asian American and Pacific Islander community from hate crimes. The move marks a rare moment of bipartisan unity needed to approve the Senate legislation despite a new political era marked by increasingly bitter party divisions. The bill, which needed 60 votes for passage in the evenly divided Senate, was approved by a vote of 94 to 1. Only Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley voted...
__label__2 Critical race theory battle invades school boards — with help from conservative groupsA booby-trapped billboard. A list of demands. A conservative media frenzy. Jeff Porter, superintendent of a wealthy suburban school district in Maine, had no idea that his community was about to become part of a national battle when in the summer of 2020 a father began accusing the district of trying to “indoctrinate” his children by teaching critical race theory. To Porter, the issue was straightforward: The district had denounced white supremacy in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by police, but did not teach critical race theory, the academic study of...
__label__5 Biden Institute Won’t Disclose DonorsThe Biden Institute, a policy research center founded by Joe Biden at the University of Delaware, has no plans to disclose its donors after the president-elect takes office, Politico reported on Monday. Legal experts and watchdog groups said the lack of transparency could create an ethical dilemma for Biden, particularly if he keeps his name on the institute and it continues to fundraise while he’s in the White House.

Why it matters: Prosecutors said Parnas, then an associate of former President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, funneled over $150,000 from a Russian businessman into U.S. campaigns as part of an effort to land licenses in the U.S.'s legal cannabis industry. Parnas also worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating President Biden for alleged corruption in the lead-up to the 2020 election. Details: A jury found Parnas guilty of scheming to...
__label__1 FBI Investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy Over Political FundraisingThe FBI is investigating controversial Postmaster General Louis DeJoy over campaign contributions connected to his former business, his spokesperson confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday. The Post was the first to report on the probe and spoke to people familiar with the matter, who said FBI agents had recently interviewed current and former employees of DeJoy and his former business, New Breed Logistics.
__label__5 Gavin Newsom recall effort just got a major boostThe California governor’s days could be limited thanks to a growing effort to invoke a statewide referendum.  A campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom is picking up steam after individual donors offered tens of thousands of dollars each and they scored $500,000 from an Irvine-based consulting firm.  Prov 3:9 LLC contributed $500,000, and Sequoia Capital's Douglas Leone and his wife Patricia Perkins-Leone contributed roughly $100,000.  Since 1911, Californians have attempted to recall their governor 55 times, but were successful only in 2003 against Gov. Gray Davis, who...
__label__3 As Virginia governor’s race tightens, McAuliffe and Youngkin report big fundraising numbersAs the Virginia gubernatorial race between former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and businessman Glenn Youngkin (R) tightens, Youngkin raised nearly $4 million more than McAulliffe in the latest reporting period giving him a race-leading total of $35.2 million. The former Democratic governor of Virginia was once seen as the favorite in the 2021 gubernatorial race. In McAuliffe’s last quarter in office in 2017, a Morning Consult survey found he had a 47% approval rating, landing him with a net 15% approval. At the time, McAuliffe was reportedly considering a presidential run in 2020 but ultimately decided not to run when...
__label__2 Trump Spawned a New Group of Mega-Donors Who Now Hold Sway Over the GOP’s FutureANALYSISWesley Barnett was just as surprised as anyone to learn from news reports that the Jan. 6 Trump rally that turned into a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol was funded by Julia Jenkins Fancelli, an heiress to the fortune of the popular Publix supermarket chain. But Barnett had extra cause for being startled: Fancelli is his aunt. Barnett said he was at a loss to explain how his aunt — who isn’t on social media, lives part time in Italy and keeps a low profile in their central Florida...
__label__5 Georgia’s Senate Runoffs Have Seen $272 Million In Ad Spending In Just 22 DaysCampaigns in Georgia’s two Senate runoff races have spent over $272 million advertising since Election Day, according to an AdAge analysis.Incumbent GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have reserved $168.5 million worth of ads up to the Jan. 5 runoff, while their respective Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, have collectively reserved $102.5 million, the analysis shows. The sums do not include outside spending that has flooded the two races, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
__label__3 "Perfect storm" blocks Trump-era FEC probesA "perfect storm" of procedural blockades prevented the investigation and sanctioning of alleged Trump campaign election law violations, regulators said this week. Why it matters: Legitimate cases are being dismissed. And critics say the Federal Election Commission's inability to crack down on many bad actors has undercut the threat of enforcement, and turned campaign financing into the Wild West. What's new: The FEC is clearing out a backlog of Trump-related cases. One of them, officially tossed last month, shows how the nation's top political money regulator has been hobbled. The case stemmed from a...
__label__2 'A nicer version of Trump': GOP donors flock to DeSantisOne evening in February, Ron DeSantis quietly slipped into the luxurious Charleston Place Hotel in South Carolina. Over dinner, the Florida governor addressed an audience of deep-pocketed donors convened by the influential Bradley Foundation, an organization that funnels cash to right-leaning nonprofit groups. DeSantis, whose attendance has not been previously reported, held forth for nearly an hour, detailing the anti-lockdown approach to the coronavirus pandemic that’s turned him into a conservative hero and propelled him to the upper echelon of potential 2024 GOP hopefuls. Art Pope, a longtime conservative benefactor...
__label__5 Hackers Steal Millions Of Dollars Out From Wisconsin Republican Party In Final Days Of Election: Party ChairmanHackers have stolen $2.3 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party in the final days of the election as President Donald Trump looks to secure re-election by winning the swing state, according to the party’s chairman. “The alleged hack was discovered less than two weeks before Election Day, as Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden made their final push to win Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes,” the Associated Press reported. “Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016 and was planning his third visit in seven days...
__label__3 Kochworld comes to Biden's defense on AfghanistanPresident Biden is getting some unlikely backing for his Afghanistan troop withdrawal from a longtime nemesis: the Koch political network. Driving the news: Concerned Veterans for America, a foreign policy-focused arm of Charles Koch's Stand Together political and policy apparatus is coming to Biden's defense after the U.S. withdrawal handed control of the country to the Taliban this week. The Koch political network was one of the foremost antagonists of the Obama administration in which Biden served as vice president. What they're saying: "I think he made the right decision to withdraw,"...
__label__1 Trump Campaign Used Tricks to Get Donors to Give More Money Than They IntendedANALYSISSupporters of former President Donald Trump sometimes dug deep into their finances to answer their candidate’s call for financial assistance in the run-up to the presidential election. What many of them found though is that they were unwittingly signed up to give recurring donations that sometimes depleted bank accounts. And the people who fell prey to these schemes weren’t just people who weren’t tech savvy, even veteran political operatives found that they were tricked into giving more than they wanted, reveals the New York Times in an investigation into the...
__label__5 Coastal donors pouring cash into tight Iowa Senate raceThe race for Iowa’s Senate seat, the second-most expensive contest in U.S. history, is neck-and-neck and the outcome may decide which party wields more power in Washington after Election Day. Heated fights are underway for a number of Senate seats this year, and each one is critical for control of the upper chamber of Congress, which signs off on both cabinet nominations and judgeships. The Iowa seat could mean the difference between a Democratic sweep and Republicans retaining a majority. In Iowa, polls indicate enthusiasm has been building for incumbent...
__label__3 Gretchen Whitmer Accused of 'Illegal Scheme' in Campaign Finance ComplaintDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is being sued by a conservative group that has alleged Whitmer broke campaign finance laws by accepting massive donations which exceed those allowed by law. The Michigan Freedom Fund, which says its mission is to fight for conservative policies on behalf of Michigan’s taxpayers, sued Whitmer for accepting more than the minimum of $7,150 from individual donors after viewing her re-election campaign’s financial disclosure from this calendar year. The group said Whitmer has accepted $3.4 million in what it called “illegal contributions” from at least 154 individual...
__label__2 Trumpworld’s next target: Building a dark-money machineLiberals spent years building a massive dark-money machine. Now conservatives are trying to match them. Major donors are convening at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort next month for a two-day gathering to talk about what went wrong in 2020 — and to build a big-dollar network to take back power. The summit is being sponsored by the Conservative Partnership Institute, an organization led by Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.). Trump is slated to headline the opening-night dinner, and the agenda...
__label__5 Biden Campaign Raising Money To Fund Post-Election Challenges, LitigationJoe Biden’s presidential campaign is well ahead in fundraising but it seems some of that money is going to “pre-fund” legal costs that could be associated with a protracted battle over the results of November’s presidential election. Biden, the Daily Beast notes, has around $435 million on hand — a record amount for a presidential campaign — and is raising around $150 per minute, making the 2020 election one of the costliest in history. At the rate Biden has been bringing in money, the outlet explains, he could stop fundraising...
__label__3 Midterm-Election Ad Spending Poised to Soar as Streaming TV Attracts CampaignsA top advertising-industry observer expects elections this year and next will see political ad expenditures of roughly $9 billion, more than doubling the amount spent in the 2018 midterm cycle. The spots are also likely to increasingly appear on television screens connected to the Internet by streaming-video players such as those made by Roku Inc., which dominates the device portion of a rapidly growing market known as connected TV. AdImpact, a firm based just outside Washington, says in a report first shared with The Wall Street Journal that it expects ad spending to...
__label__1 Democrats Now Dominate Dark Money Spending. They Still Want To End It.Democrats are pushing a sweeping package of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms as their top legislative priority in 2021. One of the pieces of the bill is a section requiring independent political groups that currently don’t have to disclose their donors ― whose donations are known as “dark money” ― to finally do so.  This provision, previously known as the DISCLOSE Act, has been a major part of Democrats’ campaign finance reform agenda for years. But one major thing has changed since 2010, when Republicans dominated dark...
__label__4 Disney Cruise Line to require children 5 and up to be vaccinated against COVID-19Children who set sail on Disney cruise ships will soon have to be vaccinated against COVID-19. All Disney Cruise Line guests ages five and over will be required to show proof of vaccination as of Jan. 13 on national and international trips, the company announced Wednesday. Kids younger than five will have to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken in the days before they board the ship. The cruise line currently requires that children 12 and over be inoculated. Disney had docked its cruise ships through the summer over pandemic concerns.
__label__3 Here Are The Billionaires Backing California’s Governor And His Opponent Caitlyn JennerCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election in two months, has drawn far more support from billionaire donors than any of his opponents — by a compelling margin.  Altogether, 23 billionaires have donated to a California gubernatorial candidate, according to a search of the California Secretary of State’s Cal-Access Campaign Finance database. Of those, 19 have backed Newsom, donating a combined $5.7  million while three have thrown their financial weight behind Republican challenger Caitlyn Jenner. Just one has donated to former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, also...
__label__2 Black Lives Matter Foundation Fundraised $90 Million in 2020 As It Expanded Its ReachThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the organization named for the social justice movement, raised more than $90 million in 2020 and gave roughly a quarter of that to local Black Lives Matter chapters and affiliated organizations, according to its impact report. The document says the group's fundraising broke records with average donations amounting to $30.64 with more than 10 percent recurring. Much of BLM's growth comes from the attention paid in 2020 to police violence against Black people as the heavy focus was placed on the deaths of...
__label__5 White House won’t be following DC Mayor Bowser in lifting COVID-19 mask requirement indoorsThe White House does not plan to follow Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's decision to end the requirement that people mask indoors."The White House follows CDC guidance which recommends masking in areas of high or substantial transmission," White House assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz told Fox News' Patrick Ward Tuesday.
__label__3 Supreme Court strikes down disclosure rules for political donorsThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a California law that required nonprofits to hand over a list of their biggest donors. Why it matters: Some campaign-finance advocates have feared the court will begin chipping away at disclosure rules more broadly, making it harder and harder to figure out who’s funding major political causes. The big picture: In a 6-3 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said California had subjected donors to the threat of public harassment and intimidation, undermining their First Amendment right to free association. Background: California requires nonprofit organizations...
__label__1 Oil Industry Reconsiders Donations to Elections Deniers--But Has Its Own Big LieANALYSISA parade of oil and gas companies nobly announced this week that they will review their political donations in the wake of last week’s riot in Washington, D.C. — an attempt to distance themselves from the spectacle of election fraud conspiracists and white supremacists attacking the Capitol building and temporarily halting the election certification process. Marathon Petroleum, Occidental Petroleum, and the employee political action committees for ConocoPhillips and BP temporarily froze their contributions. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are reviewing their donations. Even energy industry association spokespersons for the American Petroleum...
__label__4 CDC: No Record of Naturally Immune Transmitting COVID-19The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that it has no record of people who are naturally immune transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. In the fall, the CDC received a request from an attorney on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network for documents “reflecting any documented case of an individual who: (1) never received a COVID-19 vaccine; (2) was infected with COVID-19 once, recovered, and then later became infected again; and (3) transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to another person when reinfected.” SARS-CoV-2 is another name for the CCP (Chinese Communist...
__label__3 Conservatives sound alarm against taking Big Tech moneyANALYSISConservatives in Washington are growing much more leery of groups with financial ties to Big Tech. Driving the news: The American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group, will send a letter today warning Republican lawmakers and staffers to be aware of third-party lobbyists who receive funding from Big Tech in an attempt to "influence public policy on the Right" and "coopt the Republican party." Why it matters: Third-party influence is a key lobbying strategy for major companies in Washington and has in the past been very effective for Silicon Valley. Now it's becoming a...
__label__1 Arizona GOP Chair Urged Violence at the Capitol. The Mercers Spent $1.5 Million Supporting Her.THE STORMING OF the U.S. Capitol on January 6 has brought to the fore a host of activists on the extreme right whose violent rhetoric helped to create the conditions for an assault that left five dead. One of the most prominent of those activists is Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward. On December 19, Ward fired off a tweet urging President Donald Trump to “cross the Rubicon,” referring to the historical event that led to Julius Caesar declaring a dictatorship in ancient Rome. The tweet was shared by former...
__label__4 Why COVID-19 is spiking in highly vaccinated statesANALYSISThe coronavirus pandemic is still going. And as we head into the winter months, there are a number of questions about what might happen in states with high vaccination rates and mitigation measures. Some highly vaccinated states have seen massive coronavirus surges as of late, which might be a sign of what’s to come in the pandemic, according to Yahoo! News. What happens to the infected people in the upcoming days and weeks may be a signal of what to expect this winter and beyond. “The question now is whether above-average vaccination coverage and...
__label__3 How campaign finance corruption keeps the minimum wage lowOPINIONMany of us have worked from home during the pandemic, but not everybody has that luxury. Have you been to your local grocery store? Minimum wage workers who have kept food on our tables have been called "frontline heroes" – and yet when the chance arose to increase their wage to $15 an hour, the proposal was voted down. And the vote was not just along party lines – eight Democrats joined Republicans in rebuffing the bill. These votes are influenced by the massive power that special interests have over...
__label__1 Ted Cruz’s Georgia Runoff Fundraising Is Actually Going to His Campaign. He’s Not AloneSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) needs your help to keep the U.S. Senate in Republican hands. So blared a handful of Facebook ads that Cruz’s campaign committee purchased this month. But none of them were actually raising money for the Republican candidates in Georgia. Instead, every penny donated went directly to… Cruz. The Cruz campaign bought 15 separate ads on Facebook over the past two weeks, each featuring a video of the senator dramatically hyping the need to hold two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia runoff contests. “Gun-grabbing, tax hikes, open...
__label__5 Joe Biden ‘Got a Handle on COVID’OPINIONCLAIM: "Biden got a handle on COVID." — David Corn, D.C. bureau chief of Mother Jones The lib reporter made the assertion on Twitter in response to complaints from Democrats about President Joe Biden's lack of meaningful accomplishments, including his failure to criminally prosecute Donald Trump. VERDICT: WTF is he talking about? As of this week, almost 350,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Biden's watch at an average rate of 1,172 per day. That is more than the combined total of American combat deaths in the First and Second World Wars. It is the...
__label__3 Mike Pompeo pours cash into new PAC bearing his sloganFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is pouring money into a new political group amid speculation about a possible 2024 presidential run, records show. Why it matters: Champion American Values, formed in February, is the same phrase that Pompeo has been using lately including during remarks last month to an influential group of Republicans in Iowa, seen as a clear sign he's considering a 2024 bid. Between the lines: Pompeo hasn't officially declared his affiliation with the new PAC. But in records posted Thursday, his still-active House campaign committee reported...
__label__1 Jared Kushner signed off on secret payments to top campaign officials, source saysTop White House adviser Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, personally signed off on keeping salary payments to top campaign officials off the books, according to a person involved with the arrangements. Federal Election Commission records show that the Trump campaign has made no salary payments to chief strategist Jason Miller, who came on board in June, or to campaign manager Bill Stepien, who joined the campaign in late 2018 and took over the top job from Brad Parscale in July. Kushner agreed to both arrangements, and personally directed the payments...
__label__4 Regulator Reviewing Reports of ‘Rare’ and Serious Condition Linked to Moderna VaccineEurope’s drug regulator on Thursday confirmed it is investigating reports of a blood condition in recipients of Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. According to a bulletin posted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), it is reviewing six cases of capillary leak syndrome, considered a “very rare disorder,” after they were reported in the EMA’s EudraVigilance database. “At this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of capillary leak syndrome,” the EMA wrote on Thursday, adding that “these reports point to a safety signal … information on new,...
__label__3 ‘Dark money’ topped $1 billion in 2020, largely boosting DemocratsThe 2020 election saw more than $1 billion in “dark money” spending at the federal level, a massive sum driven by an explosion of secret donations boosting Democrats in a historically expensive cycle.  That’s according to an estimate from OpenSecrets. The billion-dollar sum includes a whopping $660 million in donations from opaque political nonprofits and shell companies to outside groups. In 2020, dark money groups preferred to bankroll closely-tied super PACs rather than spend the money themselves — politically active nonprofits that do not disclose their donors reported roughly...
__label__2 How much does a few billion dollars get you in 2020?OPINIONIn the heady days before the elections on November 3rd, when Democrats dared to dream of unified control of Washington and a coming progressive remake of America, two especially optimistic indicators elicited particular giddiness. First, of course, were the horse-race polls showing Joe Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by nine or so percentage points. But there was also the money race, which Democrats were winning handily: Mr Biden’s campaign raised $952m, or nearly 60% more than Mr Trump’s campaign, described by reporters as a profligate operation limping cash-strapped into...
__label__4 Senior NIH Doctor Pushes Back on COVID-19 Vaccine MandatesA top infectious disease doctor has raised alarm about COVID-19 vaccine mandates despite top federal officials recommending them for businesses, schools, and other institutions. Dr. Matthew Memoli, who runs a clinical studies unit within the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci—is scheduled to argue against COVID-19 vaccine mandates during a Dec. 1 seminar hosted by the agency, according to David Wendler, a senior NIH bioethicist who is planning the seminar. “There’s a lot of debate within the NIH about whether [a vaccine mandate] is...
__label__3 Big Tech Employees Opened Wallets for Biden CampaignEmployees of big technology firms were a key source of contributions for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, newly released campaign finance records show, eclipsing donations from employees at traditional Democratic fundraising sources such as banks and law firms. Employees of Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc., and Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. were the five largest sources of money for Mr. Biden’s campaign and joint fundraising committees among those identifying corporate employers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign finance reports. Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign received...
__label__1 Why Biden is crowdfunding his White House transitionANALYSISPresident-elect Joe Biden has begun crowdsourcing funds for his White House transition — sending out a call Friday for donations. Ordinarily, a presidential transition would be largely taxpayer-funded, but that money cannot be released until the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Emily Murphy, officially “ascertains” that Biden won the election. Despite the election having been called for Biden by all major media outlets — and despite the fact that key states have begun to certify his wins — Murphy has refused to do so. Biden has nevertheless begun...
__label__4 U.S. faces uneasy crossroads on COVID-19 before holidaysThe U.S. recovery from the crushing delta wave of the coronavirus is beginning to stall out, with case counts stuck around 70,000 per day for two weeks after a precipitous decline from the peak of the Sun Belt surge in September. A drop in hospitalizations, a key metric as people begin to “live with” the virus and vaccinated persons fend off breakthrough infections, also appears to be slowing around the 45,000 mark. The Mountain West is seeing some of the biggest surges, with states like Montana and Wyoming accounting for...
__label__3 Why corporations are rethinking political donationsBig banks, big tech, and other major companies are pausing political contributions, primarily to Republicans, after election results were challenged. But Sen. Rick Scott has special reason for concern. Dear reader:  My first inkling of trouble for Republicans came Sunday with this headline: “Marriott suspends donations to senators who opposed vote result.”  The hotel chain wasn’t alone. Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshares, too, told the website Popular Information that they were suspending donations. Soon the movement ballooned. Some big banks – Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase,...
__label__2 Money raised for Trump's election fights would help cover campaign debtWith President Trump refusing to acknowledge President-elect Joe Biden's victory and continuing to falsely declare himself as the winner of the White House, the president and his campaign are soliciting donations from supporters for an "election defense fund" designed to "defend the integrity" of the election. But the fine print shows that the full amount contributed to help the Trump campaign does not go toward efforts to ensure all votes are legally counted. Instead, at least half of each donation will go to paying off the campaign's debts, donation pages...
__label__4 Effectiveness of 2 of 3 COVID-19 Vaccines Used in US Drops Below 50 Percent After 6 Months: StudyThe effectiveness of the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States has declined in recent months, with protection against infection falling under 50 percent for two of them after six months, according to a new study. Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine dropped to 58 percent in September from 89.2 percent effectiveness in March, researchers found. During the same time frame, Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine fell to 43.3 percent from 86.9 percent, and Johnson & Johnson’s shot declined to 13.1 percent from 86.4 percent. Dr. Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration during the...
__label__3 Trump Megadonor Sheldon Adelson Has Given At Least $180 Million This Year, Despite Troubles At His CompanyBillionaire Las Vegas Sands chairman and chief executive Sheldon Adelson has a catchphrase he likes to say during his company’s quarterly earnings calls: “Yay, dividends!” However, Adelson hasn’t been able to use that favorite phrase since January, weeks before the Covid-19 pandemic brought his gaming and resort empire to a grinding halt. For most people, even billionaires, cutting off a major cash spigot might force them to cut back on extraneous expenses, like political donations. But not Adelson. The 87-year-old casino tycoon, who is worth roughly $31.8 billion, has stockpiled...
__label__2 Democratic Senate hopefuls are raising tons of money. They're also spending it.Democratic Senate hopeful Jaime Harrison of South Carolina raised $57 million between July and September. Sara Gideon in Maine raised more than $39 million in that same period. And Mark Kelly in Arizona brought in $38.7 million.  These eye-popping numbers shattered the previous record for fundraising, Beto O'Rourke's $38 million cash haul in the third quarter of 2018.  Now the Democrats are spending that money in the face of massive Republican super PAC funds. And it's left many Republican candidates with more cash on hand than the Democrats...
__label__4 Hundreds of Thousands to Go on Four-Day Nationwide Strike Over Vaccine Mandates: OrganizerA nationwide strike against vaccine mandates will take place from Nov. 8 to Nov. 11, according to the main organizer for the walkout, Leigh Dundas, a human rights attorney and public speaker. The event will kick off in Los Angeles on Monday. The locations of the marches have not yet been disclosed. The walkouts involve people from various industries such as trucking and telecom. Air and rail transport workers are not federally allowed to go on strike due to a law passed in 1926 named the Railway Labor Act, but some plan to protest...
__label__3 Forbes Estimates China Paid Trump At Least $5.4 Million Since He Took Office, Via Mysterious Trump Tower LeaseThursday night’s presidential debate, has in fact collected millions of dollars from government-owned entities in China since he took office. Forbes estimates that at least $5.4 million has flowed into the president’s business from a lease agreement involving a state-owned bank in Trump Tower. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China signed a lease for space in 2008, years before the president took office, paying about $1.9 million in annual rent. Trump is well-aware of the deal. “I’ll show you the Industrial Bank of China,” he told three Forbes journalists...
__label__2 Kamala Harris Debate Performance Gets Biden Campaign Financial Boost of $12 MillionA day after the vice presidential debate between Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence, the Biden campaign reported raising $12 million, a further financial boost to the campaign, Politico reports. Biden had brought in $10 million in the three hours following the first presidential debate against Donald Trump, which broke a fundraising record. Harris has already become a monetary draw for the campaign. In the 48 hours after she was selected by Biden to be his running mate, it raised $48 million. Biden supporters have been giving small...
__label__5 Pfizer and BioNTech to Request Authorization for COVID-19 Boosters for Adults 18 and UpPfizer and BioNTech will request authorization from the Biden administration to expand eligibility for their COVID-19 booster shots to the general population, multiple outlets reported on Tuesday.The request could be filed as soon as this week, sources told the New York Times and Washington Post. Both papers reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is likely to grant the request, although it wasn’t immediately clear exactly how soon the approval process would be completed.
__label__3 Trump Campaign Has Record-Setting Online Fundraising DayPresident Donald Trump’s campaign is setting records after a $26 million haul around the final presidential debate against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Thursday night. This marked the largest digital fundraising day in the campaign’s history. The campaign raised 30% more and reactivated 20% more past donors than the last debates. October is Trump’s largest digital fundraising month. “In the final days of 2016 we saw a surge in online donations which preceded a rise in public polling, leading directly to victory,” said Gary Coby, Trump 2020 digital director....
__label__2 ‘Zero-Covid is not going to happen’: experts predict a steep rise in US cases this winterA steep rise in Covid-19 cases in Europe should serve as a warning that the US could also see significant increases in coronavirus cases this winter, particularly in the nation’s colder regions, scientists say. However, there is more cause for optimism as America enters its second pandemic winter, even in the face of likely rises in cases. Evidence shows vaccine-conferred protection against hospitalization and death remains high several months after inoculation, vaccines for children older than 5 can reduce Covid transmission, and new antiviral medications hold the promise of making...
__label__5 For Whom Do the Covid “Fact Checkers” Really Work?OPINIONThere are two types of COVID19 survivors— those who have documented recovery from sars-cov-2 (either PCR, antigen or serology + tests) or those who have self-identified recovery from sars-cov 2 (said they had it). When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...
__label__3 Republican super PAC raised $92 million in SeptemberThe Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, raised more than twice as much this September as it did two years ago, according to an FEC filing that will go live Tuesday night. By the numbers: The SLF raised $92 million in September, spent $105 million, and ended the month with $113 million cash on hand, as Republicans work to maintain their majority on Nov. 3. That's compared to $37 million the PAC raised in September 2018. Why it matters: In competitive races, Democratic...
__label__2 US offering investment to boost COVID-19 vaccine capacityThe Biden administration is making billions of dollars available to drugmakers to scale up domestic production of COVID-19 vaccines in the hopes of building capacity to produce an additional 1 billion shots per year to share with the world. Under the new initiative, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is soliciting pharmaceutical companies that have demonstrated the ability to make the more-effective mRNA vaccines to bid for government investment in scaling up their manufacturing abilities. Drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna produce the two U.S.-approved mRNA shots. The Biden...
__label__4 Eric Adams says he wants to end NYC’s school mask mandate, calls himself ‘conservative’ on crimeMayor-elect Eric Adams took to the airwaves Sunday and declared he wants to nix mask mandates in the classroom and called himself “conservative” on public safety. Adams fears masks are stopping students from making friends and said he wants to end the school mask mandate when he takes office come Jan. 1. “If we can find a safe way to do it, I look forward to getting rid of the mask,” Adams told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday morning. “Part of the socialization of a child is that...
__label__3 Trump Campaign Rakes in $135 Million Less Than Biden in SeptemberDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is shattering fundraising records leaving President Donald Trump’s campaign with significantly less cash heading into the upcoming November election. Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump campaign, took to Twitter to announce Trump’s fundraising numbers for September. “President Trump hits final stretch with strength, resources, record & huge ground game needed to spread message and secure re-election,” Murtaugh wrote. He added, “Campaign, RNC & joint committees in September: $247.8M raised $251.4M cash on hand POTUS has done more in 47 months than Biden in...
__label__1 The big questions about Covid-19 booster shotsOPINIONAll of a sudden, it seems a lot of people are getting Covid-19 booster shots. The additional doses of Moderna’s and Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccines have been approved in the US for people 65 and up as well as at-risk populations, such as people with certain health conditions and front-line workers. Everyone who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can now get a booster. Meanwhile, Pfizer is asking for approval of booster shots for all Americans who previously got its vaccine. But underlying the booster mania is a question that many experts say remains unanswered:...
__label__5 Aaron Rodgers: I’m In The Crosshairs Of The Woke Mob Right NowGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers voiced his frustration over the media criticizing his medical choices. On Friday, Rodgers publicly addressed his stance on the vaccine after testing positive for the virus earlier in the week. “The situation I’m in should be a conversation, not a controversy,” said Rodgers. The player emphasized he isn’t anti-vaccine, but believes the vaccine isn’t in his best health interests after previously mentioning he was allergic to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines. Instead, the player claimed he took ivermectin to fight the virus.
__label__3 Florida GOP limits vaccine mandates, flouting White HouseFlorida Republicans approved a sweeping bill Wednesday to hobble coronavirus vaccine mandates in businesses, rejecting claims that they were sacrificing public health to hand Gov. Ron DeSantis a win in his fight against White House virus rules. Lawmakers in GOP-controlled statehouse expedited the measure, along with a package of virus bills, after hours of debate in which Republicans maintained they were protecting workers from onerous mandates by the federal government. “If you want to get a vaccine, you can get a vaccine. If you don’t want to get a vaccine,...
__label__1 No, Workers Aren’t Striking Because of Vaccine MandatesOPINIONThere’s a meme traveling around conservative media that vaccine mandates are the cause of the ongoing strike wave. Although you certainly can find news stories here and there about someone quitting due to a vaccine mandate or a small-scale labor protest (such as a slowdown or sickout) due to the vaccine mandate, it is clearly not the case that opposition to the vaccine mandate is driving the much bigger labor market developments. The real driver is labor market tightness. Quits Quit rates and levels tend to move in lockstep with...
__label__5 Vaccine or Bust: Biden Orders 84M Americans to Take the Jab - Will a Third of US Workers Quit?ANALYSISThe jab or your job? That's what 84-million Americans are facing after the Biden administration has finally, officially, released the President's vaccine mandate against private businesses. More than two dozen states are pushing back, and millions of employees say they'll lose their jobs rather than take the shot. But the message from the Biden Administration is vaccine or bust. The President is demanding that all businesses with more than 100 employees should force them to take a COVID-19 vaccine.  The order calls for businesses to either require vaccinations – or...

But in many cases, those investments turned out to be doing more harm than good.Why it matters: In some cases, the efforts to keep kids and teachers safe in schools may not be as effective as claimed. In other cases, the air cleaning systems could be exposing them to the harmful toxins ozone and formaldehyde, experts warn.

__label__4 Voters Are Done With COVID-19 and Pandemic-Powered OfficialsANALYSISPoliticians have been on a high over the last year-plus, wielding extraordinary power with the approval of voters fearful of viral infection. Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...
__label__3 U.S. plans to invest billions in manufacturing COVID-19 vaccineThe United States is planning to invest billions of dollars in expanding COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity to make available an additional one billion doses per year, a Biden administration official said on Wednesday. The announcement to be made Wednesday comes as the administration of President Joe Biden faces pressure from activists to increase the vaccine supply to poorer countries. The investment in vaccine production is part of a private-public partnership to address vaccine needs at home and around the world and also to prepare for future pandemics, Dr. David Kessler,...
__label__1 Why are rich countries still monopolizing Covid-19 vaccines?OPINIONAbout half of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. The more than 7 billion shots administered so far are a massive, record-breaking public health achievement. But more than 50 countries have vaccinated less than 25 percent of their populations. Vaccines aren’t distributed equally: Rich countries have about twice the population of low-income countries, yet they have received about 50 times as many Covid-19 vaccine doses, according to an October report from the People’s Vaccine Alliance. The countries with the lowest incomes generally have the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates. This vaccination gap...
__label__4 Labor Secretary Insists OSHA COVID-19 Vaccine Rule Is Not a MandateLabor Secretary Marty Walsh, during a media blitz on Thursday, said that the new Biden administration rule that requires private employees to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or get tested for COVID-19 on a regular basis is not a mandate. “This isn’t a mandate—this is a vaccine or testing,” Walsh, a former mayor of Boston, said during an appearance on MSNBC. “What we want to do is just encourage people to get vaccinated, if they choose not to get vaccinated, we’re asking—they’re going to get tested and then, in the...
__label__3 8 lingering questions about the new Covid pills from Merck and PfizerThe past two months have brought extremely good news in the fight against Covid-19. Two different oral treatments have proved effective at both preventing people newly diagnosed with Covid-19 from entering the hospital and from dying. “We’re accelerating our path out of this pandemic,” President Biden said after data on the second Covid pill became available. The wide availability of oral drugs could make Covid-19 less lethal, making it less risky for people to return to in-person work and to their normal lives. The first results, from Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics,...
__label__1 The case for mandating Covid-19 vaccines for kidsOPINIONAll of America’s school-aged children can now get the Covid-19 vaccine. But should kids be required to get it? Schools in every state, after all, already mandate vaccines for a range of diseases. These mandates have a long history in the US, with some states requiring immunization in schools as early as the 19th century. One goal of the mandates is to stop the spread of potentially deadly diseases, but another is to prevent outbreaks from disrupting the classroom as kids get sick and stay home. Covid-19 has very much disrupted schools in the past...

OSHA’s explicit threat that the rule could eventually extend to smaller businesses in the near future has also pushed politicians, attorneys, and business owners to take legal action. Here are the conservatives who are suing Biden and his administration for forcing the COVID-19 jab...

Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...

About three-fourths of the nation's largest districts required masks at the start of the school year.

Jones was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2002 for the murder of Oklahoma businessman Paul Howell.

Another said she didn’t buy the testimony of an officer and his colleagues, concluding that they had stopped a car not because they’d seen its occupants break any laws but because it was driven by “three young men of color.” A third jurist toyed with using the word “perjury” to describe the testimony of an officer who repeatedly contradicted himself, claiming, for example,...

The disease? Smallpox. For the past four decades, all 50 U.S. states have required that parents, if they want to enroll their children in any school, public or private, must vaccinate them against contagious diseases like polio and measles. The reason is simple: High rates of vaccination dramatically cut deaths and have all but eliminated some diseases.

__label__2 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...
__label__2 What Philadelphia Reveals About America’s Homicide SurgeNakisha Billa’s son was still a baby when she decided to make their first flight to safety. It was early in 2000 and she and Domonic were living in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Kensington, which had long suffered some of the highest crime rates in the city. Billa was 22, proud to be living in her own place after having been raised in West Philadelphia mostly by her grandparents, and flush with the novelty of motherhood. “When I found out I was carrying Dom, it was the best thing...

__label__3 Inside the controversial US gunshot-detection firmShotSpotter's incident-review room is like any other call centre. Analysts wearing headsets sit by computer screens, listening intently. Yet the people working here have an extraordinary responsibility. They make the final decision on whether a computer algorithm has correctly identified a gunshot - and whether to dispatch the police. Making the wrong call has serious consequences. ShotSpotter has garnered much negative press over the last year. Allegations range from its tech not being accurate, to claims that ShotSpotter is fuelling discrimination in the police. In the wake of those negative...
__label__1 New Documents Show Pentagon Rubber-Stamping Police Requests For Military GearLast summer, as one city after another broke out in protest against the murder of George Floyd, some of the most enduring images were not of the demonstrators, but of the police: decked out in riot gear, aiming automatic weapons at peaceful crowds, and riding around on armored vehicles built for war. The crackdowns on protesters renewed furious demands to end a suite of federal programs that have put billions of dollars’ worth of military weapons in the hands of local police. President Joe Biden singled out the most infamous...

Adams fears masks are stopping students from making friends and said he wants to end the school mask mandate when he takes office come Jan. 1. “If we can find a safe way to do it, I look forward to getting rid of the mask,” Adams told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday morning. “Part of the socialization of a child is that...
__label__3 Nikolas Cruz: Parkland gunman pleads guilty to murdering 17A Florida man has pleaded guilty to murdering 17 people in a 2018 mass shooting at a high school campus in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 23, also pleaded guilty to 17 counts of attempted murder for those he injured in the attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He faces the possibility of the death penalty or life in prison. One of the deadliest school shootings in US history, the incident became a rallying cry for gun control activists. Mr Cruz was 19-years-old when he shot dead 14 students and...
__label__2 Can Biden Finish What Obama Started And Close Down Guantanamo?ANALYSISNineteen years after he was captured in Afghanistan, and five years after a review board ruled he posed no threat to the United States, Abdul Latif Nasser was finally released this month from the U.S. military prison complex at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and repatriated to his native Morocco. He became the first prisoner transferred from the notorious detention facility in more than three years. The move became the first real sign that there’s an effort underway to close Guantanamo. Since President Joe Biden came into office, however, administration officials at the Pentagon,...
__label__4 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__2 Do police belong in America's schools?An 18-year-old woman in Long Beach, Calif., who was shot in the head by a school safety officer earlier this week, was taken off life support on Friday, according to a family attorney. Mona Rodriguez, the mother of a 5-month-old child, was allegedly involved in an altercation near a local high school on Monday that prompted the officer to intervene. As Rodriguez and two others attempted to leave the scene, the officer fired at least two shots into the back of the car they were riding in, video of the incident shows....

Can he sell its students on compromise?It’s Sunday, just after 11 a.m. and dozens of current and former Howard University students and alumni sit on black folding chairs under a white tent outside the famed Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel. A choir of more than a dozen stand in front of a crowd singing a gospel song that holds a little extra weight this year. “Hold out, don’t give up. Help is on the way.” The help students want is both specific and broad. At its simplest level, they are demanding that the school fix their living...
__label__4 Inflating Grades For Social JusticeOPINIONAt a party over the weekend I was introduced to a college professor, and fell into conversation with him about teaching and Covid. Then I asked about how wokeness affects his teaching. I had no idea of the man’s politics, but I would bet the farm that he is a liberal, given that his academic field skews heavily to the left. He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...
__label__3 Guantanamo: A former prosecutor’s solution to an ‘unsolvable problem’There’s no simple way to close Guantanamo Bay. According to one former prosecutor, political courage may be the key to justice in this case. When Omar Ashmawy, then a United States Air Force officer, volunteered for the job of prosecuting Guantanamo Bay detainees in 2007, he had high hopes for America’s prospects of dispensing justice.  “I believed in the idea that military tribunals historically have been a way for nation-states to resolve crimes against humanity, and I think terrorism very much qualifies as a crime against humanity,” he says.  The...

Cornell, Columbia, and Brown Universities all issued emergency alerts after receiving bomb threats Sunday afternoon. They each evacuated buildings and cautioned students to stay away from campus. In Ithaca, New York, Cornell police cordoned off the center of campus on Sunday after receiving a call that bombs were placed in four buildings. In New York City, Columbia University police issued a campus-wide emergency alert after receiving bomb threats at...
__label__4 MIT Canceled a Professor's Guest Lecture Because He Opposes Race-Based AdmissionsANALYSISDorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...
__label__3 Democrats see political peril in replacing Minneapolis PDAs activists mobilized this summer to ask Minneapolis voters to replace their police department, one of the first prominent Democrats to slam the plan was a moderate congresswoman who doesn’t even live in the city. Angie Craig declared it “shortsighted, misguided and likely to harm the very communities that it seeks to protect.” She warned that it could push out the city’s popular Black police chief. Craig’s district covers a suburban-to-rural and politically divided region south of the city, but her willingness to jump into the fight next door highlights...

The University of California Hastings College of the Law does not have the power to change the name, which is written in state law. But the board of directors voted unanimously Tuesday to allow the dean to work with the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to introduce legislation required to do so. "We never shied away from that history, or I never did, and I wanted to confront it," said...

They may never be foundANALYSISA week before school started in the sunny desert city of St. George, Utah, Mike Carr waited at the front desk of the only emergency youth shelter in this southern Utah county. He noticed a young mother on a sectional couch in the living room swaddling her infant in a pink blanket, idly watching a Marvel movie. In the neighboring kitchen, some teenagers — each a potential student that Carr hoped to talk to — prepared lunch before retiring to one of the shelter’s 15 beds. Carr runs a one-person...
__label__3 At police lines, not all journalists are created equalOPINIONFor a lot of journalism’s history, BIPOC experiences have been told through a white lens. Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...
__label__2 ‘I Don’t Want to Die for It’: School Board Members Face Rising ThreatsIt was only days after Sami Al-Abdrabbuh was re-elected to the school board in Corvallis, Ore., that the text messages arrived. The first, he said, was a photograph taken at a shooting range. It showed one of his campaign’s lawn signs — “Re-Elect Sami” — riddled with bullet holes. The second was a warning from a friend. This one said that one of their neighbors was looking for Mr. Al-Abdrabbuh. The neighbor was threatening to kill him. Like many school board races this year, the one in May in Corvallis,...

St. Albans, whose alumni include vice presidents and two current U.S. senators, is considering a crackdown on "harmful" speech that prioritizes the impact of the speech rather than the intent of the speaker. "It is the impact of hate speech, rather than the intent of those perpetrating it, that is...
__label__3 Bipartisan police reform negotiations end without dealBipartisan talks on reforming police tactics and accountability, prompted by George Floyd's murder in May 2020, have ended without a compromise, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a key negotiator, said Wednesday. Why it matters: Lawmakers, led by Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Booker, had been working toward a bipartisan deal for months but things fell apart due to disagreements on qualified immunity and other issues. Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits unless they violate a clearly established constitutional right. It generally means public officials are...
__label__1 One Small Town’s Big Battle Over Critical Race TheoryANALYSISLast year, after George Floyd’s murder by police, Kara Fikrig, a white 28-year-old working on her doctorate in entomology at Cornell University (“mosquitoes,” she explained), began to reflect on the ways her small hometown of Guilford, Connecticut, hadn’t adequately prepared her for difficult conversations about race and racism. As an undergraduate at Yale, Fikrig said, she “wasn’t immediately exposed to different ideas in terms of diversity and a more complete history of the United States.” But her best friend at undergrad was Black, and in their discussions about news events and...
__label__5 'Domestic Terrorism'? Biden's AG Tells FBI to Protect School Boards from Parent ProtestersU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has directed the FBI to work with law enforcement to protect school board members, teachers, and other public school employees after some rowdy parent protests. Garland's order comes after numerous school board meetings across the country erupted in chaos as parents voiced their concerns about serious issues, including the teaching of Critical Race Theory, transgender policies, graphic sexual content, and pandemic restrictions like mask mandates. Those debates have led parents and board members to face off in heated discussions and angry outbursts. 'You Are Predators':...

USC President Carol Folt said that in late September its Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention Services, a counseling resource, received between five and seven "confidential disclosures" of possible drugging and sexual assault at a fraternity. Campus-wide communications weren't sent until about a month later. "We now know that there was a troubling delay in acting on this information, and specifically in evaluating it for...
__label__4 Teachers Union Boss Accidentally Endorses School Choice While Rushing To Support Masking in SchoolsANALYSISThe performative politics of mask mandates have produced some weird moments during the pandemic. Now, they've even managed to get a prominent teachers union boss to argue in favor of school choice. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, on Monday night tweeted out a story from the Detroit News about how parents are navigating the complexities of some school districts in Michigan mandating that children wear masks in the classroom while others don't. At the center of the story is a mother, Janine Fogg, who recently pulled her kids out of public schools in Brighton,...
__label__3 Study shows Black offenders more likely to get federal life sentencesBlack Americans are more likely to get federal life sentences than whites or Latinos, a new study has found. Why it matters: The analysis, published recently in Criminology further illustrates the racial disparities of federal sentencing at a time when advocates are pushing for sentencing reforms for nonviolent offenders. Details: An examination of more than 366,000 offenders convicted and sentenced in 90 federal district courts from 2010 to 2017 found racial disparities around life sentences targeting Black offenders. (The research excluded offenses related to immigration law.) More than 4,800 of all offenders were eligible...
__label__2 ‘Threats of violence’: School boards curb public comments to calm raucous meetingsParents in one Kentucky school district must communicate with their school board via email after a meeting devolved into a shouting match. In northern Virginia, school officials restricted who is eligible to speak at their meetings. A Florida school board is considering shortening public comment to one minute per person. School leaders nationwide are beginning to eye ways to rein in public commentary at local meetings in an effort to quell raucous crowds over hot-button issues like mask mandates and critical race theory. The potential changes could add more strain...
__label__4 Washington state school required White privilege training for teachersA Washington state public high school required its teachers in 2018 to undergo mandatory training in White, heterosexual male privilege. The suburban Tumwater School District, southwest of Tacoma, hired a consultant to help the predominantly White high school faculty “examine our privilege” and learn about microaggressions at a two-hour, in-service session, according to a teacher who anonymously sent materials to the conservative advocacy group Parents Defending Education (PDE) on Aug. 4. “Because everyone was terrified to contribute to the discussion we were supposed to be having, lest we offend someone...

__label__2 The Federal Government Gave Billions to America’s Schools for COVID-19 Relief. Where Did the Money Go?After the pandemic shut down schools across the country, the federal government provided about $190 billion in aid to help them reopen and respond to the effects of the pandemic. In the year and a half since millions of children were sent home, the Education Department has done only limited tracking of how the money has been spent. That has left officials in Washington largely in the dark about how effective the aid has been in helping students, especially those whose schools and communities were among the hardest hit by the pandemic....
__label__4 Students in this state don’t have to quarantine after COVID-19 exposureFlorida students do not have to quarantine after they are exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, leaving the decision up to individual families. Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the newly-appointed surgeon general for Florida, signed new protocols for the state that allows parents to decide whether their children should quarantine after COVID-19 exposure or stay in school, according to NPR. Ladapo eliminated mandates that required students to quarantine for four days after they were exposed.

Former U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr officially designated as special counsel last year, is reportedly exploring criminal charges against lower-level FBI officials and tipsters who may have provided false leads to the bureau in the 2016 investigation.

According to the poll – which was released by USA Today and Ipsos last week – 55% of parents "believe online learning caused their children to fall behind in school." That’s up from May 2020, when 46% of parents felt the same way.  Many parents do believe their children will be able to make up lost progress, however, according to the survey. Ipsos found 67% of...
__label__1 In push for police reform, small steps no longer enoughPolice reform used to be about small steps. But the past year has brought a seismic shift. The goal is now to reconsider the nature of policing itself. When it comes to policing and violence, Ronal Serpas has what might seem like an odd suggestion: Wind the clock back 50 years. As heated as the public debate around policing is today, years of social unrest had the United States in a similar place in the 1960s. In response, President Lyndon Johnson set up a commission to explore the problems and...

The administration has delayed movement on student debt cancellation while waiting for the Education Department’s review of presidential authority to cancel debt, which has dragged on for more than six months. With the pandemic pause on student debt payments set to expire in January, a group of progressive House members, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), made clear on Friday that they’re tired of...

American schoolchildren and lunch ladies grimace. And now the federal government is stepping in to help. School districts in Kansas can’t get whole-wheat flour, ranch dressing or Crispitos rolled tacos right now. In Dallas, they can’t put their hands on flatware, plates and napkins. In New York, school districts are unable to find antibiotic-free chicken, condiments or carrots. With the school year in full swing, product shortfalls, delivery delays and labor shortages have pushed the nation’s public...
__label__3 Perspective: Welcome to ‘woke’ universityOPINIONBefore 2020 began and life came to a screeching halt, it had grown obvious to observers of higher education trends that something very strange, even dangerous, was unfolding at universities across the country. Perhaps the peculiar situation first became evident in the fall of 2015, when a group of Yale University students surrounded one of their professors and berated him for failing to protect them from offensive ideas, screaming, “You have created space for violence” and “I am sick looking at you.” Maybe matters became clear when in early 2017 students at...
__label__2 Atlanta spa shootings: Georgia man pleads guiltyA Georgia man charged with shooting dead eight people in three Atlanta-area spas in March has pleaded guilty to murdering four of the victims. Robert Aaron Long made the plea as part of an agreement with state prosecutors. They have recommended a sentence of four life terms without parole. However, they are seeking the death penalty for Long, 22, if he is convicted on the other four counts. Six of the victims of the attack on 16 March were women of Asian descent. Mr Long has said his attack was...

While the city reopened schools last fall for part-time learning, the vast majority of students chose to keep learning remotely. But with no remote option now available to almost all parents, classrooms will be full for the first time in a year and a half.

In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...
__label__1 A COVID strategy backfires at schoolsHundreds of school districts and universities around the country rushed to invest in new electronic air cleaning systems in the last two years to help alleviate COVID concerns. But in many cases, those investments turned out to be doing more harm than good.Why it matters: In some cases, the efforts to keep kids and teachers safe in schools may not be as effective as claimed. In other cases, the air cleaning systems could be exposing them to the harmful toxins ozone and formaldehyde, experts warn.
__label__4 Texas Teachers Asked to Snitch on Colleagues Promoting ‘Radical Politics and Weird Theories’Some teachers at the Dallas Independent School District woke up to an email this week asking them to rat out any fellow employees for supposedly promoting so-called “critical race theory” and “predatory gender fluidity.” And they’re not happy about it. Two teachers who received the email on Wednesday shared their reactions with The Daily Beast. Both teachers requested to remain anonymous for fear of being reported on amid an increasingly tense environment for teachers. “I was incredulous that someone would take the time to write and disperse it,” one middle school...

After seeing enrollment in government-run K-12 schools decline by 3 percent in COVID-marred 2020–21 (including 13 percent for kindergarten and pre-K), all while homeschooling tripled, the $122 billion question facing this new school year is whether that defection is an aberration or inflection point. Given the amount of time that families have now had to plan around school-opening policies that have been among the most cautious in the developed world, would they choose their neighborhood school, or seek alternative solutions...
__label__1 Is civics education a ‘right’? Rhode Island case tests theory.An educated society is vital to democracy, but are schools obligated to teach students how government works? And who should decide that, the states or the courts? Both questions are at the heart of an appeals case in Boston. Growing up in Providence, Rhode Island, Ahmed Sesay never had a class in civics. When he graduated from high school in 2019, he had to teach himself how to vote and pay his taxes. Now 20 years old, Mr. Sesay is part of a lawsuit being decided by a Boston-based court...
__label__4 Biden Administration Promises to Help School Districts That Defy DeSantis’ Mask Mandate BanThe Biden Administration is offering a helping hand to school districts that are fed up with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ handling of COVID-19. In a Friday letter to DeSantis and Florida’s Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona offered financial assistance to schools in the state implementing their own mask mandates to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On July 30, DeSantis announced an executive order banning school districts from imposing mask mandates for students. As punishment for defiance, DeSantis said that he would strip pay for teachers and administrators in Florida...
__label__3 State Bans on Critical Race Theory Won’t WorkOPINIONI knew we’d lost the day I met the superintendent of North Carolina’s schools in 2011. I was leading a nonprofit whose civics curriculum was a stark improvement over the mishmash that the state’s teachers were then using. The Legislature had recently passed the Founding Principles Act, which required North Carolina schools to teach concepts like property rights, due process and federalism. Unlike the textbooks then in use, our materials were loaded with facts and original documents, illuminating concepts that undergird the U.S. Constitution and its founding. We were offering...
__label__2 Economics 101: More college classes bring moral debates to the surfaceProfessors have often presented economics as the realm of rational people making efficient choices. Now many are highlighting the ethical questions behind the theories. For the past five years, economists Wendy Carlin and Sam Bowles got professors from around the world to ask thousands of first-year economics students one basic question on their first day of class. What is the most pressing problem economists should be addressing? Among responses such as globalization, digitalization, and unemployment, two concerns dwarf the rest in the most recent data: inequality and climate change.  But...
__label__5 Inflation emerges as a 2022 campaign dividing lineTight congressional races across the nation are quickly turning into battlegrounds over a key economic question: whether President Joe Biden’s spending agenda is the chief culprit for inflation concerns gripping the country. Republicans are latching onto heightened anxiety tied to the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in three decades. Democrats, meanwhile, are scrambling to preempt the attacks by focusing on broader benefits of the multitrillion-dollar packages. The opposing bets on the infrastructure and social spending plans are laying the groundwork for a year of sparring tied to voters’ growing worries about...

__label__2 What’s behind the growing gap between men and women in college completion?DATAThe growing gender gap in higher education – both in enrollment and graduation rates – has been a topic of conversation and debate in recent months. Young women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, and among those ages 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have a four-year college degree. The gap in college completion is even wider among younger adults ages 25 to 34. Women’s educational gains have occurred alongside their growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy. The implications...

Regarding the Senate, 46% of registered voters said they wanted the GOP to take control of the upper chamber. A total of 42% hope...
__label__2 COMIC: If history is a guide, schools will start requiring COVID vaccinesANALYSISThe first time kids had to get a vaccine to go to school was more than 200 years ago. The disease? Smallpox. For the past four decades, all 50 U.S. states have required that parents, if they want to enroll their children in any school, public or private, must vaccinate them against contagious diseases like polio and measles. The reason is simple: High rates of vaccination dramatically cut deaths and have all but eliminated some diseases. But as long as there have been vaccines, there have been people who oppose them, formerly known as...
__label__5 Beto O’Rourke to run for governor of Texas in 2022 electionBeto O’Rourke, a former congressman, Senate candidate and contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, will run for governor of Texas next year. O’Rourke is seeking to take on Greg Abbott, the Republican governor who is pursuing a third term. Abbott is seen as more vulnerable than he was previously, given demographic changes and events including the failure of much of the Texas power grid during a period of very cold weather in February of this year, which led to numerous deaths. “I’m running for governor,” O’Rourke announced on Monday. “Together, we can push past the small and divisive...
__label__3 In ‘Deep Blue’ New York, Voters Reject Democrats’ Push for Election ChangesIn one of the bluest states in the nation, voters soundly rejected proposed changes to election law that congressional Democrats are trying to impose nationally.  New York state voters voted “no” on Democrat-supported amendments to the state Constitution, pitched as “voting rights” measures, that would have expanded absentee voting, allowed same-day voter registration, and changed the rules on drawing legislative districts.  Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year have passed four bills that were variations of their initial bill, HR 1, dubbed the “For the People Act.” The measures would ban...
__label__2 Why education was a top voter priority this electionIt touches most every household in the United States, whether as taxpayers or as parents, but come Election Day, education rarely makes it to the top of voter priorities. That wasn't the case this week. Republican Glenn Youngkin made schools, and particularly parental control, his closing issue in his upset win over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. Between September and October polls, education rose 9 points to be the top issue for voters going into the race, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Parents who wanted more voice...
__label__5 Christie’s calculus: Trump is ‘in the rearview mirror’He doesn’t actually say the name Donald Trump when he lays out what’s wrong with the Republican Party. But it’s obvious who Chris Christie is talking about in recent speeches, interviews and in a new book that’s set for release next week. The former New Jersey governor has launched what amounts to a de facto exploratory bid for president, and it’s already put him on a collision course with his longtime political ally. While Christie’s criticism of the party’s focus on the 2020 election results and subtle knocks on other...
__label__3 Trump’s Bad NightOPINIONGlenn Youngkin did it his own way, barely mentioning the former president’s name, and still turned out MAGA voters in droves. November 2 was a boffo night for the Republican Party, and not such a great night for Donald Trump. It’s not as though the interests of the two are diametrically opposed, but they are in tension. To the extent that the GOP shows that it can thrive without former President Trump being on the ballot or even at the center of attention, it undermines the idea that he, and only...
__label__1 Glenn Youngkin targets education in Virginia Gov. race, says he'd ban CRTGlenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, has said he would ban critical race theory in schools on his first day in office. Youngkin made the pledge during a rally in Henrico on Saturday. His comments came during a section of his speech that focused on improvements to education he would implement if he were elected. "We all know education starts with curriculum," Youngkin told supporters at the rally. "So let me be clear: we will teach accelerated math, we will award advanced diplomas and we will teach all...
__label__5 Progressive coalition retools ahead of 2022OPINIONThe Center for Popular Democracy, a nationwide alliance of progressive groups, is retooling for the 2022 midterm cycle with a new leadership team and a pledge to spend more than $4 million on next year’s elections. Analilia Mejia, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ former national political director, and DaMareo Cooper, BlackPAC’s previous national organizing director, will be co-executive directors of the organization. Mejia and Cooper said their strategy to win Senate and gubernatorial races next year, which are expected to be an uphill climb for the Democratic Party, is to prioritize the progressive...
__label__2 House Republicans Inspired by Red Wave in VA, Target New House Seats for 2022: 'No Democrat Is Safe'In the wake of Republican Glenn Youngkin's stunning victory in Virginia and a much closer-than-expected gubernatorial race in New Jersey, a traditional Democratic stronghold, House Republicans sense opportunity and are setting an aggressive agenda for 2022.   On Wednesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which oversees House GOP campaigns, announced it will add 13 Democratic-held seats to its target list for 2022, bringing the total to 70. "In a cycle like this, no Democrat is safe," said NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN). Adding fuel to the fire, Tuesday's...
__label__2 Should there be special programs for gifted students?New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday announced a plan to gradually eliminate his city’s program for gifted and talented students in K-12 schools. Starting next fall, the nation’s largest school district will no longer admit incoming kindergartners into special gifted classes or schools. Instead, accelerated learning will be made accessible to all students in their own schools. The impending change comes after years of criticism of the racial makeup of students in the city’s gifted and talented program. About 75 percent of the 16,000 students in New York’s gifted...
__label__5 Two recounts appear likely in tight Virginia House racesDays after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts show Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by The Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are under 0.5%, which...

__label__2 Student Loan Forgiveness Won’t Be Available To These BorrowersStudent loan forgiveness won’t be available to these student loan borrowers. Here’s what you need to know. If there is more student loan forgiveness, it’s clear who it will help. Democrats in Congress and President Joe Biden agree that there should be wide-scale student loan forgiveness. However, they disagree on at least two points on student loan cancellation. First, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) want up to $50,000 of student loans cancelled, Biden wants up to $10,000 of student loans forgiven. Second, Warren...
__label__5 Republican wave builds to take back the HouseRepublicans could hardly be better poised to recapture the House majority. Increasingly aggressive redistricting, a diverse slate of candidates raking in record-breaking amounts of cash and a political atmosphere that just keeps getting more favorable has Democrats watching with a growing sense of dread. Last week alone, the GOP saw the stirrings of a full-fledged suburban revival from Virginia to New Jersey to New York — and also possibly ended the careers of as many five Democratic incumbents with punishing new congressional maps in three other states. Republicans were plotting to cement...
__label__3 Republicans Primed To ‘Comfortably Take Back’ Congress In 2022 After Democrats’ Election DisasterRepublicans’ routing of Democrats in Virginia and their strong showing in New Jersey on Tuesday night may signal a GOP takeover of Congress next year. In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin knocked off Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor, upsetting the former governor of Virginia who was an early favorite to retake the office. Youngkin’s victory was joined by Republican Winsome Sears, who defeated Democrat Hala Ayala for lieutenant governor, and Republican Jason Miyares, who upset incumbent Democrat Mark Herring for attorney general. In New Jersey, GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is running neck-and-neck with Democratic...
__label__2 Biden plan seeks to expand education, from pre-K to collegeAs Democrats push ahead with President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion rebuilding plan, they’re promising historic investments across the arc of an education — from early childhood to college and beyond — in what advocates describe as the most comprehensive package of its kind in decades. The education provisions in Biden’s “Build Back Better” proposal would serve as a bedrock for schooling opportunities for countless Americans and test the nation’s willingness to expand federal programs in far-reaching ways. Equity is a focus, as it seeks to remove barriers to education that for decades have...
__label__5 Column: Biden’s in deep trouble. He can still bounce backOPINIONWhen Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he had all the advantages of a nonincumbent in a year when everything had gone wrong. Biden waged a careful, disciplined campaign, built around a simple message: He would end the pandemic, rebuild the economy and restore normalcy. After the chaos of the Trump years, that was enough. Governing has been more difficult. The pandemic, fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, didn’t end. The economy’s recovery has come with worrisome inflation, shortages and supply chain problems. In public opinion polls,...
__label__3 CNN's Van Jones, David Axelrod rip fellow Democrats as 'annoying and offensive,' 'out of touch,' 'moralizing' amid big election night lossAmid the shocking political turnaround in Virginia that culminated with Republican Glenn Youngkin's defeat of far-left Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor Tuesday night, CNN's Van Jones and David Axelrod reflected on how their own Democratic Party managed to lose so big in a blue state. 'Annoying and offensive' Jones surmised that Democrats have been living in a political bubble and not paying attention to voters' real day-to-day needs — and paid for it at the ballot box. "I think that the Democrats are coming across in ways that we don't recognize that...
__label__2 Can there be a winner in the school culture wars?ANALYSISIn a typical back-to-school season, markers and poster board might be on a classroom supply list. This year, they’re also hot items for protesters attending their local school board meetings.  Mask mandates, critical race theory, “you name the issue and people want to speak out,” says Heath Miller, a high school band director in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who considers this the most stressful period of his 20 years teaching. In recent weeks, individuals in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, lit masks on fire outside a school board meeting. Pro-mask protesters in Fort Worth, Texas, staged a mock...
__label__5 Murphy Narrowly Wins Re-election as New Jersey GovernorPhilip D. Murphy, a New Jersey Democrat whose aggressive approach to controlling the pandemic became a focal point of the bid to unseat him, narrowly held onto the governor’s office in an unexpectedly close election that highlighted stark divisions over mask and vaccine mandates, even in a liberal-leaning state. With roughly 90 percent of the vote tallied, Mr. Murphy was ahead of his Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, by less than 1 percentage point when The Associated Press called the race just before 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday after a protracted count....
__label__3 Youngkin Defeats McAuliffe, Wins Virginia In Decisive Referendum On The Left’s Culture WarOPINIONRepublican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday to become the next governor of Virginia. The race is widely seen as a bellwether for far-left Democrat policy priorities, specifically the party’s radical positions on education. Those include COVID school closures, critical race theory, targeting parents who speak out against school boards, and — in Virginia’s Loudoun County — covering up alleged incidents of sexual assault that cast doubt on transgender policies. Youngkin gave a victory speech to his supporters in Chantilly in the early hours of the morning, promising...
__label__2 Taliban: Women can study in gender-segregated universitiesWomen in Afghanistan can continue to study in universities, including at post-graduate levels, but classrooms will be gender-segregated and Islamic dress is compulsory, the Taliban government’s new higher education minister said Sunday. The announcement came as a Taliban official said Qatar’s foreign minister arrived in the Afghan capital of Kabul — the highest level visitor since the Taliban announced their interim Cabinet. There was no immediate confirmation of the visit by Qatari officials. Earlier Sunday, the higher education minister, Abdul Baqi Haqqani, laid out the new policies at a news...
__label__5 Progressives bare teeth after election debacleProgressives are over it. Minutes after networks declared Republican Glenn Youngkin the winner of Virginia’s gubernatorial race, strategists, activists and outside groups in the Democratic Party’s left wing began firing the first shots in the intraparty war over who is at fault for Tuesday’s shellacking. Their message: Blame the moderates in charge, not us. Their emboldened stance in the wake of the devastating loss for Democrats in Virginia, as well as setbacks in New Jersey, Minneapolis and Buffalo, N.Y., suggests that progressives will not change course ahead of the 2022 midterms...
__label__3 Seven Take-Aways From 'Blood Bath' GOP Victories Last NightANALYSISWell, it happened.  After witnessing the party get shut out of statewide races for the last dozen years, the 2021 Virginia GOP ticket swept all three major races on Tuesday, flipping a state that voted for Joe Biden by ten percentage points just one year ago.  Any way you slice it, this is an incredible feat.  In my predictions post yesterday, I offered the following analysis, which I believe has aged rather well:  This race is a home game for McAuliffe. The fundamentals of the new Virginia electorate favor him and his party. On...

The e-commerce giant joins other retailers, restaurant chains, garbage haulers and meat processors dangling the prospect of a free college education as a way to lure and retain staff in a tight U.S. job market. Amazon said Thursday that it will cover the cost of tuition and books for staff pursuing bachelor’s degrees at various universities nationwide. Hourly employees will be eligible for the new perk after 90 days...
__label__5 Democrats Face Economic Gut-Check After GOP Taps Voters’ AngstANALYSISDemocrats will argue for months about what led to their defeat at the ballot box on Tuesday -- whether it was their messaging, their candidates or their president. But there was consensus that the first step is to get something done on economic issues. One day after an embarrassing loss in the Virginia gubernatorial election and a dispiritingly tight race in New Jersey, Democrats from President Joe Biden to moderate and progressive members of Congress cast passage of his infrastructure and $1.75 trillion social spending package as a panacea for...
__label__3 Mayoral Candidates Turn Backs To Black Lives Matter Movement, Promise ‘Law And Order’Candidates running in Tuesday’s mayoral elections across the U.S. have promised to “crackdown” on crime in the aftermath of violent crime surges that swept through major American cities. Candidates, including Democrats, have stepped away from the Black Lives Matter movement’s calls to defund police departments in response to the death of George Floyd, as crime has risen in cities and the public demands for traditional policing strategies, according to the Washington Post. A Tuesday Pew Research poll revealed that 47% of Americans want to increase funding toward police departments, while 15% want to decrease funds....
__label__1 Parents are desperate for actually useful information about Covid and schools. Local news isn’t really helping.Parents around the country are freaking out and holding their collective breath as a new school year begins. My kid has been back at in-person school for about a month, and we’ve been averaging about two robocalls a week about new cases of Covid at school. What’s worse, the school district’s Covid plans, 20 months into the pandemic, seem to be another fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants affair. Our school didn’t post its Covid protocols on its website until three weeks after classes started. Quarantine criteria are opaque, and what you do catch in tidbits from...
__label__5 Republicans Once Supported the Voting Rights Act. Today, They Voted Against its Restoration.ANALYSISOn Wednesday afternoon, GOP senators blocked Democrats from advancing a key voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, marking the second time in two weeks and the fourth time this year that Republicans have filibustered voting rights legislation that would combat GOP voter suppression efforts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it a “low, low point in the history of this body.” Republicans have now prevented three different voting rights bills introduced by Democrats from reaching the Senate floor. This repeated obstruction is likely to embolden top...

In the freest nation in the world, our system of government and our very liberty depend on free and fair elections. Whether selecting a mayor or the president of the United States, every American must be able to trust the process, or the democratic system itself breaks down. When someone commits election fraud, the process is no longer fair, everyone’s vote gets diluted, and in some cases, election results are changed. Problems can arise not only from intentional misconduct...

__label__3 Election 2021: Virginia's in the spotlight, but here are the other races to watchVirginia's deadlocked gubernatorial battle between former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin is firmly in the national spotlight. The commonwealth, a onetime general election battleground that’s still very competitive between the two major parties, is one of only two states that hold races for governor in the year after a presidential election, guaranteeing outsized attention from coast to coast. And the state’s gubernatorial contest is seen as a key barometer ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when the Democrats will be defending their razor-thin margins in both the House of Representatives and...

The Taliban — who until losing power 20 years ago barred nearly all girls and women from attending school and doled out harsh punishment to those who defied them — are back in control. Like many women, I fear for my Afghan sisters. I cannot help but think of my own childhood. When the Taliban took over my hometown in Pakistan’s Swat Valley in 2007 and...
__label__5 What Glenn Youngkin’s Virginia win means for DemocratsOPINIONAfter a string of election victories in Virginia, Democrats thought the state had turned blue, but Republican Glenn Youngkin has won this year’s governor’s contest, defeating former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and delivering the state back into the GOP’s hands. Media outlets called the race for Youngkin early Wednesday morning. The final margin isn’t yet clear, but no matter what, it represents a major swing of Virginia voters toward Republicans that will strike fear into Democrats’ hearts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. In 2017, Democrats won the governor’s race by 9...

Pollsters asked Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents if they thought “Democrats have a better chance of winning the presidency in 2024 if Joe Biden is the party’s nominee, or if someone else is the party’s nominee?” Forty-four percent of respondents said they thought Democrats had a better shot at winning if Biden is replaced, while 36 percent said...

But even as Democrats were processing a battering in the Virginia governor’s race and the uncomfortably close gubernatorial election in New Jersey, the White House and officials across the party pledged to forge ahead with the twin pillars of the president’s domestic agenda. Several made the case that Tuesday’s results only added to the pressure for them to do so. “We have to show we can govern,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), citing a recent breakthrough in talks to...

The basis for this claim is Youngkin’s criticism of McAuliffe’s veto of two bills that would have allowed parents to opt their children out of reading texts that contain sexual material.

The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona. It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden’s Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes.

The benefits cannot be overstated: Cheap, reliable energy is key to economic growth and broad-based prosperity. Yet Biden has squandered this advantage. Retail gas prices are up 55.95% from last year, with California gas prices hitting nearly $8 a gallon . This has hit pocketbooks directly through costs to keep the lights and heat on in homes, and indirectly through rising prices for all sorts of goods, the production and transportation of which require the use of more expensive...

According to an article in the November 2, 2021, Wall Street Journal, Biden’s EPA will soon issue regulations requiring that all associated natural gas released in conjunction with oil production be put in pipelines for delivery to market. The destructive impact of the proposed new regulations cannot be overstated. Oil producers already put associated natural gas in pipelines wherever they are available. The problem is that they are not always available. For example, they are never available offshore or in regions that are new...

__label__1 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...
__label__4 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...
__label__3 What to Do about the Left’s Empty EnvironmentalismOPINIONPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and other world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Recep Erdogan are gating in Scotland for a climate summit. You know, the usual thing. Once again, we are at a “moment of truth” and taking our “last best chance” to save the blah blah blah, you’ve heard it all before. The results are surely going to be unenforceable, meaningless, or poorly understood goals. Maybe China will pretend to comply with them. Maybe it won’t bother. World leaders will be scowled at by neurodivergent children....
__label__1 Democrats’ big problem: How to win without Trump to run againstIn the Virginia elections, as well as nationally, we look at the role of negative partisanship. It’s when voters are more motivated by what they dislike in an opponent, than by what they like in their own candidate. Democrats had some blockbuster years in Virginia during Donald Trump’s presidency.  In 2017, Ralph Northam won the governorship by almost 9 points, more than tripling former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s margin from four years earlier. Democrats flipped three of the state’s 11 congressional seats in 2018, and in 2019 took control of the...
__label__4 How you could see cleaner air and water with Biden’s new infrastructure lawANALYSISPresident Joe Biden signed into law on Monday a bipartisan infrastructure bill that includes $350 billion to address long-ignored environmental threats. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the largest sum in recent memory directed at cleaning up pollution, from replacing lead pipes to capping methane-spewing oil wells. The funding could make a serious dent in air and water pollution for certain communities by preventing runoff from abandoned mines and cleaning up old, toxic manufacturing sites. People who live near busy roadways, airports, and ports may benefit from the boost to electric vehicle charging stations,...
__label__3 Amid soaring gas prices, Democrats target oil CEOs for alleged climate liesGasoline prices at the pump are at the highest level since 2014, while the price for heating homes is projected to increase by double digits this winter. But House Democrats are focusing on what oil executives said decades ago about global warming. On Thursday, CEOs of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell will be on Capitol Hill to face a grilling about whether they deceived the public on climate perils, as the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on the Environment holds a hearing titled, "Fueling the Climate Crisis: Exposing Big Oil’s Disinformation Campaign to...
__label__1 Why education was a top voter priority this electionIt touches most every household in the United States, whether as taxpayers or as parents, but come Election Day, education rarely makes it to the top of voter priorities. That wasn't the case this week. Republican Glenn Youngkin made schools, and particularly parental control, his closing issue in his upset win over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. Between September and October polls, education rose 9 points to be the top issue for voters going into the race, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Parents who wanted more voice...
__label__4 What the world did and didn’t accomplish at COP26OPINIONThe high-stakes COP26 climate change talks in Glasgow concluded on Saturday evening with the strongest government commitments to fighting climate change in history. Yet they’re still not enough to meet the ambitious targets of the Paris climate agreement and stave off some of the worst consequences of global warming. It was not the massive course correction for the climate that activists — some of whom staged a “die-in” outside the COP26 venue — were clamoring for. “I hope you can appreciate that where I live, a 2 degree [Celsius warmer]...
__label__3 New Zealand Becomes First Country in the World to Pass Climate Change Disclosure LawNew Zealand has become the first country in the world to pass a law ensuring financial organizations disclose and act on climate-related risks and opportunities, the government announced on Thursday. The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Bill passed its third reading with the goal of driving New Zealand’s push toward carbon neutrality by 2050. In a statement, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister David Clark and Climate Change Minister James Shaw said the bill was one of several actions New Zealand’s government is taking to meet its international obligations in achieving the carbon...
__label__1 Voters punish Democrats amid left driftANALYSISFrom Virginia to New Jersey to Minnesota, voters in yesterday's off-year elections sent Democrats a warning for 2022: There could be a massive backlash to perceptions that progressives are pulling the party too far left. Why it matters: Now the finger-pointing begins. President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can use the wake-up call to try to force a reset, starting with swift passage of a long-stalled $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. But the same GOP gains that narrowed Dems' margins or flipped advantages in some swing...
__label__4 Leaders at COP26 Are 'Massively Killing the Paris Agreement,' Critics Say as Talks Drag On Past DeadlineAfter nearly two weeks of negotiations, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland was expected to extend into the weekend Friday as policymakers missed the evening deadline for finalizing their deal on how countries will combat the climate crisis—with leaders unable to come to an agreement thus far regarding financial support for the Global South, fossil fuel subsidies, and other key issues. Hundreds of campaigners representing Indigenous communities, young people, and civil society groups poured into the hallways of the venue where COP26 is taking place, chanting, "Keep...
__label__3 Climate backfire: Coal-fired power jumps as natural gas prices soarCoal-fired electricity generation climbed this year in the U.S. for the first time since the Obama administration, spurred by spiking natural gas prices, a setback for the Biden climate agenda and a sign that the president’s drilling crackdown may be backfiring. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday that electricity generated by coal-fired plants is expected to jump by 22% in 2021 over last year’s levels for the first year-over-year increase since 2014. The reason: the rising cost of natural gas, which began climbing in April and hit a 13-year...
__label__2 In heavily Democratic New Jersey, the governor race is surprisingly closeWhile Democrats were bracing for an upset in Virginia, perhaps the biggest shock out of Tuesday's election was a tight race for governor of deep-blue New Jersey. For months, polls have shown that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy had a comfortable lead — as much as 11 points according to a Monmouth University poll released last week — over Republican Jack Ciattarelli. But the race is too close to call and it could take a week to count mailed ballots. Either campaign can request a recount. Even though Jack Ciattarelli ran in the 2017 Republican primary...
__label__5 Countries’ climate pledges built on flawed data, Post investigation findsMalaysia’s latest catalogue of its greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations reads like a report from a parallel universe. The 285-page document suggests that Malaysia’s trees are absorbing carbon four times faster than similar forests in neighboring Indonesia. The surprising claim has allowed the country to subtract over 243 million tons of carbon dioxide from its 2016 inventory — slashing 73 percent of emissions from its bottom line. Across the world, many countries underreport their greenhouse gas emissions in their reports to the United Nations, a Washington Post investigation has found. An examination of...
__label__3 Cargo ship near California pipeline made strange movements: reportA massive cargo ship made a series of unusual movements while anchored in the closest spot to a Southern California oil pipeline that ruptured and sent crude washing up on beaches, according to data collected by a marine navigation service.The Coast Guard is investigating whether a ship anchor might have snagged and bent the pipeline owned by Amplify Energy, a Houston-based company that operates three offshore oil platforms south of Los Angeles.
__label__1 Fact Checking Donald Trump’s WSJ Letter to the EditorFACT CHECKOn October 27, the Wall Street Journal published a letter to the editor from Donald Trump, responding to “Pennsylvania’s 2020 Election.” In it, Trump maintains that the 2020 election was “rigged.” The former president recycled familiar—and previously debunked—voter fraud claims to make his case. In total, Trump makes 20 allegations of voter fraud, but the basis for most of these claims are not immediately clear.  First, Trump claims that in Pennsylvania “71,893 mail-in ballots were returned after Nov. 3, 2020, at 8 p.m.” He adds: “[N]one of these should have been counted according to...
__label__5 Fossil Fuel Lobbyists Have Larger Presence at COP26 Than Any Single Country: ReportA coalition of watchdog groups estimated Monday that fossil fuel industry representatives have a larger presence at COP26 than officials from any single country, a finding that further intensified environmentalists' concerns about the legitimacy of the high-stakes climate summit. After pouring over a 1,600-page United Nations list of approved COP26 attendees, the coalition led by Global Witness published an analysis showing that at least 503 fossil fuel lobbyists have been admitted to the summit in Glasgow, Scotland. That means the oil and gas industry—the principal driver of the crisis that COP26 was ostensibly convened to tackle—unofficially has...
__label__3 ‘Not Refugees’: Polish Government Fact-Checks CNN on Belarus-Engineered Migrant CrisisANALYSISPoland’s national-conservative government has fact-checked CNN on the migrant crisis engineered on the European Union’s eastern border by Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman for the Minister-Coordinator of Special Services at National Security Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, admonished CNN after it published an article on the ongoing border crisis, which has seen mostly Middle Eastern and South Asian migrants clashing with Polish border guards, police officers, and soldiers manning the frontier. The American news outlet, Żaryn alleged, had “missed the point” by characterising the situation as one in which...
__label__2 We’re Tracking Trump’s And Harris’s Popularity Ahead Of The 2024 Presidential Election. (Yes, It’s Early.)ANALYSISFormer President Donald Trump ended his presidency more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. Overall, Trump’s unfavorability — now that he’s out of office we’re tracking his favorability numbers rather than his approval rating, both of which capture popularity — has remained steady just as his low approval...
__label__5 Why some experts say corporate 'net-zero' emissions pledges could have net-zero impact on climate crisisDubbed a "code red for humanity" by the head of the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its most-recent report that the impacts of human-induced climate change are already being seen in "every region across the globe" and urgent action must be taken immediately, not decades into the future, to mitigate the devastation. As scientists sound the alarms, it has become near-impossible for business leaders to ignore the research -- or the global, youth-led protests spurred by activists like Greta Thunberg, who view climate change as an intergenerational justice issue -- as...
__label__3 Joe Biden ‘Got a Handle on COVID’OPINIONCLAIM: "Biden got a handle on COVID." — David Corn, D.C. bureau chief of Mother Jones The lib reporter made the assertion on Twitter in response to complaints from Democrats about President Joe Biden's lack of meaningful accomplishments, including his failure to criminally prosecute Donald Trump. VERDICT: WTF is he talking about? As of this week, almost 350,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Biden's watch at an average rate of 1,172 per day. That is more than the combined total of American combat deaths in the First and Second World Wars. It is the...
__label__1 Women are our climate leaders, but at COP26 they're struggling to be heardANALYSISOn the final day of the United Nation's COP26 climate summit, delegates who identify as part of the climate justice movement staged a massive walkout. At a prearranged moment, people from nongovernmental organizations and other civil society groups left the plenary hall and joined protestors on the far side of the eight-foot high fences surrounding the summit, chanting, "The people united will never be defeated." Here, from a makeshift stage, speakers (delegates and non-delegates alike) addressed the crowds of people in the wind and rain, many of whom had chosen to come and listen...
__label__5 Biden to Unleash 'Irrevocable Climate Chaos' if US Fracked Gas Export Projects Proceed: Groups"Would climate leaders build 399 new coal plants in the U.S.?" So asks an advertisement placed in Scotland's largest daily newspaper this week by U.S. environmental and climate justice groups during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, part of an effort to persuade the Biden administration to reject all new gas exports and fossil fuel infrastructure. "The answer is no," the ad says. "Yet right now, 23 liquefied natural gas export terminals and pipelines are sitting on your desks. These projects will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to doubling all existing...
__label__3 Democrat Cindy Axne Falsely Claims Biden’s $1.75T Agenda Will Cost Iowans ‘Literally Nothing’ANALYSISCLAIM: Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne (D-IA) claimed last week that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will cost Iowans “literally nothing.” VERDICT: False. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will stick Americans with trillions more in debt. “This cost Iowans literally nothing,” Rep. Axne said of the far-left’s agenda during an interview on Let’s Talk Guthrie County. “If you’re making under $400,000, you know what you’re going to get? A tax break. Because this bill is literally the first time in a long time that we’ve had a substantial approach to helping working...
__label__2 The future of the big new climate coalitionsSome of the most headline-grabbing initiatives to emerge from COP26 come with big questions about how — and if — they'll make the journey from promises to reality. Driving the news: COP26 brought the arrival or expansion of coalitions of nations making voluntary pledges around phasing out coal, cutting methane emissions, electric car growth, ending deforestation, curbing overseas fossil fuel finance and plenty more. While many of the biggest fossil fuel producers and users are missing from the deals, these ad-hoc agreements are still significant — if implemented. Yes, but: They're outside the official Paris agreement process, which requires formal,...
__label__5 Scotland's 'Sphinx' snow patch melts away for only eighth time in 300 yearsThe United Kingdom's longest-lasting patch of snow, located in a remote mountain range in the Scottish Highlands, has melted away for only the eighth time in 300 years, experts have confirmed. The snow patch, nicknamed the Sphinx, is the U.K.'s most durable, which means it typically stays frozen through the summer, even after most snow has melted across the region's upland terrain. The rare disappearance of the patch comes as Scotland plays host to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, during which government officials from around the world...
__label__3 For Whom Do the Covid “Fact Checkers” Really Work?OPINIONThere are two types of COVID19 survivors— those who have documented recovery from sars-cov-2 (either PCR, antigen or serology + tests) or those who have self-identified recovery from sars-cov 2 (said they had it). When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...
__label__1 U.S. and China unveil deal to ramp up cooperation on climate changeThe United States and China, the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, unveiled a deal to ramp up cooperation tackling climate change, including by reducing methane emissions, protecting forests and phasing out coal. The framework agreement was announced by U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the U.N. climate conference in Scotland, and was billed by both as way to tip the summit toward success. read more "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elements which will promote ambition," Kerry told a...
__label__4 Biden heads into international climate negotiations with a weak handOPINIONOn the opening day of the 26th international climate conference in Glasgow, President Joe Biden’s pitch to the world was, more or less, to trust that the US would lead on the climate crisis. Biden originally hoped to arrive in Scotland with a pair of laws in hand that marked the US’s most significant investment ever in the climate crisis. Instead, he brought a smattering of executive actions and pledges, while his main agenda remains a moving target in Congress. It’s almost exactly a year since the Trump administration officially, though...
__label__3 Beware People Trying to Dismiss Jack Dorsey's Inflation Analysis as DisinformationANALYSISI hope you squirreled away that cool 16 cents you saved on your Fourth of July barbeque this year. Across the board, prices seem to be going up, up, up. Gas is more expensive (up 42.7 percent). Cars and trucks, too (up 7.6 percent for new and 31.9 percent (!) for used). Your wallet is surely feeling the burn at the grocery store (up 3 percent). Meat, in particular, is getting really expensive (up 10.5 percent), to the sure delight of the anti-animal food crusaders out there. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official measure of...
__label__1 World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - reportDespite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows. It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to. COP26 "has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change. But the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements...
__label__4 Big Oil Climate Denial Hearing Features Even More DenialA landmark congressional hearing to probe the extent to which the oil industry misled the public about global climate change featured executives of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies and industry trade groups further downplaying climate science. “We know the combustion of oil and gas releases greenhouse gases,” Darren Woods, CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil, told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform before misrepresenting the findings of the world’s leading climate science body. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he said, “has concluded that increased greenhouse...
__label__3 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__2 The magic 1.5: What’s behind climate talks’ key elusive goalANALYSISOne phrase, really just a number, dominates climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland: The magic and elusive 1.5. That stands for the international goal of trying to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s a somewhat confusing number in some ways that wasn’t a major part of negotiations just seven years ago and was a political suggestion that later proved to be incredibly important scientifically. Stopping warming at 1.5 or so can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms...
__label__5 China at COP26: Beijing's coal addiction is key to climate summitChina is a country of epic contradictions. It is home to the world’s largest solar farm, a rolling ocean of 4 million panels high up in the Tibetan plateau that’s large enough to cover Manhattan. Some 600 miles to the east, in Inner Mongolia, are the belching smokestacks of the Tuoketuo power plant, the world's largest coal-fired power station and one of the biggest single sources of pollution ever created. On Sunday, at the start of COP26, the world may get a clue as to which of China’s two extremes will dominate the coming decades —...
__label__3 Washington Post fact-checker calls asking about Biden visiting the border 'a bit of a gotcha question'Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler seemed to dismiss the ongoing inquires of whether or not President Biden has gone to the southern border and if he has any intention of visiting in the future.  Biden raised eyebrows on Thursday at CNN's town hall when he was asked by an attendee why he hadn't been to the southern border as president.  He responded by saying he had "been there before" but admitted "I guess I should go down" before pointing to his busy schedule that has prevented the visit and touting a trip to the border...
__label__2 To fight climate change, Ithaca votes to decarbonize its buildings by 2030In a groundbreaking move this week, the city of Ithaca, New York, voted to decarbonize and electrify buildings in the city by the end of the decade — a goal that was part of the city's own Green New Deal and one of the portions of the plan that will help the city become carbon neutral by 2030. Ithaca is the first U.S. city to establish such a plan, which the city says will cut Ithaca's 400,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions by 40%. The timeline to achieve its goal is much...
__label__5 In Germany, global warming is changing more than just the climate. It’s changing politics, too.Layers of dried mud on sidewalks, concrete roads turned to gravel and time-worn stone bridges washed away. Three months after this summer’s catastrophic floods in Germany’s Ahrweiler region, there are reminders everywhere of the destruction they wrought. The deluge, which was preceded by three consecutive summers of drought, has brought a new urgency for many to find climate change solutions — and that has impacted Germany’s politics, too. In last month’s federal election, the environmentalist Green Party had its best results yet, winning nearly 15 percent of the vote, and trailing just behind the two largest parties....
__label__3 CNN Fact Checks Biden’s Town Hall But Neglects Claim That Multi-Trillion-Dollar Agenda Will Cost $0President Joe Biden made some false claims at his town hall with moderator Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, prompting the CNN Newsroom to fact check a few of his statements. Responding to concerns about the southern border Biden stated, “I’ve been there before. I know it well.”  Later, he conceded, “I guess I should go down but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole lot of time to get down.”   CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pushed back against this claim, stating that he “could not find any...
__label__2 Climate summit: The key is momentum, even if progress is slowThe COP26 climate summit may make no breakthroughs, but global public opinion is demanding a behavior change that technology now permits. That will make itself felt after the meeting. There are two ways of looking at the crucial climate change conference currently underway in Glasgow, Scotland. Through the narrow lens of politics – gauging the prospects of a landmark deal to make good on the unfulfilled promise of the 2015 Paris Agreement – the picture looks distinctly unpromising. Even the summit host, the habitually bullish British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,...
__label__5 'Deluge' in a drought: Millions of Californians warned of flash flooding risk on SundayDrought-stricken regions of Northern California could see "excessive rainfall" — as much as 8-10 inches of rain — when an extreme weather system hits the West Coast this weekend, the National Weather Center warns. Millions of people in Northern California were at some risk for flash floods on Sunday due to the system, known as an "atmospheric river," the Weather Prediction Center said Saturday. Meanwhile, residents of a small swathe of coastal Santa Barbara County were told to evacuate Friday due to mudslide concerns. The weather system is expected to begin hitting the coast on Saturday night....
__label__3 CNN Forced to Fact Check Joe Biden's CNN Town HallANALYSISOn Thursday night amid multiple crises of his administration's creation, President Joe Biden joined CNN for a town hall event hosted by Anderson Cooper and it went about as well as you could expect for a septuagenarian up past his bed time.  The morning after Biden and Cooper's conversation, though, CNN itself published a fact check of what Biden claimed on the stage in Baltimore. When asked about the U.S.-Mexico border — at which an unmitigated illegal immigration crisis is raging — the president said "I've been there before, and...
__label__1 Saving the Amazon, one wood-carved spoon at a timePledges at global conferences such as COP26 to halt deforestation are all well and good. But they are worthless unless they translate into ground-level action like this venture. Jackeane dos Santos Leite leans over a thin plank of wood, her brow furrowed above her plastic goggles. Carefully, she traces the shape of a spatula before powering up a small electric saw. “I’ve only used this one a few times,” she says through the cloud of sawdust, her hands unsteady as she cuts into the tauari, or Brazilian oak wood. “The shape...
__label__5 The fate of the planet will be negotiated in Glasgow, ScotlandOPINIONAlmost every country in the world signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a monumental accord that aimed to limit global warming. But it was forged on a contradiction: Every signatory agreed that everyone must do something to address the urgent threat of climate change, but no one at the time pledged to do enough. In the years since the agreement, the emissions that trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere have continued to rise. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius, compared to temperatures...
__label__3 Yes, Biden Is Proposing That the IRS Spy on Your Bank RecordsOPINIONHere’s yet another example of why “fact-checking” is the most dishonest form of journalism. To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...

The Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use also includes Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and its signatories account for about 85% of the world's forests. The agreement aims to conserve and accelerate restoration of forests and to significantly increase finance and investment to promote sustainable forest management, conservation and support for Indigenous and local communities. Politicians praised...
__label__5 ‘No more time to waste,’ chair of House climate panel warns ahead of Cop26The alarm bells are ringing. A code red has been declared. With no less than the future of the planet at stake, Kathy Castor, chair of the select committee on the climate crisis, has warned Democrats that there is precious little time left to enact the US president’s aggressive climate agenda and avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. “We just don’t have any more time to waste,” the Florida congresswoman said in an interview with the Guardian ahead of crucial UN climate talks in Scotland. “We have got to act now or...

This week, we examine calls for the mainstream media to be more critical of Republicans, analyze the media’s coverage of the death of Colin Powell, and highlight more media misses. Journalists are Telling on Themselves Reporters from several mainstream-media outlets outed themselves as biased conduits of information over the weekend when they excitedly promoted a Los Angeles Times column that argued journalists are “failing the public with ‘both-siderism’ in political coverage.” Columnist Jackie Calmes laments how “journalist pressure” to be balanced...
__label__1 COP26: US to tackle methane leaks from oil and gas wellsThe US is set to announce measures to prevent millions of tonnes of the greenhouse gas methane from entering the atmosphere. The measures will target methane leaking from oil and gas rigs across the US. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities. A global partnership to cut methane is to be announced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on Tuesday. Dozens of countries have joined the initiative led by the US and the EU to cut...
__label__4 Money For Green Energy Creates More Jobs Than Fossil Fuel Investment, New Study FindsAs Congress debates whether to pare down the Biden administration’s signature climate proposals or allow the fossil fuel industry to benefit more from new government programs, new research suggests doing so would create far fewer jobs. For every million dollars the United States government invests, solar produces over 2.7 times more jobs than fossil fuels, according to an analysis from two environmental think tanks and a labor union. Wind energy spurs over 2.8 times more jobs than investments in oil, gas and coal. And retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient creates demand for...
__label__3 The New York Times Spreads Misinformation About COVID-19ANALYSISThe purported threat of social media has emerged once again as a top concern of senators, whistleblowers, and members of the press. They are very, very worried about Facebook fanning the flames of hate, compromising U.S. democracy, and spreading COVID misinformation. How many of them are worried about the COVID misinformation being spread by The New York Times? The paper of record had to print a lengthy correction to a big error in a Thursday news article. The story was about other countries' approaches to vaccinating young people, and whether one shot would be better than...
__label__1 U.S. climate credibility on the line as Biden heads to COP26President Joe Biden wants to show the U.N. climate conference in Scotland that the United States is back in the fight against global warming. But continued haggling in Congress over legislation to advance his climate goals threatens to undermine that message on the world stage. Biden leaves for Europe on Thursday for a G20 meeting in Rome followed by a gathering of world leaders in Glasgow aimed at saving the planet from the devastation wreaked by rising temperatures. Biden had hoped to showcase legislation designed to fulfill a U.S. pledge...

The popular surf spot reopened Monday after city officials and California State Parks announced in a statement that “water quality testing results showed non-detectable amounts of oil associated toxins in our ocean water.” As my colleague Piper McDaniel reported last week, the ocean floor accident has exposed a complicated web of responsibility: An estimated 144,000 gallons of oil gushed into the sea over the weekend before Amplify Energy Corp., owner of the ruptured pipeline, shut...

Zero. Zero,” Biden insisted during an appearance in Michigan on Tuesday in a speech promoting his infrastructure bill and his “Build Back Better” entitlement spending proposal. The president repeated his widely-mocked “zero” cost talking point, even though fact checkers from the establishment media have called him out on the dubious claim. Even the Washington Post‘s Glenn Kessler gave Biden “Two Pinocchios”...
__label__2 UN emissions gap report a 'thundering wake-up call'National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. Their Emissions Gap report says country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. Just a few days before COP26 opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is "another thundering wake-up...
__label__5 Major Climate Action at Stake in Fight Over Twin Bills Pending in CongressPresident Biden has framed this moment as the country’s best chance to save the planet. “The nation and the world are in peril,” he said weeks ago in Queens, where 11 people drowned in their basement apartments after floodwaters from Hurricane Ida devastated communities from Louisiana to New York. “And that’s not hyperbole. That is a fact. They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living in it real time now.” Mr. Biden’s plan to try to fortify the United States against extreme weather — and...
__label__2 Psaki Says Trump Was Silent on Human Rights Abuses in ChinaANALYSISCLAIM: President Joe Biden, unlike President Donald Trump, has spoken out against human rights abuses in China. VERDICT: FALSE. The Trump administration accused China of genocide; meanwhile, Biden has been soft on China. White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed Wednesday that President Biden had spoken out against human rights abuses in China — whereas, she said, President Trump did not. In response to a question about whether the Biden administration was overlooking China’s genocide of Uighur Muslims as it sought cooperation with the communist government on climate change, Psaki...
__label__1 Does nuclear power have a place in a green-energy future?Countries around the world have set ambitious goals to fight climate change by drastically reducing their emissions in the coming decades. Doing so means replacing carbon-heavy power sources, like coal and gas, with green-energy solutions. Renewables like solar, wind and hydroelectric power will certainly play a major role. But environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers are divided on whether or not nuclear power should be part of a clean-energy future. In the 1980s, nuclear power provided about 17 percent of the world’s energy. But high-profile disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl led many countries to stop investing...

__label__3 Public Health Officials Blew Up Their Credibility, and We're Paying the PriceOPINIONWith COVID-19 still sickening and killing people even though effective vaccines have been widely available for all since the spring, it's frustrating to see vaccination rates creep up only slowly against a head-wind of widespread resistance. It's even more frustrating that much of that resistance can be attributed to self-inflicted wounds on the part of public health experts and government officials. Having effectively discarded their own credibility since the beginning of the pandemic, the powers-that-be find that much of the population no longer places faith in what they have to say. "Why...
__label__2 In New Mexico, a wildlife refuge with urban rootsFrom her office in the visitor center at the still-under-construction Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, Jennifer Owen-White has a perfect view of the fuel terminals and salvage yards that dot the horizon.  One day soon, there will be wetlands, trails, and saltgrass meadows in the foreground. But those fuel tanks and junked cars will still loom like a storm cloud in the distance, an “important reminder,” says Ms. Owen-White, of “what my job is and why this refuge exists.” Valle de Oro represents something of a new dawn for...
__label__4 ‘Eco’ wood stoves emit 750 times more pollution than an HGV, study showsNew wood burning stoves billed as more environmentally friendly still emit 750 times more tiny particle pollution than a modern HGV truck, a report has shown. Only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold from the start of 2022 in the UK and EU, but experts said the regulation was shockingly weak. The report used data on the emissions produced by stoves in perfect laboratory conditions and the pollution could be even higher in everyday use, the researchers said, with older stoves being much worse. Tiny particle...
__label__3 Facebook Smeared Me With Its ‘Fact-Checking.’ Now, I’m Suing the Tech Giant.OPINIONI just sued Facebook. I didn’t want to sue. I hate lawsuits. I tried for a year to reach someone at Facebook to fix things, but Facebook wouldn’t. Here’s the problem: Facebook uses “independent fact-checkers” to try to reduce fake news on its site. That’s a noble goal. Unfortunately, at least one Facebook “fact-checker” is a climate-alarmist group that cleverly uses its Facebook connections to stop debate. Facebook is a private company. It has every right to cut me off. But Facebook does not have the right to just lie...
__label__2 COP26: Document leak reveals nations lobbying to change key climate reportA huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change. The leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. It also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. This "lobbying" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November.

__label__4 Maricopa County Audit Did Not Find 712,152 New Trump VotesFACT CHECKSince June 23, 2021, a political Facebook post has been shared at least tens of thousands of times. The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona. It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden’s Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes. In November 2021, the same misleading Maricopa County audit post was shared again, thrusting it back into the spotlight. For example, it was shared by...
__label__3 FBI Raid of James O'Keefe's House Is a Blow to Press FreedomOPINIONThe FBI searched the home of James O'Keefe—a conservative activist who films undercover videos for his organization, Project Veritas—on Saturday, reportedly because law enforcement wants to know how O'Keefe came to possess a diary allegedly stolen from Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden's daughter. The FBI also searched the homes of two O'Keefe associates. There's still much more to learn about the reasons for the search, but what we do know is troubling and potentially objectionable on the grounds of press freedom. O'Keefe has claimed that he received the diary from...
__label__2 California oil spill: Improved odds for animals caught in crudeFaster response times and dedicated resources are improving the odds for wildlife caught up in environmental disasters. We take a look behind the scenes to see what’s led to this progress. It was a joyous occasion. On Oct. 13, two birds – a ruddy duck and an eared grebe – were the first to be released after being rescued from an oil spill in the coastal waters of Southern California. Set free at a small beach in placid Huntington Harbor, the recovered grebe, once heavily oiled, immediately took flight. The...

Recent blog posts from a conservative watchdog group interested in animal research spending have prompted a wave of criticism aimed at the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, with lawmakers writing him over allegations that his government agency funded research that put beagles through cruel experiments.  The group, the White Coat Waste Project, founded in 2013 by former Republican strategist Anthony Bellotti,...
__label__3 Why Are the Media Treating 'Let's Go Brandon' Like Criminal Hate Speech?ANALYSISLast month, NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his victory in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Sparks 300 race when fans started chanting "fuck Joe Biden." But that's not what Stavast heard. And so the "let's go Brandon" chant—a less vulgar way of signaling one's opposition to the current president—was born. Fans say it at sports gatherings. Conservatives tweet it at each other. Even Republican politicians are getting in on it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) has been known to say it. So what? Well, even though it...
__label__2 New scramble for coal a reminder of how hard it is to go greenOn the eve of a climate summit where governments will be asked to pledge lower carbon emissions, demand for fossil fuels has spiked. That could shift the focus from targets to action. In the blue corner, the world’s accelerating drive to stem carbon emissions and turn back global warming. In the red corner, a sudden spike this month in global demand for fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. There’s a heavyweight fight going on over energy priorities, and it has dramatically raised the stakes for the most important...

It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__2 Cutting climate programs may be harder than other things as Biden trims his billAs moderate and progressive Democrats negotiate where to cut down a broad $3.5 trillion bill containing most of President Biden's domestic priorities, he is talking more and more about incremental progress. "My objective is to get everything that I campaigned on passed, eventually. It won't all happen at once," Biden told reporters this week during a trip to Michigan, making the argument that temporary new benefits and tax breaks would likely become permanent, if they gain popularity with voters over time. But Biden doesn't have that same luxury when it comes to...

The headline, shared in an Instagram post, referred to guard Brandon Goodwin, who played for the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks last season and before that with the Denver Nuggets and at Florida Gulf Coast University.  Goodwin, who is not currently with an NBA team, said himself in an October video that he blamed the vaccine "a thousand percent" for clots that cut short his 2020-21...
__label__3 MIT Canceled a Professor's Guest Lecture Because He Opposes Race-Based AdmissionsANALYSISDorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...
__label__2 Can Colorado Hospitals Turn Away Unvaccinated Patients?FACT CHECKAn article from Red Voice Media, self-described as being owned by “patriots” and fighting “false narratives against conservatives,” claims that “Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) signed an executive order this week that allows hospitals to turn away those who are unvaccinated against COVID-19.”  According to the article, the executive order “makes it clear that it authorizes discrimination against those who are not vaccinated for COVID-19.” The claim has also been widely shared on Twitter, with one user generating thousands of likes and retweets saying that: “The dem governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, signed...

__label__1 Fact Checking McAuliffe’s Claim That Youngkin Wants to Ban Books by Black AuthorsFACT CHECKThe Democratic nominee in the Virginia gubernatorial race Terry McAuliffe has accused his Republican opponent Glenn Youngkin of “want[ing] to ban books by prominent Black authors from Virginia schools.” McAuliffe has made similar comments in the past few days, claiming that Youngkin is “closing his campaign on banning books … he wants to ban Toni Morrison’s book Beloved” in an interview with Meet the Press on Sunday. The basis for this claim is Youngkin’s criticism of McAuliffe’s veto of two bills that would have allowed parents to opt their children out of reading texts that contain sexual material.

__label__5 The facts around an IRS proposal some claim would allow 'spying' on Americans' bank accountsANALYSISRecently, the Internal Revenue Service has gotten a lot of attention on social media -- specifically, an obscure proposal by the Biden administration to widen the authority to root out tax evasion by allowing the IRS to get annual, aggregated reports of flows from bank accounts with a minimum of $600. But it's not Biden officials or Democrats who are pushing the topic most aggressively on Twitter and other platforms. It's Republicans and right-wing media outlets attacking the proposal as a violation of privacy and arguing that the IRS would...

On Sept. 16, the student was told that his membership in the "oppressive" Federalist Society had "triggered" his peers. On Sept. 17, he was reminded that "there’s a bar you have to take." The meetings came in response to an email the student had sent inviting classmates to a happy hour at his "trap house," which elicited allegations that he was planning a blackface party.

How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice? Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there. And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades. We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles,...

Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could do.” This is a false statement.  As we mentioned in an...

__label__5 Fact-checking Biden’s claim that raising debt limit is usually bipartisanFACT CHECKFacing the prospect of the federal government running out of money to pay its bills in weeks, President Joe Biden said Senate Republicans are "reckless" and "hypocritical" by refusing to join Democrats in voting to raise the debt limit. "Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking, and it should be," Biden said Oct. 4.  Biden pointed the finger at Republicans, saying that they incurred debt during the Trump administration, and the Democrats helped them out at the time.

The restrictions appear to trace back to 2012, when in the face of growing alarm in Congress and the United Nations about online terrorist recruiting, Facebook added to its Community Standards a ban on “organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity.” This modest rule has since ballooned into what’s known as the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, a sweeping set of restrictions on what Facebook’s nearly...

__label__1 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...

The study is raising questions about the ability of social media companies to halt the flood of falsehoods on mainstream social media platforms during election cycles. NYU researchers say Trump tweets with fact-check labels spread further on Twitter than those without. And...
__label__3 WORST Censorship in August: 5 Ways Big Tech Silenced Online DiscussionOPINIONBig Tech corporations have increasingly censored more prominent politicians and celebrities as the woke executives in charge seemingly try to appease their radical Silicon Valley employees and the left.

Twitter suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for a week after she falsely claimed that the vaccines were "failing," while YouTube suspended Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., for a week over a since-removed video that made inaccurate claims about the effectiveness of masks. Greene’s account will be in read-only mode while her suspension lasts, a Twitter spokesperson said. The violating tweet was labeled in accordance with the company’s policy for moderating misleading COVID-19 information, including misleading claims about vaccines and masks.
__label__3 Amid Big Tech fight, web hosting company gives conservatives a cancel-proof alternativeAs conservatives look to fight back against what they see as an ideologically driven censorship push by Big Tech, one company is looking to make the building blocks of the Internet cancel-proof – giving conservatives more solid footing online. RightForge is an internet infrastructure company providing server space and web hosting, with what it describes as an ideological commitment to free speech, and it is offering a platform that caters to conservative outlets, campaigns and others who fear they could be canceled by Big Tech. "We are absolutely ideological," CEO Martin Avila told Fox...
__label__2 Does California Have Lowest COVID Case Rate of Any State?FACT CHECKCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has touted COVID case rate numbers in his state. Newsom tweeted that "California continues to lead the nation with the lowest COVID case rate" on October 4. He also noted the state's CDC transmission category, alongside a color map of the United States which was said to detail community transmission in states. On the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, there is a COVID data tracker which details levels of community transmission across the United States. As of October 5, California was noted to have 70.6 new cases...
__label__5 US Olympian Gwen Berry raises a fist in protest as IOC relaxes rules on free speechThese Olympic Games are never far from the hint of a gesture or protest, a moment of free speech, an opportunity to make a statement. So it came as absolutely no surprise that U.S. hammer thrower Gwen Berry entered the Olympic Stadium Tuesday night by raising her right fist not once but twice, several seconds apart, to announce that she of all people would be taking advantage of the International Olympic Committee’s relaxed rules allowing freedom of speech prior to the start of play. “It was the same thing,” she said...
__label__3 In Latest Election Meddling, Twitter Suspends J.D. Vance’s Campaign Press Account With ‘No Warning’In the Big Tech giant’s latest attempt at election meddling, Twitter suspended Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance’s campaign press account on Tuesday without any warning or reason. “Why did ⁦@Twitter/@jack suspend my campaign’s press account?” the “Hillbilly Elegy” author tweeted. Vance tweeted that the suspension of the @JDVancePress account, which has 69 followers and is following 189 others, came with “no warning” and did not indicate how long the suspension is expected to last. “No explanation of what rules I allegedly broke. But this is what happens when we allow...
__label__1 Doctors grow frustrated over COVID-19 denial, misinformationThe COVID-19 patient’s health was deteriorating quickly at a Michigan hospital, but he was having none of the doctor’s diagnosis. Despite dangerously low oxygen levels, the unvaccinated man didn’t think he was that sick and got so irate over a hospital policy forbidding his wife from being at his bedside that he threatened to walk out of the building. Dr. Matthew Trunsky didn’t hold back in his response: “You are welcome to leave, but you will be dead before you get to your car,’” he said. Such exchanges have become...
__label__5 Gun Violence in America Could Soon Get WorseOPINIONOver the past decade, amid rising mass shootings and fierce debate over America’s gun laws, the claim that “nothing ever changes” became a political cliché. The frustration was aimed in particular at the federal government—foremost at the failure by Congress to mandate a stronger and more comprehensive background-check system for gun buyers, a policy with long-standing bipartisan support among Americans, including gun owners. Much has changed in recent years, in fact, at the state and local levels, where governments adopted hundreds of regulations either tightening or loosening restrictions on firearms, a mix defined largely along partisan...
__label__3 School Investigates Teacher Who Said She Told Students to Pledge Allegiance to Pride FlagA California school district is investigating one of its teachers for encouraging students to pledge allegiance to the pride flag in place of the American flag, according to a viral video posted by the teacher and a district statement. Fox News identified the teacher as Kristin Pitzen of Newport-Mesa Unified School District in Orange County. In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...
__label__1 Supreme Court wrestles with limits on digital billboard ads, free speechThe Supreme Court on Wednesday wrestled with where to draw the line between a town’s right to restrict garish billboard ads and constitutional free speech protections.The justices posed difficult questions to both the lawyers supporting and arguing against an Austin, Texas, regulation that permits businesses to use digital billboards on their grounds but bans their use for off-site advertising.
__label__4 America can’t fix policing without fixing the country’s gun problemOPINIONI started reporting this article with a simple question: What would it look like to build a better police department from the ground up? Police in the US, after all, are more likely to shoot and kill someone than their peers around the developed world, and disproportionately the victims are Black Americans. Meanwhile, serious crimes are often unsolved — with almost half of murders in 2020 going uncleared. So I asked a dozen experts, focused on criminal justice, what could be done about this to build better police departments. They gave me a lot of different answers,...
__label__3 Twitter permanently suspends Alex Berenson over coronavirus tweetsTwitter has permanently suspended former New York Times journalist and author Alex Berenson, a critic of coronavirus lockdowns and mandates, from its platform. "The account you referenced has been permanently suspended for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation rules," a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News in response to an inquiry Saturday night. On his Substack page, Berenson subsequently posted a brief message, just over 152 characters, titled, "Goodbye Twitter." "This was the tweet that did it," he wrote, above a screenshot of his account before it was taken down. "Entirely accurate. I can’t wait to hear what a jury will...
__label__1 LinkedIn to shut down app in China following censorship controversyLinkedIn on Thursday said it will sunset the localized version of its app in China and will instead launch a new job boards app called "InJobs" later this year. Why it matters: In a statement, the company said it's making these changes because it's facing "a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China." Catch up quick: The news comes weeks after Axios China Reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian reported that LinkedIn blocked the profiles of several U.S. journalists from the company's China-based platform, citing "prohibited content." Allen-Ebrahimian posed questions to the tech giant about the...
__label__4 The NRA had a very good day in the Supreme CourtOPINIONThe biggest surprise in Wednesday morning’s arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. (NYSRPA) v. Bruen, a major Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court, is that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared open to many of New York state’s arguments defending its restrictions on where individuals may carry a gun. Even if Barrett does side with New York, however, her vote is unlikely to matter. Four justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — left little doubt that they will read the Second...
__label__3 Since Platform-by-Platform Censorship Doesn't Work, These Researchers Think, the Government Should Help 'Halt the Spread of Misinformation'ANALYSISBefore Twitter banned then–President Donald Trump in response to the January 6 Capitol riot, the platform tried to police his false claims about election fraud by attaching warning labels or blocking engagement with them. A new study suggests those efforts were ineffective at preventing the spread of Trump's claims and may even have backfired by drawing additional attention to messages that Twitter deemed problematic. Those findings highlight the limits of content moderation policies aimed at controlling misinformation and, more generally, the futility of responding to lies by trying to suppress them. But the researchers...
__label__2 Letters to the Editor: LAPD wants to uphold protesters’ free speech rights, Chief Michel Moore saysOPINIONTo the editor: The Los Angeles Police Department is committed to continuing to improve our performance with regard to protests, including documentation of dispersal orders and protecting the rights of peaceful demonstrators and journalists. (“Too few checks on police dispersal orders,” editorial, Sept. 30) Over time we have observed police officers confronted with violent and destructive behavior intermixed with otherwise peaceful protests. Efforts to separate peaceful demonstrators from those seeking to injure police officers or commit acts of arson and looting is difficult during a volatile incident. The department has no...
__label__4 Majority of Supreme Court appears to think N.Y. gun law is too restrictiveA majority of Supreme Court justices indicated Wednesday that they believe Americans generally have a right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense and that a New York law requiring special justification for getting such a permit is too restrictive. But it was unclear from a two-hour argument in the case how much more the court was willing to do to clarify the Second Amendment. Several expressed concern about allowing those with concealed weapons in sensitive areas, such as stadiums, crowded public events or places were alcohol is...
__label__3 Inside journalist’s desperate bid to save translator from TalibanEvery morning since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in the wake of the US withdrawal, journalist Toby Harnden waits for a call or a WhatsApp message from “R,” a translator he worked with on “First Casualty: The Untold Story of the CIA’s Secret Mission to Avenge 9/11” — his new book about the early days of the 2001 US invasion. “It’s a proof of life check,” Harnden told The Post. “Part of my dread is that he just drops off and I don’t hear from him again because God knows what...
__label__1 YouTube cracks down on anti-vax misinformationYouTube is beefing up its misinformation policies to crack down on anti-vaccine misinformation beyond COVID-19 vaccinations, executives told Axios. Why it matters: Under the new policy, YouTube will terminate the channels of what it calls prominent vaccine misinformation spreaders, including the channel of the Robert F Kennedy Jr.-affiliated Children's Health Defense Fund. YouTube will also terminate the channels belonging to Joseph Mercola, Erin Elizabeth and Sherri Tenpenny — all identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as among a dozen playing leading roles in spreading online misinformation about COVID vaccines. Driving the...
__label__4 The Supreme Court case that could gut America’s gun laws, explainedOPINIONFor nearly all its history, the Supreme Court kept its distance from gun policy. Now it’s about to decide a case that could radically reduce the government’s power to regulate guns. The Second Amendment states explicitly that it exists to protect “a well regulated Militia,” and until fairly recently, the Court took these four words very seriously. As a unanimous Court explained in United States v. Miller (1939), the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias, and the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that...
__label__3 Facebook Oversight Board Member Says Fact-Checking Outside JurisdictionA member of Facebook's independent oversight board said this week that the company's third-party fact-checking program is outside the panel's jurisdiction, which "makes a lot of people quite nervous," Politico reports. Michael McConnell, a former federal judge who now sits on the oversight board, said during the Technology Policy Institute's Aspen Forum on Monday that Facebook's fact-checking operation is "something that we don't review, and yet this is something if you ask people what they think is a problem at Facebook, that's on a lot of people's lists." Julie Owono, the executive...
__label__2 At police lines, not all journalists are created equalOPINIONFor a lot of journalism’s history, BIPOC experiences have been told through a white lens. Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...
__label__4 Gun violence is up across the country. It’s changing mayoral politics.Kasim Reed wasn’t planning on running for another term as mayor of Atlanta. But rising crime and the problems that have come with it — like one of Atlanta’s wealthiest districts trying to secede from the city — pushed him out of mayoral retirement and into an already crowded race. Homicides and shootings are up and the number of cops is down in cities from Atlanta to Seattle. Crime, as a result, is dominating the discourse in mayoral races — driving candidates to talk about beefing up police patrols and...
__label__3 High School Students Need A Lesson On Free SpeechOPINIONAs high schools prepare to reopen and in-person teaching resumes, students will face many unknowns. One question that must be answered this fall is whether the cancel culture that has plagued the nation will continue in our education institutions. Sadly, new data suggest that the strong impulse to silence those who might be offensive to some will continue. High school communities should push back against current tendencies, however, and demand students have the chance to confront challenging ideas and experience the discomfort that is at the core of the educational...
__label__2 Afghan journalists’ battle: To keep free expression aliveThe message of the vengeful Taliban fighters was clear when they raided the offices of state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) in Logar province, as the region south of Kabul fell to the jihadist juggernaut in mid-August. An Afghan journalist describes being severely beaten as the Taliban destroyed his computer with an assault rifle, then trashed the television and radio studio. “Shut up and don’t raise your voice!” a fighter warned the journalist. “If you raise your voice, we will kill you.” For days afterward, he had nightmares that the Taliban...
__label__4 Attorney General Merrick Garland in Chicago on Thursday and Friday to bolster city’s battle with gun violenceAttorney General Merrick Garland returns to his native Chicago on Thursday and Friday to bolster the city’s battle with unrelenting gun violence. Garland, raised in north suburban Lincolnwood, will be in Chicago for the launch of firearms trafficking strike forces in five cities Thursday. In Chicago, he will visit a Chicago Police Department “strategic decision support center” in the afternoon. In the evening, Garland will attend a “listening session” with people who are part of a program to reduce gun violence — with intervention and prevention a key element in...
__label__3 Silenced!OPINIONAre they still protesting in Cuba? I don't know. The Cuban government has shut off the Cuban people's internet. The big demonstrations began four weeks ago, sparked, curiously, by a rap song. The key lyric is: "Freedom! No more Doctrine!" "Doctrine" refers to the "constant cycle of propaganda" from the government, explains Cuban emigre Alian Collazo in my newest video. Sadly, silly TV reporters in America claimed the protests were about "hunger, pandemic restrictions and the lack of COVID vaccinations," or, according to ABC's George Stephanopoulos, "food and fuel shortages." "Nonsense!"...
__label__2 Free speech in a pandemic: Congress wrestles with drawing a lineWhen Twitter recently banned a former New York Times journalist dubbed “the pandemic’s wrongest man,” many of his critics cheered. But others, including some who oppose his views, raised concerns about a world in which private corporations – taking their cues from mainstream media and government officials – can silence dissenters in today’s digital public square. Over the past year and a half, Alex Berenson grew his Twitter base to some 344,000 followers by pillorying public health officials’ approach to the pandemic. Like many Twitter pundits, he was irreverent and provocative....
__label__5 Joe Biden gets history wrong on the Second Amendment limiting gun ownershipFACT CHECKPresident Joe Biden’s plan to curb rising violence relies on several steps: more aid to local police departments, expanding job programs for young adults, more violence intervention programs, and tougher measures to shut down gun sellers who break federal laws. "Rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them," Biden said June 23. "There has always been the ability to limit — rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it." And, Biden said,...
__label__3 At Least We Still Have Free Speech and PressOPINIONAs a long-time observer of American radio, TV and newspapers, I am appalled by claims some people are placing on Facebook that we no longer have a free press. These claims, freely transmitted over the internet, would seem to contradict themselves. One wonders if these people have any understanding of what life was like in a country that really did not have a free press: the Soviet Union prior to Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost (free speech). The Soviet censorship agency, Glavlit, employed 80,000 people. Nothing could be published — even a...
__label__1 YouTube says content policing is good for businessWhile critics allege YouTube puts profits over public safety, product head Neal Mohan insists that the Google-owned video site is working to be a better content moderator, in part because it is good for business. Why it matters: Users spend billions of hours watching videos on YouTube, and the site's content recommendations shape how that time is spent. Facebook and Twitter tend to get more attention on content moderation, but YouTube remains an equally important information battleground. Driving the news: YouTube is announcing Monday that it now has two million people in...
__label__5 Ex-NRA President Duped Into Speaking At Event Staged By Parkland Parents’ GroupA gun safety group tricked two high-profile gun advocates into addressing a fake high school graduation ceremony featuring a sea of empty chairs meant to represent the children who did not finish school because they were shot. Videos of the stunt were posted Wednesday by Change the Ref, an organization founded by Patricia and Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was murdered in the Parkland, Florida school shooting in 2018. The group staged a ceremony in Las Vegas for the graduating class of James Madison Academy, a school that does not...

"Everything I said in that tweet is true," Rubin told Fox News in an interview. "Every single thing that I said in that tweet was true and this is a complete continuation of silencing any sort of dissent, anyone that questions the narrative is in a lot of trouble when it comes to Big Tech and we better fight it because we're running out of time." The tweet...
__label__1 Twitter asks users to flag COVID-19 and election misinformationTwitter introduced a new test feature Tuesday that allows users to report misinformation they run into on the platform, flagging it to the company as “misleading.” The test will roll out starting today to most users in the U.S., Australia and South Korea. In the new test, Twitter users will be able to expand the three dot contextual menu in the upper right corner of a tweet to select “report tweet” where they’ll be met with the new option to flag a misleading tweet. The next menu offers users a...
__label__4 Lara Trump Recklessly Urges Residents Near Border to ‘Arm Up and Get Guns’Lara Trump appeared on Fox News late Saturday and stoked fears about immigrants crossing the southern border before urging residents there to “arm up and get guns.” The former president’s daughter-in-law began by accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of “laughing off the crisis at the border” and then declared that Border Patrol and ICE agents are “being made a mockery of” as immigrants supposedly just stroll over the border. Apparently having forgotten about the events of Jan. 6, when similarly incendiary rhetoric vilifying authorities led to thousands storming the U.S....
__label__3 When Is a Constitutional Right Not a Right?OPINIONIf you want to carry a firearm in New York state, you need to convince a local official that you have “proper cause.” That’s easy in some counties but almost impossible in others, including New York City. On Wednesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen about whether this policy is unconstitutional. New York is one of only six states (the others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey) that condition the right to bear arms on an official’s discretion, which is...
__label__2 Apple’s Software Chief Explains ‘Misunderstood’ iPhone Child-Protection FeaturesApple’s tools for flagging child pornography and identifying explicit photos in kids’ messages caused backlash and confusion. In an exclusive interview, Apple software chief Craig Federighi sat down with WSJ’s Joanna Stern to defend the technology and explain how it will work.
__label__5 Biden calls for gun reform 5 years after Pulse nightclub shootingFive years to the day after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., President Joe Biden called for the Senate to pass gun legislation to address what he called a “public health epidemic of gun violence.”“It is long past time we close the loopholes that allow gun buyers to bypass background checks in this country, and the Senate should start by passing the three House-passed bills which would do exactly that,” Biden said in a statement.
__label__3 Supreme Court To Hear Major Second Amendment CaseThe U.S. Supreme Court is due to hand down a major ruling on American’s Second Amendment rights. The court recently announced it will hear a case soon, which could potentially increase the number of people able to carry a gun in public. According to gun rights advocates, a favorable ruling by the Supreme Court would make it harder for Democrat-led cities to deprive citizens of the right to carry guns in public. “We feel that the suit is: One, to bring equal justice and equal protection to the people, the...
__label__1 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Twitter account has been suspended for a week for spreading COVID-19 misinformationRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Twitter account has been suspended for a week after she tweeted misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.  The temporary ban came after the Georgia Republican wrote on Twitter on Monday evening that the vaccines are "failing." "The FDA should not approve the covid vaccines. There are too many reports of infection & spread of #COVID19 among vaccinated people," Greene tweeted. "These vaccines are failing & do not reduce the spread of the virus & neither do masks. Vaccine mandates & passports violate individual freedoms." Coronavirus cases have...
__label__4 Free Guns Are Now a COVID-Vaccine Incentive in the USGet a shot for a chance to fire a shot—from a brand-new rifle. That’s how West Virginia is trying to boost its lagging vaccination numbers before the start of the summer.  Anyone who gets at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine will be able to enter to win one of 10 custom-made rifles and shotguns and a range of other prizes in a drawing on June 20, which is Father’s Day.  “This is for all people that have been vaccinated: If you got vaccinated back in the...
__label__3 Why Martin Luther King Couldn't Get a Carry PermitANALYSISAfter his home was bombed in 1956, Martin Luther King Jr. applied for a permit to carry a gun. Despite the potentially deadly threats that King faced as a leader of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott, the county sheriff, Mac Sim Butler, said no. Next week the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York law similar to the Alabama statute that empowered local officials like Butler to decide who could exercise the constitutional right to bear arms. The briefs urging the Court to overturn New York's statute include several...
__label__1 Dwayne Johnson Pledges to Stop Using Real Guns on His Productions, Following ‘Rust’ TragedyDwayne Johnson’s new movie for Netflix, “Red Notice,” stars three of the biggest celebrities on the planet — Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot — and is one of many Hollywood films that feature firearms for the sake of action-packed storylines. “Red Notice,” which launches on the streaming service on Nov. 12, followed very careful safety protocols on-set, as most productions do. But after the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on Alec Baldwin’s film “Rust,” Johnson is pledging to stop using real firearms on all projects that are produced by his...
__label__5 Matt Gaetz Suggests Shooting People In Silicon Valley For ‘Cancel’ CultureRep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican under federal investigation for alleged sex trafficking, suggested Thursday that followers should use their Second Amendment rights against social media companies that silence conservatives. “The internet’s hall monitors out in Silicon Valley, they think they can suppress us, discourage us,” he said at a rally in Dalton, Georgia, co-hosted by Rep.

Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...
__label__5 What if Cops Needed Permission to Draw Their Guns?ANALYSISA year has passed since the most notorious police murder of a Black man this century, and so little has changed. With each week, the public learns that yet another unarmed Black man has been killed by the police, more often by gun than by knee. Some will find my characterization too reductive; the circumstances of a police encounter matter, they will say. But it is the simple truth. About one Black man in 1,000 will be killed by a police officer, and nearly 1 in 5 of those men will be unarmed....
__label__3 CDC To Restart Initiative To Study Gun ViolenceThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restarted the agency’s gun violence research initiative. During an interview on Friday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky described gun violence as a serious public health threat. “This is not a conversation about having them or not having them. This is a conversation about how we can make them being here safe,” said Walensky. “The research that we intend to do is going to be squarely about making America safe. Making people safe.” The agency plans to spend more than $10 million to track...

There were 98 deaths that resulted from unintentional shootings by children from March through December 2019 compared to 128 over that same period in 2020, research by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety shows. And the trend continues to worsen during the pandemic, the groups says. So far, in 2021 there have been at least 259 unintentional shootings by children, resulting in 104 deaths and 168...
__label__5 NRA claim overstates Biden's remarks on gun controlFACT CHECKDuring his first address to a joint session of Congress on April 28, President Joe Biden called on lawmakers to take urgent action on gun violence in the U.S., which he declared an "epidemic." There have been at least 142 mass shootings since Biden's first day in office, according to nonprofit research group Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as incident with four or more people injured or killed.  Biden has said he is "not opposed to the Second Amendment." But a recent Instagram post from the...
__label__3 Eric Adams Says NYC Must ‘Go After The Guns’ after Weekend of ViolenceDemocratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams suggested that New York City must “go after guns” after ten people were injured by a shooting in Queens over the weekend that police say was gang-related.“We need a joint gangs and guns task force with federal, state and city coordination to make sure that we can do information sharing, go after the guns that are on the street, stop the flow of guns and take down these crews,” Adams said, according to ABC 7.
__label__2 U.S. Justice Department says Missouri state gun law is unconstitutionalPresident Joe Biden's Justice Department is stepping up its fight against a new state law in Missouri that aims to invalidate many federal gun regulations, saying the measure has impeded law enforcement efforts to work with state and local police and is also unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a statement of interest in an ongoing lawsuit in Cole County, Missouri, saying the state's Second Amendment Preservation Act, also known as "HB85," should be declared unconstitutional and that the court should issue a injunction barring its enforcement. "HB85 is...

__label__3 House Republicans push impeachment resolution against David Chipman as decision looms for moderate Senate DemsSome House Republicans are pushing a resolution to impeach David Chipman, President Biden's nominee to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) – even before he's been confirmed by the Senate. The effort, which is more political messaging than anything, is led by Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont. It comes as at least five moderate Democrats remain undecided on the controversial nominee with a history of working for major gun control groups, and as the timing for Chipman's final confirmation remains unclear. The White House and a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not...
__label__2 Mexico Sues US Gunmakers Over Arms TraffickingMexico said it filed a lawsuit against major US gunmakers in a Boston court on Wednesday over illegal cross-border arms flows that it blamed for fueling rampant drug-related violence. The Latin American nation, which has long faced pressure from the United States to curb narcotics smuggling, wants its neighbor to crack down on firearms trafficking in the other direction. This kind of legal action is unprecedented for the Mexican government and has the backing of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a news conference. "We are...
__label__4 Opinion on the use of puberty blockers in America is turningWorries about the use of puberty blockers, which are prescribed to some children to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (like breasts and facial hair) have been mounting in much of the rich world. Some countries have scaled back their use. Not America. Doctors who work in transgender clinics routinely claim that prescribing such drugs is conservative, because their effects are largely reversible, and compassionate, because they save children with gender dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body) from enormous distress. That may be beginning to change. Last...
__label__3 AG Garland Going to Chicago in Bid to Bolster Battle With Gun ViolenceAttorney General Merrick Garland will head to Chicago on Thursday in an effort to demonstrate the Biden administration’s commitment to curbing gun violence in the city, multiple media outlets are reporting. Garland is returning to his hometown to launch a firearms trafficking strike force in the city. In June, he had announced the plan for strike forces in Chicago,  as well Los Angeles, Washington, New York and San Francisco, according to Politico. The Associated Press reported the new effort includes bolstering enforcement in so-called supply areas where it is easier to obtain...
__label__2 A new political tone over gun violence?As shootings rise, a primary race in New York and President Biden’s anti-crime package reflect a more nuanced approach to crime. In more than 100 countries, the homicide rate has been falling over the past 13 years. Not so in the United States. In the past 18 months, starting before the pandemic, the murder rate has risen 25% to 30%, mainly in big cities, with warnings of a violent summer. The reasons remain unclear but combined with last year’s movement for racial justice and police reform, it could be creating...

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, led 24 other Republican senators to file an amicus brief, arguing that the New York state laws making it hard to carry a gun outside the home violate the Second Amendment.

__label__1 US military guns keep vanishing, some used in street crimesPulling a pistol from his waistband, the young man spun his human shield toward police. “Don’t do it!” a pursuing officer pleaded. The young man complied, releasing the bystander and tossing the gun, which skittered across the city street and then into the hands of police. They soon learned that the 9mm Beretta had a rap sheet. Bullet casings linked it to four shootings, all of them in Albany, New York. And there was something else. The pistol was U.S. Army property, a weapon intended for use against America’s enemies,...
__label__4 Can the US cut drug prices without sacrificing new cures?ANALYSISCongress’s ambitious plans to expand health coverage are crashing up against one of the great questions in health policy: Can they force the pharmaceutical industry to hold down prescription drug prices without sacrificing the medical innovation that could lead to new treatments and cures in the future? Democrats’ Build Back Better reconciliation bill sets a hard cap on the price Medicare would pay for some prescription drugs, ensuring that the program would pay no more than 20 percent more than other wealthy nations. Those prices would also be available to the commercial plans that cover...
__label__3 Barely Legal Teens Can Legally Buy Guns, Appeals Court SaysANALYSISThe constitutional right to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment should apply to those between the ages of 18–20, declared the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit today in Hirschfeld v. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Tanner Hirschfeld and Natalia Marshall challenged the constitutionality of federal laws that ban federally licensed firearm dealers from selling handguns and handgun ammunition to 18–20 year olds. Those federal restrictions have been on the books since 1968. Hirschfeld is now over 21 but Marshall is not. She felt she had...
__label__1 US saw biggest spike in gun violence in 50 years. Don’t panic yet.The surge in gun violence during the pandemic has strengthened both pro- and anti-police stances. But experts – and history – indicate that a more nuanced approach is needed. Last year likely marked America’s largest single-year rise in gun violence in 50 years – sparked by a sharp increase in shootings after the pandemic began. Though the FBI won’t release official numbers until the fall, Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at Princeton University in New Jersey and an expert on violent crime, estimates the national murder rate rose by 25% to...
__label__5 “What Exactly Is the Plan for Us?”OPINIONMary Baliker, a 58-year-old kidney transplant recipient living in Middleton, Wisconsin, is no stranger to blood tests. But this one was different. As part of a clinical study on antibody responses, she has been periodically FedEx-ing her blood to Johns Hopkins, where doctors have been looking for immune responses to the Moderna vaccine. Because she takes immunosuppressive drugs so her body doesn’t reject the donated organ, it wasn’t very likely that the vaccine would prompt the immune response it is supposed to. Nevertheless, she held out hope. When the final...
__label__3 Biden’s Blunders And Lies About Firearms And The Second AmendmentOPINIONProfessional “fact checkers” at the Washington Post and elsewhere aren’t notable for their pro-gun bias. In the past, for example, these propagandists have condemned as incorrect claims that Hillary Clinton doesn’t believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense, and that Joe Biden supports gun confiscation, while using the same framework of politically desirable reality to uphold bogus gun control talking points – for instance, Biden’s statements that no background checks are required for firearm purchases at gun shows, that gun manufacturers are the only entities “exempt from being sued,” and that the Clinton...
__label__2 ‘Constitutional carry’ comes to Texas. The trend in five charts.When Texas changes its gun laws, the United States takes notice. But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 other states. What are the effects so far? Soon, most adult Texans will be able to openly carry a handgun in public. No background check or training necessary. It will be a major expansion in gun rights, one that Texas is uncharacteristically late in arriving at. About 20 other states already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont. Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun...
__label__5 Most adults shouldn't take daily aspirin to prevent heart attack, panel saysTaking a daily low-dose aspirin has long been recommended for heart health, but an influential organization changed its guidance on Tuesday. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts, released an updated draft recommendation that says most adults not take aspirin to prevent first heart attacks or strokes.
__label__3 Report: Joe Biden’s Gun Control Push Hurts Democrats in 2022A report by Fox News claims President Joe Biden’s push for gun control as part of the solution to surging crime is detrimental to the Democrat effort to hold Congress in 2022. Fox News claims the gun control-laden response to crime could be even more detrimental, when seen in combination with the efforts to hamper police around the country: Biden’s focus on gun crimes could provide fodder for Second Amendment advocates who have accused him of attacking legal gun ownership and for Republican lawmakers who have argued that Democratic calls to “defund...
__label__2 California has the most gun-control laws in US. Do they work?ANALYSISCalifornia is by far the most regulated state in America when it comes to restricting the sale, use, and ownership of guns. Gun-control advocates call it the national leader, the “tip of the spear” setting the tone for other states, as Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at Brady, a gun-control advocacy group, puts it. The Golden State also has had a series of high-profile public mass shootings in recent years – in San Bernardino, Thousand Oaks, and this week, San Jose. On May 26, a gunman opened fire on...

The consulting giant has had its hand in a range of important FDA projects, from revamping drug-approval processes to implementing new tools for monitoring the pharmaceutical industry. During that same decade-plus span, as emerged in 2019, McKinsey counted among its clients many of the country’s biggest drug companies — not least those responsible for making, distributing and selling the opioids that have ravaged communities across the United States, such as Purdue...
__label__3 San Jose Wants to Force Gun Owners to Carry Insurance and Pay FeesOn Tuesday, the San Jose City Council unanimously advanced a number of novel gun control proposals, including requirements that gun owners carry liability insurance and that they pay a fee to cover the public costs of gun violence. "While the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, it does not require taxpayers to subsidize gun ownership," said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo in a Tuesday press release. "We won't magically end gun violence, but we will stop paying for it." These proposals come a month after a workplace shooting at a light...
__label__1 We're Seeing A Spike In Workplace Shootings. Here's WhyWorkplace mass shootings are rare, but the killing of eight people by a fellow employee at a Northern California rail yard on Wednesday marks the third such rampage in under two months. That could foreshadow a rise in this type of violence after the nationwide shutdown of businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, says Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. However, Schildkraut stresses that while such shootings "are increasing incrementally in frequency, they're still extremely statistically rare." In San Jose...
__label__5 We Need to Shrink Big Pharma Until It’s Small Enough to Drown in a BathtubOPINIONNow that George W. Bush is back in the news with his attacks on Trumpist insurrectionists, it might be worth reviving one of the great lines of his presidency. After the September 11 attack, when Bush decided to go after not just the terrorists who planned the hijackings, but all sorts of people around the world he didn’t like, he lumped them together as “evildoers.” That may not be the most eloquent phrase, but it works well as a description of the modern pharmaceutical industry. Some may find this description...

__label__1 Supreme Court jumps into U.S. culture wars with abortion, gun casesANALYSISThe Supreme Court has placed itself back on the frontlines of the U.S. culture wars by taking up major cases on abortion and guns, with rights cherished by millions of Americans - and potentially the future of the nation’s top judicial body itself - on the line. And to add to the drama, rulings in the two cases are expected to come next year in the run-up to mid-term elections in a politically polarized United States that will decide if President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats maintain control over both chambers...
__label__4 Why Democrats desperately need to cut prescription drug pricesANALYSISDemocrats can’t do much on health care if they don’t cut prescription drug costs. Democrats had big dreams for health care reform this year. In the forthcoming budget reconciliation bill, they planned to cover millions of uninsured people and offer dental and vision benefits to people on Medicare, while also cutting prescription drug costs. But now those grand ambitions are crashing against the hard reality of legislating with incredibly narrow margins in Congress. If only a few members balk at what the Biden White House and Democratic leaders want to do, that could be enough to doom...
__label__3 State Legislators Want to Nullify Federal Gun ControlANALYSISState legislators across the country are working to weaken the enforcement of federal gun laws by emulating immigration activists. As President Joe Biden takes executive action to strengthen federal gun laws, state legislators across the country are working to weaken their enforcement by emulating immigration activists. Since 1987, Oregon has prohibited law enforcement agencies from arresting or detaining people whose only crime was entering or living in the U.S. illegally. Hundreds of other jurisdictions have followed suit, becoming so-called sanctuary cities. "The methods that we need to use are the...

Judge Harlin Hale's decision came after New York Attorney General Letitia James and others questioned the legitimacy of the bankruptcy filing. Law360 first reported the ruling. The NRA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 15 after James filed a lawsuit to dissolve the gun-rights organization, alleging that it had abused its legal status as a nonprofit.

Democrats are facing tough moral and political decisions over how to pursue their century-old dream of universal health care now that their ambitious $3.5 trillion social safety net bill will almost certainly have to be trimmed back. As they try to reduce the bill’s cost, members of the party disagree over whether to prioritize expanding coverage to more poor adults in states whose leaders have refused to...
__label__3 Federal Judge Overturns California's Ban on 'Assault-Style' WeaponsA federal judge overturned California's 32-year-old ban on so-called assault-style weapons on Friday, describing it as a "failed experiment" and prompting scathing criticism from the state's governor and attorney general.California has prohibited the sale of the weapons since 1989. The ban was challenged in a 2019 lawsuit against California's attorney general by plaintiffs including James Miller, a state resident, and the San Diego County Gun Owners, a political action committee.
__label__1 There Have Been, On Average, 10 Mass Shootings In The U.S. Each Week This YearWhen a man walked into a birthday party in Colorado Springs, Colo., over the weekend, killing six people and then himself, it was the deadliest mass shooting in the state since March, when a rampage at a grocery store left 10 people dead. We're just 18 weeks into 2021, and already the U.S. has experienced 194 mass shootings. That averages out to about 10 a week. The tally comes from the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot...

__label__3 Biden's ATF nominee stumped on defining 'assault weapon' during confirmation hearingPresident Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was stumped during his confirmation hearing when he was asked to define an “assault weapon." “I got 35 seconds left, define it for me, would you please, sir. What's an assault weapon?” Sen. John Kennedy asked ATF nominee David Chipman on Wednesday. "There's no way I could define an assault weapon," Chipman said. “I'll give you one definition that ATF currently uses" Chipman continued, as Kennedy interjected that he wanted Chipman’s personal definition.
__label__1 8 lingering questions about the new Covid pills from Merck and PfizerThe past two months have brought extremely good news in the fight against Covid-19. Two different oral treatments have proved effective at both preventing people newly diagnosed with Covid-19 from entering the hospital and from dying. “We’re accelerating our path out of this pandemic,” President Biden said after data on the second Covid pill became available. The wide availability of oral drugs could make Covid-19 less lethal, making it less risky for people to return to in-person work and to their normal lives. The first results, from Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics,...

__label__2 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...
__label__5 J&J vaccine booster shot raises antibody levels 9-fold, company saysIn the midst of a delta variant surge, a new study finds that giving a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot six months after primary vaccination results in a nine-fold increase of a crucial antibody response, according to a company press release. Meanwhile, a prior study found that people vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine still had a durable immune response at least eight months later, even without a booster. Collectively, the findings could help inform the U.S. government's recommendations about booster shots for the 14 million people who received the...
__label__3 The DOJ Released A 115-Page Rule Change To Redefine A ‘Firearm.’ Here’s What You Need To Know.ANALYSISOn Friday, The Department of Justice published a 115-page document detailing a proposed rule change that would redefine what constitutes a firearm. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the new definition “take[s] into account technological developments and modern terminology in the firearms industry, as well as amendments to the marking and recordkeeping requirements.” The newly proposed rule would redefine a “ghost gun” or precursor firearm parts as a firearm under federal law.

And the surge among the unvaccinated is overwhelming health care workersANALYSISAs experts race to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 by encouraging vaccinations and mask wearing, hospital systems in a handful of states are now straining to keep up with the surge. Eight states, many of which have lagged the national average for vaccinations, have Covid-19 patients that account for at least 15% of their overall hospitalizations: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. Of all Covid-19 hospitalizations, these eight states' combined totals make up...
__label__3 ATF's Proposed Rules Threaten a Legal Mess but No End to Ghost GunsANALYSISRegulations might reshape DIY gun products, but they can’t eliminate the demand that created the industry. There's little reason to expect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) proposed "ghost gun" regulations to actually eliminate ghost guns. That doesn't mean that plans to regulate the market for 80 percent receivers and otherwise impose new red tape on gun users and makers won't have an impact—they will undoubtedly create headaches for many people. But it does mean that the vague verbiage in the proposed rules has a long way...

__label__3 California May Soften Gun Crime Laws, Citing Impact On People Of ColorA California state assembly committee gave its stamp of approval on April 27 to legislation that would significantly soften sentences for people convicted of some firearm offenses, with proponents saying laws against using guns in the commission of crimes disproportionately affect people of color. The Assembly Public Safety Committee voted 6-2 to approve the Anti-Racism Sentencing Reform Act, though the proposal still has several hurdles to clear before becoming law.
__label__1 White House unveils effort to address military toxic exposuresThe White House on Thursday announced a new strategy to identify and treat health issues in veterans who may have been exposed to chemical, physical and environmental hazards while serving. Why it matters: The Department of Veterans Affairs has recognized that certain illnesses present in veterans are directly caused by or linked to overlooked health hazards present during specific conflicts, such as Agent Orange, a herbicide used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, along the Korea demilitarized zone in the late 1960s and other locations.
__label__4 A Quick Reminder That Mandating Vaccines Is Totally ConstitutionalOPINIONAnti-vaxxers and anti-mask people are loud and wrong all the time. It’s a devastating combination. They’ve got an entire white-wing media echo-sphere that amplifies their wrong ideas. They have social media algorithms that elevate their ignorance and misinformation, such that even calling them out boosts their uninformed or willfully false takes. Moreover, the sheer breadth of things they are wrong about is dizzying. The vaccine has been blamed for everything from causing new Covid-19 variants (it doesn’t) to granting people the power to control metal, like Magneto (I wish). The...

Many consumers will see lower prices because Congress passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid bill in March that provided larger premium subsidies and made more people eligible for them. Democrats are now negotiating to preserve the expanded subsidies, which are set to end next year, in Mr. Biden’s social-spending and climate bill.

__label__3 Doctors Can Prescribe Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine Off-Label for COVID-19: Nebraska AGNebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson issued a legal opinion saying that his office won’t seek disciplinary action against doctors who prescribe hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin as off-label medicines to treat or prevent COVID-19, as long as they are not engaging in any misconduct. The opinion (pdf), issued on Oct. 14, was in response to a request from Dannette Smith, CEO of the state’s Department of Health, which licenses and disciplines doctors. Smith asked whether it would be “deemed unlawful or otherwise subject to discipline” for doctors to prescribe ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, or other “off label use” medications to...
__label__2 This arthritis drug cost $198 in 2008. Now it's more than $10,000In 2008, a box of 30 anti-inflammatory rectal suppositories that treats arthritis, called Indocin, had a price tag of $198. As of Oct. 1, the price of that same box was 52 times higher, totaling $10,350. Why it matters: As federal lawmakers continue to waver on drug price reforms, Indocin is another example of how nothing prevents drug companies from hiking prices at will and selling them within a broken supply chain. Driving the news: Indocin has changed ownership multiple times over the years, and the companies involved have controversial histories. Iroko Pharmaceuticals,...

Through a memo on Monday, Troy Miller, the interim head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), rescinded several guidelines issued during the Trump administration that upheld the so-called "metering" practice at land ports of entry. Using metering, U.S. officials would restrict the number of migrants who could legally ask for humanitarian protection at ports of entry. The practice began under President Barack Obama and was...

Slimming down the cost of the Democrats’ massive $3.5 trillion social-welfare spending bill is a compromise that misses the point. Opposition to the tax-and-spending bill is not just about cost, it’s about a policy agenda that shifts more power and control to the federal government and away from...

But the BBC can reveal there are serious errors in a number of key studies that the drug's promoters rely on. For some years ivermectin has been a vital anti-parasitic medicine used to treat humans and animals. But during the pandemic there has been a clamour from some proponents for using the drug for something else - to fight Covid and prevent deaths. The health authorities in the US, UK...

The Biden administration issued a new policy Wednesday that directs agents to stay away from playgrounds, domestic violence shelters, healthcare facilities, public demonstrations, disaster response centers, and other locations. The new “protected areas” policy went into effect immediately and supersedes all previous guidance for what used to be called “sensitive locations.” For years now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had been instructed to avoid arresting people in places of worship, hospitals, courthouses,...
__label__3 Federal Judge Grants Injunction Against NY COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for Health Care WorkersA federal judge on Tuesday ruled in favor of 17 New York state healthcare workers who object to religious reasons to getting a COVID-19 vaccine. The judge said defendants, state officials, failed to adequately explain why workers were denied from religious exemptions to a vaccine mandate imposed in August. “There is no adequate explanation from defendants about why the ‘reasonable accommodation’ that must be extended to a medically exempt health care worker under 2.61 could not similarly be extended to a healthcare worker with a sincere religious objection,” U.S. District Judge...

__label__4 Biden Is About to Restart One of the Cruelest Parts of Trump’s Anti-Immigrant RegimeANALYSISUnder a court-mandated order, the Biden administration is gearing up to bring back a Trump-era border policy that pushed thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers into Mexico, to wait there for their hearings in US immigration courts. The move comes after a Trump-appointed federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri in a lawsuit challenging the termination of the program and ordered the administration to reinstate it “in good faith.” The government is appealing the ruling and drafting a memo to once again rescind MPP, meanwhile, it’s also hiring contractors to rebuild tent courts in Laredo and Brownsville...
__label__3 COVID-19 Hospital Admissions Fall for 1st Time in Weeks Across US: HHSHospital admissions for COVID-19 patients in the United States are declining for the first time since late June, suggesting the latest surge has peaked. The seven-day average of new daily hospitalizations with confirmed COVID-19 dropped by 2.4 percent from a week earlier to about 12,280—the first such drop since around June 27, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It comes as fewer hospitalizations are being reported in Florida, Texas, and other Southern states, the agency said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 tracker shows that the seven-day...
__label__2 Biden Administration Delays New Health Insurance Price Transparency Rules At Least 6 MonthsGoing to the doctor or getting surgery in the United States—even with health insurance—can feel like stepping into a financial black hole. How much of the bill your health insurer will pay and how much of it will fall to you can be a mystery until after the service has taken place and the bill arrives.  That’s finally going to change. It’ll just take a little longer than planned.  Parts of a final Transparency in Coverage rule issued by the Trump Administration in October 2020 were set to go into effect on...
__label__4 Biden administration says it’s ready to restore ‘Remain in Mexico’ along border next monthThe Biden administration is prepared to reimplement the Trump-era border policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols in mid-November if the Mexican government agrees to accept the return of asylum seekers to its territory, administration officials said Thursday. In August, a U.S. District Court in Texas ordered the Biden administration to restart MPP, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” faulting the White House for ending the program improperly. The Supreme Court upheld the decision, forcing Biden officials to restore a policy the president has deplored as inhumane. The Department of Homeland Security...
__label__3 Key Medicare Fund Will Be Insolvent in Just Five YearsANALYSISFive years. That's how long until Medicare officially can't pay all of its bills, according to the latest report on the program's fiscal health. After that, without changes, the program will start to miss payments. Medicare is on track for a serious fiscal meltdown.  First, the gory details: Starting in 2026, the program's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, which covers a variety of inpatient hospital services, will be depleted, leaving the fund to operate on a cash-flow basis—and there won't be enough cash coming into the program to pay all of the...
__label__1 The social network for doctors is full of vaccine disinformationDr. Paul Malarik, a retired psychiatrist, now spends about 50 hours a month helping to administer Covid-19 vaccines at pop-up clinics near his home in San Luis Obispo, California. So he’s particularly troubled when he logs onto Doximity, a site used by doctors, and reads anti-vaccine comments. “You rarely get to the level of microchips in vaccines, but a lot of this stuff is pretty close to it,” said Malarik, who volunteers his time to mix vaccines, put shots in arms and educate the public. “They’re actively working against us.” Doximity,...
__label__4 Biden’s incoherent immigration policyOPINIONPresident Biden proposed humane immigration reforms but continued harsh, Trump-era enforcement policies at the border. There is a growing gulf between the progressive immigration values President Joe Biden professes and the enforcement policies he’s implementing at the border — and it’s led to confusion among immigration officials, uncertainty for migrants, and questions about whether the president has a coherent strategy on immigration at all. On the campaign trail, Biden promised a more humane approach to the southern border than former President Donald Trump, whom he described as launching an “unrelenting assault on our values and...
__label__3 American Medical Association Faces Backlash for Calling to Remove Sex From Birth CertificatesThe American Medical Association (AMA), the largest organization of physicians and medical students in the United States, came under fire over the weekend for a recent proposal calling to end the designation of sex on birth certificates. The proposal (pdf), which was adopted by the AMA’s Board of Trustees in June, states that recording the baby’s sex on the public portion of birth certificates, as has always been the case, has “potential for discrimination.” “Our American Medical Association will advocate for the removal of sex as a legal designation on the public...
__label__1 Potential military vaccine mandate brings distrust, supportSince President Joe Biden asked the Pentagon last week to look at adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the military’s mandatory shots, former Army lawyer Greg T. Rinckey has fielded a deluge of calls. His firm, Tully Rinckey, has heard from hundreds of soldiers, Marines and sailors wanting to know their rights and whether they could take any legal action if ordered to get inoculated for the coronavirus. “A lot of U.S. troops have reached out to us saying, ‘I don’t want a vaccine that’s untested, I’m not sure it’s safe,...
__label__5 220+ Groups Blast Biden Plan to Expand 'Harmful, Abusive, and Unjust' ICE PrisonsMore than 220 human rights groups on Friday sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas expressing their outrage over the administration's plans to reopen and expand immigration detention centers in violation of the president's campaign promises. The groups—which include Detention Watch Network, the Shut Down Berks Coalition, JUNTOS, National Immigrant Justice Center, the ACLU, and CASA—are demanding that the administration halt the planned expansion of the privately run Berks County Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Pennsylvania and the reopening of the Moshannon Valley...
__label__3 Biden Claims Hospitals Could Run Out of Beds Due to Coronavirus SurgeANALYSISCLAIM: A coronavirus surge means that “if someone else has a heart attack, or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.” VERDICT: PROBABLY FALSE. Hospitals did not run out of beds during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will require all federal employees, and employees of federal contractors, to be vaccinated for coronavirus, or else submit to regular testing and be required to wear masks. He proposed an incentive of $100 to encourage unvaccinated people to...
__label__2 The Dam Is Breaking on Vaccine MandatesANALYSISIT DIDN’T NEED to be this way. This spring, as people lined up for newly available, miraculously effective Covid-19 vaccines, it was easy to imagine a direct and speedy path to a protected society. The curve of administered doses appeared limited only by the supply, and the curve was looking good—perfectly calibrated for things to be normal (at least by some definition of the word) by the end of summer, just in time for schools and workplaces to reopen. So long as the vaccination rate kept pace.  Which, of course, it didn’t. Much...
__label__5 ‘People will always come’: Inside a Haitian’s journey without endThe scene has played out over and over again at the southern border since January: Cross the river, find a shaded spot and wait for Border Patrol to arrive so you can surrender. The difference this time was tens of thousands of people followed the script at a scale and magnitude no one imagined or was ready for. Among them is a young Haitian named Paulnick “Nicko” Archelus, 28, and the woman he met on the journey, Nayou Jean-Pierre, who is 25. Nicko and Nayou were among the many to...

__label__2 Carrot vs. stick: What can convince the unvaccinated?As the rate of COVID-19 cases continues to tick upward throughout the United States, some lawmakers, public health officials and opinion writers have started to express a new level of frustration with the millions of Americans who have not gotten the vaccine. “Folks supposed to have common sense,” Alabama’s Republican Gov. Kay Ivey told reporters last week. “But it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks.” After peaking at more than 3 million doses administered per day in April, the daily vaccination rate in the U.S. has dropped...
__label__5 Trump Is Gone, But the US Is Still Putting Migrants Through HellOPINION“Texas is playing by its own rules on immigration and deputizing police from as far away as Iowa to participate in Abbott’s state-level war on migrants. The implications here are just horrifying,” says Kelly Hayes. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Kelly examines recent events in Del Rio, Texas, where Black asylum seekers were brutalized and faced mass deportations, and also highlights Operation Lone Star, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s unconstitutional, state-level war on migrants. Kelly also talks with Breanne Palmer, with the UndocuBlack Network, and Kevin Herrera, with Just Futures...
__label__3 Poll finds 71% of Americans oppose vaccine mandatesThe American people are overwhelmingly opposed to vaccine mandates and believe that the decision on whether to get vaccinated against COVID-19 should be a "personal choice," according to a new national survey. A nationwide issues survey of likely general election voters conducted by the Trafalgar Group in partnership with Convention of States Action found that 71.4% of respondents said taking COVID-19 vaccines should be a personal choice. Just 21.8% said vaccination should be mandatory, while 6.8% were unsure. Rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.S. have in recent...
__label__2 Why some people don't want a Covid-19 vaccineANALYSISThere should be no doubt about it: Covid-19 vaccines are saving lives. Consider some recent statistics from the UK. In a study tracking more than 200,000 people, nearly every single participant had developed antibodies against the virus within two weeks of their second dose. And despite initial worries that the current vaccines may be less effective against the Delta variant, analyses suggest that both the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs reduce hospitalisation rates by 92-96%. As many health practitioners have repeated, the risks of severe side effects from a vaccine are tiny in comparison...
__label__5 U.S. officials think massive surge at southern border possible if Covid restriction is lifted ThursdayU.S. officials are quietly preparing for what they think could be the biggest surge in traffic at the southern border in decades if a Covid restriction that has blocked most migrants for almost two years is lifted Thursday. On a call this week with senior Department of Homeland Security officials, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas asked whether the department was prepared for a worst-case scenario in which 350,000 to 400,000 migrants cross the border in October, according to two DHS officials familiar with the conversation. A number that high would nearly double the 21-year...
__label__3 Democrats’ Reckless Medicare ExpansionANALYSISInstead of fixing our broken entitlements, Democrats want to make them more generous than socialist Canada’s. When the United States entered World War II and rapidly ramped up military production, it drove debt to its largest share of the economy in the nation’s history. But as the crisis ended, that spending wound down, and debt returned to more sustainable levels. What is happening now is something quite different. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the U.S. was already on an unsustainable fiscal path, primarily as a result of spending on entitlements....
__label__2 CDC: Northwest heat wave led to major spike in emergency room visitsThe unprecedented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest led to a major spike in emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses, according to a report published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why it matters: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S. during a typical year, and climate change is dramatically raising the risk of such events. Multiple all-time temperature records were shattered during the late June into early July heat wave in the Pacific Northwest. During the event, Seattle hit an all-time record high of 108°F, while Portland hit...

Gustavo, a Honduran man, sat them on the steps of the bridge and crossed the street to buy them something to eat. He remembers that a car approached him as he walked those steps. “They put me in the car. The children stayed there, waiting for me, but I didn’t come back.” He had been kidnapped. Days later, on the same bridge, Jorge Geovanni Díaz, also...
__label__3 Cruz Spars With Homeland Security Secretary Over ‘Biden Cages’ For Migrant ChildrenSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) clashed Tuesday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over conditions for migrant children at border detention centers. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz referred to the border facilities housing migrant children as “Biden cages.” “How many children have been in the Biden cages in calendar year 2021?” Cruz asked Mayorkas. “Senator, I respectfully disagree with your use of the term ‘cages,'” Mayorkas responded. “Fine, you can disagree with it,” Cruz answered. “How many children have been in the Biden cages? I’ve been to the Biden cages, I’ve...
__label__2 What are President Biden's challenges at the border?US President Joe Biden entered the White House promising to tackle immigration challenges that have remained unsolved for decades. Yet since he took office in January, the US has seen a record influx of migrants at its southern border, prompting criticism of the administration's policies from across the political spectrum. Some two million "encounters" between government agents and migrants near the border are expected by the end of 2021, Mr Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told US senators on Tuesday - including about 125,000 unaccompanied minors who have already...
__label__4 Biden in a bind on the border: 'The politics finally got the better of their policy'Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, called the Border Patrol “egregious and white supremacist.” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said it was “worse than what we witnessed in slavery.” The pair spent years targeting similar criticism at former President Donald Trump for his handling of the border. But this time, they were talking about fellow Democrat President Joe Biden's administration, which continues to deport Haitian migrants and others seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border under a controversial Trump-era public health order. Trump polarized the politics of immigration in a way...
__label__3 CBP reports 164K illegal immigrant stops in October, more than double from 2020More than 164,000 people were apprehended last month while attempting to illegally cross the US-Mexico border, according to US Customs and Border Protection — more than twice the number who were apprehended in the same month last year.The 164,303 encounters recorded by CBP represent a 14 percent decrease from September and a 23 percent decrease from July, when 213,593 migrants were apprehended — the highest total in 21 years.
__label__2 What’s happening at the U.S.-Mexico border in 7 chartsThe U.S. Border Patrol reported more than 1.6 million encounters with migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2021 fiscal year, more than quadruple the number of the prior fiscal year and the highest annual total on record. The number of encounters had fallen to just over 400,000 in fiscal 2020 as the coronavirus outbreak slowed migration across much of the world. But encounters at the southwest border rebounded sharply in fiscal 2021 and ultimately eclipsed the previous annual high recorded in fiscal 2000, according to recently published data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the federal...
__label__3 Biden slips into political quicksand amid Haitian migrant buildupANALYSISThe mass of thousands of Haitians at the U.S. southern border has put the Biden administration in the exact place it’s tried to avoid: knee deep in immigration politics. In the past 24 hours, the White House has responded to images and videos of aggressive tactics used by Border Patrol agents to corral those migrants by supporting an internal investigation into the matter. What it hasn’t done, yet, is figure out a solution to the crowding and sanitary issues arising in what’s become a makeshift encampment — or stop its policy of...
__label__1 Border crossings by Haitian migrants plunged in October, CBP data showThe number of Haitian migrants attempting to cross into the United States fell by more than 90 percent in October after the Biden administration aggressively ramped up its use of deportation flights, according to preliminary U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Washington Post. CBP figures show about 1,000 Haitians were taken into custody along the Mexico border last month, down from 17,638 in September, when huge crowds waded across the Rio Grande to a makeshift camp in Del Rio, Tex., creating a humanitarian and political crisis for...
__label__5 Poland blocks hundreds of migrants at Belarus borderPoland says it has repelled attempts by migrants to enter the country at its eastern border with Belarus, warning that thousands more were on the way. Video footage showed hundreds of people near a barbed-wire border fence, which some tried to force their way through. The Polish government called a crisis meeting on Monday and deployed 12,000 troops to the region. Poland has accused Belarus of pushing the migrants towards the border, describing it as hostile activity. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia say there's been a surge in the number of...

__label__2 Biden Admin Detaining Migrants Outdoors Under Texas Border Bridge Again in Winter WeatherThe Biden administration reopened the infamous outdoor detention area that once held 15,000 mostly Haitian migrants for processing and transport. According to a source within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol officials detained more than 100 mostly Central American migrants under the Del Rio International Bridge on Saturday as overnight temperatures fell into the low 50s. The source, not authorized to speak to the media, told Breitbart Texas some 1,500 migrants are also being detained in temporary holding cells at several Border Patrol stations within the Del Rio, Sector....
__label__4 Biden trying again to end "Remain in Mexico" policyThe Department of Homeland Security is issuing a memo Thursday announcing its intent to end the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy, DHS officials told reporters on a call. Why it matters: The Biden administration is currently under a court order to reimplement the policy, which is formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). The controversial program requires many migrants to remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed in U.S. courts. Human rights advocates have slammed MPP as inhumane. Catch up quick: The Biden administration first tried to end the program in June, but a U.S....
__label__3 More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report saysMore and more people are identifying as members of the LGBTQ community. Increased visibility educates non-LGBTQ people, but it also comes with a purported price, according to GLAAD's annual Accelerating Acceptance Study out Wednesday. The report found that 43% of non-LGBTQ people think gender is not exclusively male and female, up from 38% in 2020. And 81% of non-LGBTQ people anticipate nonbinary and transgender people will become as familiar in everyday life as gay and lesbian people have. "Our community continues to grow, and we're seeing some growing acceptance of that," says Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD CEO. "We...
__label__2 Venezuelans eclipse Central Americans in Border Patrol custody, highlighting scale of crisisMore Venezuelans were in the custody of the Border Patrol at the end of October than any other nationality of migrants, an indication of the extremely high numbers of displaced South Americans are flocking to the United States amid the Biden administration’s lax border policies. Never before have Venezuelans arrived at the border at the current rates. Usually, Mexico or Central American nations top the list of countries with the most citizens in federal custody at the border. The mass arrival of migrants from other, more remote countries is an indication that...
__label__5 Want to solve America's labor shortage? Hire immigrants and foreignersOPINIONThe U.S. war on immigrants is worsening the labor shortage. But some Americans would rather destroy the supply chain and shutter industries than admit it – and do something about it. Evidence of scarce workers is everywhere. Shipping containers remained unopened from Los Angeles to Georgia. Restaurants, hotels, trucking and other industries are begging for workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that “employers are struggling to fill more than 10 million job openings and meet soaring consumer demand.” Industries hardest hit by a record number of workers quitting include manufacturing, retail, trade, transportation and utilities. And those workers...

Come on, man,” said Mr. Brown, a security guard headed home from work at 1:30 a.m. Expressing his annoyance was all it took. The officer yelled at Mr. Brown, ordered him out of the car and threw him to the pavement. After a trip to jail that night in 2018, hands cuffed and blood...
__label__1 House GOP introducing bill to block reported Biden plan to pay illegal immigrants up to $450KRepublicans in the House on Thursday will introduce a bill to block a reported plan by the Biden administration to pay millions of dollars to illegal immigrants separated under the Trump administration – as President Biden has sought to dismiss the reports. Rep. Tom McClintock, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, will introduce the Illegal Immigration Payoff Prohibition Act, which amends 18 USC 2414 – which gives the attorney general the authority to enter settlement agreements. The bill would block the attorney general from making any settlement payments...
__label__5 The U.S.-Mexico Border - Where Reality Clashes With American IdealismOPINIONThe continuing migrant saga at the U.S.—Mexico border seems to have boxed the Biden Administration into a corner where it is not effectively and humanely dealing with migrants. Instead, the migrants are being turned away by two Biden enforced immigration policies that originated under previous administrations. The first is the "Remain in Mexico" policy that requires migrants to stay in Mexico until their U.S. immigration court date. This policy enables migrants to make a claim to asylum in the United States, but requires them to await the determination of the...
__label__3 “What Exactly Is the Plan for Us?”OPINIONMary Baliker, a 58-year-old kidney transplant recipient living in Middleton, Wisconsin, is no stranger to blood tests. But this one was different. As part of a clinical study on antibody responses, she has been periodically FedEx-ing her blood to Johns Hopkins, where doctors have been looking for immune responses to the Moderna vaccine. Because she takes immunosuppressive drugs so her body doesn’t reject the donated organ, it wasn’t very likely that the vaccine would prompt the immune response it is supposed to. Nevertheless, she held out hope. When the final...
__label__2 How Biden Responded When Asked About Plan to Give $450K to Illegal ImmigrantsPresident Biden on Sunday was asked about the administration’s plan to pay illegal immigrants who had been separated from their families under the Trump administration $450,000 per person. Instead of responding, Biden just scratched his head. "Mr. President, is it true we're going to give $450,000 to border crossers who are separated?" Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked the president as he rode down an escalator at the G20 summit.  Instead of responding, Biden gave a blank stare and scratched his head.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the payments could total...

__label__2 More Than Half of America’s 100 Richest People Exploit Special Trusts to Avoid Estate TaxesIt’s well known, at least among tax lawyers and accountants for the ultrawealthy: The estate tax can be easily avoided by exploiting a loophole unwittingly created by Congress three decades ago. By using special trusts, a rarefied group of Americans has taken advantage of this loophole, reducing government revenues and fueling inequality. There is no way for the public to know who uses these special trusts aside from when they’ve been disclosed in lawsuits or securities filings. There’s also been no way to quantify just how much in estate tax...
__label__2 Washington Post fact-checker calls asking about Biden visiting the border 'a bit of a gotcha question'Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler seemed to dismiss the ongoing inquires of whether or not President Biden has gone to the southern border and if he has any intention of visiting in the future.  Biden raised eyebrows on Thursday at CNN's town hall when he was asked by an attendee why he hadn't been to the southern border as president.  He responded by saying he had "been there before" but admitted "I guess I should go down" before pointing to his busy schedule that has prevented the visit and touting a trip to the border...
__label__5 How much blame does Biden shoulder for immigration struggles?When President Biden took office, he vowed to “undo the moral and national shame” of the Trump administration’s hard-line approach to immigration. But in the intervening months, though Biden has reversed some of the most controversial policies, he has kept others in place — a tactic that has led to criticism from both the left and the right. The dynamic came to a head last week in response to the administration’s treatment of Haitian migrants who had gathered at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum. Immigration advocates and progressive members of...
__label__3 Could sweeping changes be coming to immigration laws? Advocates hope budget bill is the answerWASHINGTON – For decades, lawmakers and immigrant advocates have been working to pass immigration reform on Capitol Hill, often looking to pass bipartisan legislation to extend protections and pathways to citizenship for farmworkers and those who are undocumented. Success has been elusive, but advocates and some members of Congress see the $3.5 trillion budget bill that Democrats and President Joe Biden want to pass this fall as one of their best bets of passing sweeping changes to the nation's immigration laws.  Democrats are hoping to include in the bill pathways to...

__label__4 Del Rio bridge camp empty following Haitian migrant surgeThe last migrants camping under the Del Rio International Bridge, which connects Texas and Mexico, departed on Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced during a White House press briefing. Driving the news: Thousands of migrants, mostly from Haiti, had arrived to the makeshift camp after crossing the southern border seeking asylum. Roughly 1,800 migrants will now head to U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing centers. Many migrants face expulsion because they are not covered by the protections the Biden administration extended to Haitians already in the country.

A federal judge ordered the Biden administration to reinstate the policy in August after requests by the Texas and Missouri attorneys general, according to CBS News. The Biden administration criticized the “Remain in Mexico” policy that left 70,000 migrants who weren’t from Mexico to wait in Mexican border towns until their U.S. asylum hearings. The Biden administration is now legally required to abide by the judge’s August order “in good faith,”...
__label__5 What’s behind the growing gap between men and women in college completion?DATAThe growing gender gap in higher education – both in enrollment and graduation rates – has been a topic of conversation and debate in recent months. Young women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, and among those ages 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have a four-year college degree. The gap in college completion is even wider among younger adults ages 25 to 34. Women’s educational gains have occurred alongside their growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy. The implications...
__label__3 Is There Racism in the Deed to Your Home?Last year, to celebrate the centennial of their charming Craftsman home, Kyona and Kenneth Zak repainted it in historically accurate colors — gray, bronze green and copper red. They commissioned beveled-glass windows to complement the original stained glass. And they visited the San Diego County Recorder, to have a line drawn through a sentence in their deed that once would have prohibited Ms. Zak, who is Black, from owning the home. “I’ve referred to it as the ultimate smudge stick to the house,” said Ms. Zak, an ayurvedic health counselor...
__label__2 How Biden Has Misled Americans About The Situation At The Southern BorderANALYSISPresident Joe Biden and his administration have misled Americans about the situation at the southern border multiple times since taking office, according to Customs and Border Protection data and various media reports. Biden refused to call the influx of migrants at the southern border a “crisis” in April. He has called it a seasonal surge that happens “every single solitary year.” Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data suggested otherwise. In March of this year, CBP saw a 400% increase when compared to the same period in 2020. Record breaking apprehensions continued throughout the spring and...
__label__5 Wanted, due to supply chain shortages: used crutches, walkers and canesFrom Utah to South Carolina and Kentucky, hospitals and charities are asking for gently used crutches, canes and walkers. Supplies are getting harder to come by thanks to — let’s all say it together — supply chain problems. The main issue seems to be the unreliable supply of aluminum, which is used to make the products. In Bluffton, South Carolina, Beaufort Memorial Hospital put out a plea: “The impacts of the global pandemic continue to affect so many aspects of healthcare,” BMH president and CEO Russell Baxley said in a...
__label__3 Nearly half of American workers don’t earn enough to afford a one-bedroom rentalNearly half of American workers do not earn enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment, according to new data. Rents in the US continued to increase through the pandemic, and a worker now needs to earn about $20.40 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom rental. The median wage in the US is about $21 an hour. The data, from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, shows that millions of Americans – from Amazon warehouse workers to cab drivers to public school teachers – are struggling to pay rent. For the poorest Americans,...
__label__2 U.S. Officials Quietly Preparing For ‘350,000 to 400,000’ Migrant Encounters At Mexico Border In October: ReportThe Biden administration’s Department of Homeland Security is quietly gearing up for a surge of “350,000 to 400,000” migrants in the month of October, according to a report from NBC News, and believe the border could see a huge influx of activity if the Title 42 COVID restriction on asylum lifts on Friday. Title 42, instituted during the Trump administration, allows the federal government to “expel” immigrants, including asylum seekers, back to their home country without a hearing, over concerns that they could contribute to the spread of COVID-19. The...
__label__5 United States issues its 1st passport with ‘X’ gender markerThe United States has issued its first passport with an “X” gender designation, marking a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who do not identify as male or female, and expects to be able to offer the option more broadly next year, the State Department said Wednesday. The department did not identify the passport recipient, but Dana Zzyym of Fort Collins, Colorado, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview it was their passport. Zzyym, who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun, has been in a legal battle with...
__label__3 CEO pay at big companies rose nearly 19% last year to $24 million, report findsThe chief executives at major U.S. corporations received millions of dollars in bonuses or raises last year even as many companies saw slumping sales and job cuts because of the pandemic, a new analysis shows. CEO compensation at the top 350 companies jumped nearly 19% in 2020 to an average $24.2 million, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank. By comparison, pay for rank-and-file workers last year rose roughly 4%. The typical corporate leader at big companies in 2020 made $351 for every dollar earned by a typical employee,...
__label__2 Immigration protesters block traffic on Golden Gate bridge, demand 'pathway to citizenship'Immigration protesters stopped traffic on San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge for more than 30 minutes Thursday morning, urging Congress to pass a citizenship bill through the budget reconciliation process. "Immigrant communities cannot wait another 20 years of failed promises. An inclusive pathway to citizenship would boost the U.S. economy. As the Center for American Progress reports, a pathway to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants would increase U.S. gross domestic product by a cumulative total of $1.7 trillion over 10 years, create 438,800 new jobs, and increase wages for undocumented and American workers. The...
__label__5 This arthritis drug cost $198 in 2008. Now it's more than $10,000In 2008, a box of 30 anti-inflammatory rectal suppositories that treats arthritis, called Indocin, had a price tag of $198. As of Oct. 1, the price of that same box was 52 times higher, totaling $10,350. Why it matters: As federal lawmakers continue to waver on drug price reforms, Indocin is another example of how nothing prevents drug companies from hiking prices at will and selling them within a broken supply chain. Driving the news: Indocin has changed ownership multiple times over the years, and the companies involved have controversial histories. Iroko Pharmaceuticals,...
__label__2 What critical race theory is — and isn’t — and why it belongs in schoolsOPINIONRace is a touchy subject in this country at the most easygoing of times, and these are not the most easygoing of times. The issue is especially fraught as the nation struggles to come to some kind of racial reckoning after the murder of George Floyd, who died under the knee of a white police officer. It’s not surprising, then, that a renewed call for ethnic studies in public schools has caused a nationwide wave of contentious school board meetings, with opponents of such courses hurling accusations of indoctrination and in some...
__label__2 'Enough Is Enough': Border County Votes to Sue Joe Biden for Failing to Protect Southern BorderVal Verde County, Texas announced on Tuesday they will be forming a coalition with other counties and cities along the U.S.-Mexico border to sue President Joe Biden over his disastrous handling of the ongoing illegal immigration crisis. The unanimous vote comes after the city of Del Rio, which is located in Val Verde County, saw a massive surge of mostly Haitians illegally enter the United States, overwhelming Border Patrol and local law enforcement. Because Border Patrol facilities were already over capacity, they had to place the illegal immigrants underneath the international...
__label__5 Should there be special programs for gifted students?New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday announced a plan to gradually eliminate his city’s program for gifted and talented students in K-12 schools. Starting next fall, the nation’s largest school district will no longer admit incoming kindergartners into special gifted classes or schools. Instead, accelerated learning will be made accessible to all students in their own schools. The impending change comes after years of criticism of the racial makeup of students in the city’s gifted and talented program. About 75 percent of the 16,000 students in New York’s gifted...
__label__3 The Bad Science Behind Trans Healthcare BansANALYSISConservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas. “We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of HB 1570, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children. After a vote, Arkansas became the first state...
__label__1 Amnesty Is Unfair to Legal Immigrants Like MeOPINIONLawmakers in Congress are still trying to use their $3.5 trillion spending bill to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens — even after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that their initial proposal was ineligible for inclusion, due to the complex rules surrounding the filibuster-proof budget “reconciliation” process that Democrats are using to pass their agenda on a strict party-line vote. Their latest strategy involves updating a registry to allow illegal aliens who arrived after 1972 — the current registry cutoff — to seek green cards. Depending on the new date they set, this...
__label__5 At police lines, not all journalists are created equalOPINIONFor a lot of journalism’s history, BIPOC experiences have been told through a white lens. Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...
__label__3 A Thousand Coal Miners Are Still On Strike After 4 MonthsMichael Argo has spent 13 years working underground at a coal mine in Brookwood, Alabama, just outside Tuscaloosa. It’s the same mine his father worked at, raising Argo on good union wages and excellent health care coverage. When Argo followed in his father’s footsteps, he believed the job would get better with time and seniority. Instead, he said the job has only gotten worse. “I’m working more than I ever have, and I’m making less money,” said Argo, a 33-year-old longwall miner who logs 10- to 12-hour days, 20 miles...
__label__1 Border Patrol Breaks All-Time Migrant Apprehension Record in 2021With less than 48 hours left in Fiscal Year 2021, the Border Patrol has already surpassed the total number of migrant apprehensions made in any year along the southwest border since the agency’s inception in 1924. A source within Customs and Border Protection notes the unofficial apprehension record shows more than 1,646,000 for the year as of Wednesday. The total reflects arrests made within the nine southwest Border Patrol Sectors from California to Texas. According to CBP, the previous record stood since 2000 when 1,643,679 were arrested. The source says the final...
__label__4 Congress is trying, again, to end hunger in the militaryIn 2016, Erika Tebbens was living outside Seattle, one of the most expensive places in America, trying to feed a family of three on her husband’s enlisted sailor's salary of less than $25,000 a year. Tebbens said she did not qualify for Agriculture Department nutrition assistance because of a rule that military personnel include in their income any housing allowance they receive. That same rule was a big reason a Pentagon poverty assistance program that started in 2000 failed to help many servicemembers and was discontinued in 2016.
__label__3 The Void That Critical Race Theory Was Created to FillOPINIONIn 1971, Derrick Bell, a forty-year-old civil-rights attorney, became the first Black professor to gain tenure at Harvard Law School. A soft-spoken and prolific scholar, with glasses and a short fro coming to a widow’s peak, Bell was a Pittsburgh native and Air Force veteran who, before his career in academia, had worked with Thurgood Marshall composing legal strategies against school segregation in the South, at the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, and as the deputy director of civil rights at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. At Harvard,...
__label__1 DHS chief says 1 in 5 migrants have ‘illness’ after Del Rio fiascoHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday that the “rate of illness” among illegal immigrants who have arrived at the US-Mexico border in recent months is “approximately 20 percent” — days after admitting that thousands of Haitian migrants who set up a temporary encampment under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas were not tested for COVID-19. “When one is speaking of 7,000 or 7,500 people encountered at the border every day, if one takes a look at that system, it is not built for that in a COVID environment where isolation is...
__label__5 Top 1% dodge $163 billion in annual taxes, Treasury estimatesThe top 1% of Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in annual taxes, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  This estimate widens the so-called tax gap — the shortfall between how much is owed and collected — to $600 billion every year, the report outlines. The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...
__label__3 John Oliver Makes One Of The Most Compelling Cases Yet For ReparationsANALYSISJohn Oliver on Sunday night pushed for reparations for Black Americans. “We’re not actually talking about reparations for slavery here. We should, but that is a different conversation,” he said. “We’re talking about housing discrimination.”  Homeownership, he pointed out, has been so defined by racism that many communities still have laws that forbid the sale of homes to people of color. And entire communities are still living with the legacy of real estate tactics from a not-too-distant past, such as redlining, blockbusting and overt discrimination in federal home loans. “The only...
__label__1 Abandoned IDs Show Haitian Migrants Held Chilean Refugee StatusA number of Haitian migrants at the U.S. southern border held refugee status in Chile, abandoned ID cards viewed by the Daily Caller show. More than 15,000 migrants camped under the Del Rio Bridge in Del Rio, Texas, before the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cleared the camps on Friday, sending the migrants to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing centers along the southern border. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said that “a minority of the individuals” will be allowed to remain in the U.S. following deportation hearings.
__label__5 Hate crimes against Asian and Black people rise sharply in the U.S., FBI saysThe number of reported hate crimes nationwide against Asian and Black people sharply increased in 2020, according to new FBI data released Monday. Hate crimes targeting people of Asian descent rose by a whopping 70% last year compared with the number of such incidents in 2019, the FBI said. That increase coincided with the outbreak in the United States of the Covid-19 pandemic, which some racists have unjustly blamed on Asian Americans because of the coronavirus’ origin in China. Rhetoric attacking the Chinese government from former President Donald Trump and his allies...
__label__3 Apple Has a Growing Homeless Encampment on Its PropertyApple has committed billions of dollars to fixing California’s housing crisis. But clusters of homeless people living in dilapidated RVs, shacks, and tents have taken over dozens of acres of undeveloped land owned by the company in the center of Silicon Valley. There’s even dumpsters and porta-potties.  Anywhere from 30 to 100 homeless people have coalesced on the property owned by the iPhone-maker in North San Jose, according to local sources and residents. The area covers about 55 acres, KPIX, a local CBS affiliate, reported. Some current residents of the site, which has grown...
__label__2 Psaki Announces Del Rio Border Patrol Will No Longer Use Horses in Response to False ‘Whip’ NarrativeWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki announced Thursday that Border Patrol agents will no longer be permitted to use horses to guard the border in Del Rio, Texas, after “horrific” photos emerged of agents swinging long reins while interacting with Haitian migrants. The announcement comes after the media caused a frenzy by falsely portraying the videos and photos as showing agents hitting the migrants with whips. It was later revealed that the agents were in fact wielding the long reins that make it easier to maintain control of their horses, according to...
__label__4 Biden administration launches new office focused on climate change and healthOn Monday, the Biden administration announced the establishment of a new office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that will specifically address climate change and its effects, focusing on how it affects public health. The office will be called the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE). In a video announcement on Twitter, one critical goal of the office will focus on health equity and address the disparities Americans of color suffer regarding the impacts of climate change.  “There is no doubt that America is experiencing climate...
__label__3 How Tucker Carlson became the voice of White grievanceOPINIONTucker Carlson huddled in a low-ceilinged dungeon that had served as a holding pen for Africans bound for enslavement in the United States. It was a July day in 2003 in Ghana, and Carlson stood alongside some of America’s most prominent civil rights leaders. The conservative commentator, who at the time co-hosted the CNN show “Crossfire,” walked through the memorial, where a guide told how the shackled Africans who did not perish during the voyage were sold as human chattel in America. The civil rights leaders prayed, cried and sang...
__label__1 Inflating Grades For Social JusticeOPINIONAt a party over the weekend I was introduced to a college professor, and fell into conversation with him about teaching and Covid. Then I asked about how wokeness affects his teaching. I had no idea of the man’s politics, but I would bet the farm that he is a liberal, given that his academic field skews heavily to the left. He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...
__label__5 Vaccine mandates exacerbate class divideCorporate America's patchwork approach to vaccine requirements is deepening the pandemic's class divides. Why it matters: New cases of coronavirus, driven by the Delta variant, are up 86% in the U.S. over the past two weeks. The rise in new infections has upended return to work plans for certain sectors of the economy, while others can't afford to change course. State of play: Businesses that can and have operated remotely, like those in tech and financial services, are requiring vaccines for returning workers, while service and retail economy companies have stopped short...
__label__3 How the rich avoid paying taxesANALYSISIn the US, most people make their money from a regular job; they get a paycheck and pay income taxes. But the richest Americans, the top 1 percent, make most of their money from things like investments in real estate or the stock market. Those investments are taxed as capital gains. While federal income tax has a maximum tax rate of 37 percent, the tax rate for capital gains tops out at just 20 percent. It’s why Warren Buffett, one of the richest people in America, has often said that...
__label__2 Biden’s Chief Of Staff Agrees: Inflation A ‘High-Class Problem’ANALYSISOn Wednesday night, President Biden’s White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, apparently sympathetic with the infamous quote attributed to 18th century French Queen Marie Antoinette, “Let them eat cake” regarding starving plebeians, agreed that the current inflation was a “high-class problem.” Klain echoed the claim of the former chairman of former President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman, who tweeted, “Most of the economic problems we’re facing (inflation, supply chains, etc.) are high-class problems. We wouldn’t have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent....
__label__5 A timely lesson from a tiny town long agoANALYSISRecently, a friend gave me the book “A Stronger Kinship” by historian Anna-Lisa Cox. It tells of Covert, Michigan, a small town 30 miles from my friend’s childhood home.  His nearly all-white high school had played them in sports, yet only now was he learning that more than a century ago, Black and white residents of Covert had “lived as equal citizens,” as the book puts it.  As far back as the 1860s, they treated each other as neighbors regardless of race, farming side by side. Black men not only...
__label__3 When Your Body Counts But Your Vote Does Not: How Prison Gerrymandering Distorts Political RepresentationANALYSISWhen Floyd Wilson first learned of the term “prison gerrymandering,” he’d already been incarcerated for more than 35 years. He was taking a college seminar in a prison in Graterford, Pennsylvania—the fourth of five correctional facilities he’s lived in over the decades. Wilson grew up in Southwest Philadelphia and was sentenced to life in prison in 1976 as a juvenile for first degree murder. In every U.S. census that’s taken place since his conviction, he learned that day in class, he’s been counted not as a Philadelphian but as a...
__label__1 Asian Americans Disprove CRTOPINIONAccording to the illiberal race-hustlers among us, America is a thoroughly racist nation where you only succeed if (and because) you are white. Therefore, we need government to coercively redistribute wealth and allocate important positions by racial quotas. Only through such measures can we attain “equity.” That theory collapses when examined with any care. A person’s race or ancestry has nothing to do with his success or failure in life. In today’s Martin Center article, Kenny Xu demolishes critical race theory by pointing out that Asian Americans have enjoyed great success...
__label__5 Poll: Women of color highly motivated to voteWomen of color turned out to vote at record rates in the 2020 election, with almost nine in 10 agreeing that the stakes were too high not to vote, according to a new poll. Why it matters: The findings in the poll, conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of a group of reproductive justice organizations, appear to confirm the highly-motivated voting bloc's emerging power. Advocates warn that the GOP's efforts to restrict voting access, including targeting vote by mail and early voting, will disproportionately impact people of color. By the numbers: Eight in 10 women...
__label__3 Women Are Having Fewer Babies Because They Have More ChoicesOPINIONAmerican women are having fewer children and having them later than ever before — a demographic shift being met with significant consternation from the left and right alike.For conservatives, the fact that more women are putting off parenthood or forgoing it entirely is evidence of a dangerous decline in traditional family values. In this framing, women have been manipulated into putting their educational and professional aspirations ahead of motherhood, contributing to a broader cultural breakdown.

__label__5 Inmates are Dying in Connecticut's Prisons Due to Medical NegligenceStaff shortages, widespread mismanagement and poor quality of care has caused medical negligence that has led to inmates dying in Connecticut's prisons, even well after medical workers have been alerted of their illnesses. On July 8, state officials agreed to pay the family of 19-year-old Karon Nealy $1.65 million. An inmate in a Connecticut prison, Nealy died in July 2015 from complications from lupus. Connecticut is the only U.S. state where its Department of Correction (DOC) runs its prison medical system and lawyers have argued that a mismanagement of this...
__label__3 Democrats cite Ku Klux Klan Act in suits over ‘Trump Train’ Texas bus incidentA convoy of Trump supporters that swarmed a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a Texas highway last October violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibits violent election intimidation, two new lawsuits allege. One suit targets drivers in the self-described “Trump Train”, saying they conspired to intimidate and harass Biden-Harris campaigners. The other suit names as defendants law enforcement officials in San Marcos, Texas, saying they “abdicated” their responsibility to protect the bus “despite repeated calls for help”. The lawsuits were filed by Eric Cervini, an author and volunteer; Wendy Davis, a former Texas state...
__label__1 Economic Freedom Best Path to Women’s Equality, EmpowermentOPINIONWomen’s battle for equal rights under the law has progressed significantly in a number of countries, but many other nations still have much room for improvement to establish societies that uphold women’s equality and dignity. So, what’s the solution to decreasing this gender gap worldwide? There’s considerable evidence that the best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The World Bank Group’s Women, Business and the Law 2021 annual report outlines the importance of gender equality for women’s...
__label__4 Mississippi only state with no elected LGBTQ official: reportMississippi is the only state in the U.S. with no known out LGBTQ elected official serving, according to a new annual report by The LGBTQ Victory Institute.  Nationwide, LGBTQ elected officials increased by 17 percent in the last year, with 986 currently serving, according to the report. Eighty-four percent of all LGBTQ elected officials are Democrats while just 3 percent are Republicans.  Annise Parker, the institute's president and CEO, acknowledged the partisan divide among LGBTQ officials to The New York Times. "There are more trans elected officials than there are out Republican elected officials," she...
__label__3 Pride merch won’t save trans youthANALYSISJust before the start of Pride Month, Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, began selling a wide variety of rainbow-themed merchandise. A perusal of the company’s website reveals hundreds of such items for sale, like a Queer Eye-branded clothing line and tie-ins from rainbow-themed brands like Skittles and the Kellogg Company. You can even buy a shirt that reads: “I can’t even think straight.” Walmart earned a perfect 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, which scores companies based on their support of LGBTQ employees through HR policies,...
__label__1 America’s Class War Over AbortionOPINIONOn Thursday, the state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade. “Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong,” the state said in a brief submitted to the Court. “The conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition.” Mississippi was laying out its arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case that presents the best opportunity since Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) to unravel America’s abortion regime. Mississippi attorney general Lynn Fitch could have stopped short of asking for the reversal of Roe. But she...
__label__5 Governments created an informational black hole for Indigenous communities and COVID-19ANALYSISWe may never know how many American Indians or Alaska Natives died of COVID-19. The Indian Health Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is not keeping track. The Centers for Disease Control cannot tell us. And some state health authorities will not disclose that data, despite multiple public records requests, even though it would shed light on the pandemic’s death toll in Indian Country. Earlier this year, the Indigenous Investigative Collective, a network of reporters from multiple outlets working collaboratively to investigate stories in Indigenous...
__label__3 America's Only LGBTQ Historic District Is Falling ApartANALYSISOne of North America’s first openly lesbian poets launched her career by pissing off H.P. Lovecraft. In 1918, at the age of 19, Elsa Gidlow started publishing North America’s first known LGBTQ-themed magazine out of her home in Montreal. Combining queer poetry, one-act plays about young gay love, and progressive social commentary, Les mouches fantastiques quickly gained a cult following far beyond the city and even Canada—culminating in a back-and-forth literary journal spat with the noted horror writer (and racist), who decried the magazine’s promotion of an “ancient selfish hedonism.” In 1920, Gidlow moved...
__label__2 AOC says Olympic ban on marijuana is 'instrument' of racism following Black track star's suspensionNew York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed Friday the rule barring marijuana use during the Olympic races was an "instrument of racist and colonial policy."  The congresswoman’s comments followed the announcement that U.S. champion Sha’Carri Richardson will not be running in the 100-meter race after she tested positive for THC, a chemical found in marijuana, at the Olympic trials – voiding her first-place results. Richardson, a Black woman from Texas, was given a one-month suspension, which precludes her ability to race the 100 in Tokyo but means she could still be in the running for...
__label__4 Cities grapple with homelessness, as tent clusters proliferateIt is nearly noon, and a Los Angeles sanitation crew is wrapping up dismantling the home of Jack Rivers. A yellow-vested worker rakes the narrow strip of dirt where the veteran’s tarp-covered dwelling once stood – part of a highly controversial homeless encampment of about 200 people jammed along the iconic boardwalk at Venice Beach. All morning, Mr. Rivers has been sorting his mounds of belongings, his head wrapped in a T-shirt to protect him from the sun. With a small crowd looking on, he flings a sweatshirt, pants, rolls of...
__label__3 More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report saysMore and more people are identifying as members of the LGBTQ community. Increased visibility educates non-LGBTQ people, but it also comes with a purported price, according to GLAAD's annual Accelerating Acceptance Study out Wednesday. The report found that 43% of non-LGBTQ people think gender is not exclusively male and female, up from 38% in 2020. And 81% of non-LGBTQ people anticipate nonbinary and transgender people will become as familiar in everyday life as gay and lesbian people have. "Our community continues to grow, and we're seeing some growing acceptance of that," says Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD CEO. "We...
__label__1 The Bias Narrative versus the Development Narrative: Thinking About Persistent Racial Inequality in the United StatesOPINIONLet me be as provocative as I can. I want to talk about the power of narratives to shape racial politics in this country. As we all know George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been duly convicted of murder by a jury of his peers. The cop was white and his victim black. But I have a question: Was it a racial incident? What would we mean if we said this was a racial incident, beyond the trivial statement that one participant was...
__label__5 What Science is MissingANALYSISChanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical physicist at the University of New Hampshire, is one of about 100 Black American women physicists, but she nearly left the field in her first semester in college. She isn't the only scientist of color who thought of giving up before her career began. Why it matters: Scientists and institutions have stepped up efforts in the year since George Floyd's murder to redress the underrepresentation of people like Prescod-Weinstein and other scientists of color among their ranks. That marginalization affects not only who pursues science as a career...
__label__3 Virginia governor election poised to cripple trans rights in AmericaOPINIONOn Tuesday, Virginia residents will go to the polls to elect state legislators and decide who will be the next occupant of the governor’s mansion. The race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor of the state, and Republican Glenn Youngkin has been closer than expected, with a bitter cultural battle taking center stage in the campaign. While much of the attention has gone to the nationalized moral panic over critical race theory, which explores America’s history of slavery and racial inequality and which conservatives have defined as teaching any...
__label__2 Report: Black, Latino voters reject radical far-left policies like 'defund the police'ANALYSISFar-left progressives who advocate radical criminal justice reform policies like "defund the police" claim abolishing traditional policing systems will benefit minority communities. But according to a New York Times report, Hispanic and black communities aren't buying what far-left Democrats are selling. The race to become New York City's next mayor has focused on crime and safety. Interestingly, Eric Adams, a former New York City Police captain who denounces radical anti-police policies, won a 10-point preliminary lead in the Democratic primary, which, though held last Tuesday, probably will not be officially determined...

Can it be fixed?Late one evening in October 2019, Don Baugh beached his kayak on the rocky shore of Pyne Poynt Park, a 15-acre postindustrial green space abutting a polluted backwater in Camden, New Jersey.

__label__3 Opinion on the use of puberty blockers in America is turningWorries about the use of puberty blockers, which are prescribed to some children to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (like breasts and facial hair) have been mounting in much of the rich world. Some countries have scaled back their use. Not America. Doctors who work in transgender clinics routinely claim that prescribing such drugs is conservative, because their effects are largely reversible, and compassionate, because they save children with gender dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body) from enormous distress. That may be beginning to change. Last...
__label__2 Going To Gender JailOPINIONOver the years, you’ve probably heard transgender activists and their allies argue in some form that their bodies are a prison preventing them from becoming their true self. Apparently, more and more governments seem to think that because transgender inmates are already imprisoned by their own flesh and blood, where they’re incarcerated doesn’t matter all too much. A dozen transgender prisoners that have been convicted of sexual or violent crimes are being held in women’s prisons in Scotland, the Timesreported last week. Of the 12 biologically male inmates, only one had undergone surgery and...
__label__5 United States issues its 1st passport with ‘X’ gender markerThe United States has issued its first passport with an “X” gender designation, marking a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who do not identify as male or female, and expects to be able to offer the option more broadly next year, the State Department said Wednesday. The department did not identify the passport recipient, but Dana Zzyym of Fort Collins, Colorado, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview it was their passport.

__label__3 The Culture War Over ‘Pregnant People’ANALYSISLast year, a brand-new labor-and-delivery hospital opened on the well-to-do Upper East Side of New York City. Its name, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns, might strike most people as innocuous or straightforward. But to some people, the suggestion that a hospital where babies are born is for women is offensive, because transgender and nonbinary people who do not identify as women can also get pregnant and deliver babies. Only niche groups tend to care about how Americans discuss gender and pregnancy—including whether it’s better to use the...

__label__5 I’m a Trans Runner Struggling to Compete FairlyOPINIONIn the highly politicized debate over whether transgender women should be allowed to play women’s sports, opinions tend to divide into two starkly opposing camps. There are those people — including lawmakers in dozens of states — who argue that the integrity of girls’ and women’s sports needs to be safeguarded against people assigned male at birth and the physical advantages they may possess. The other side argues that by the very fact of their gender transition, trans girls and women have earned the right to compete as their chosen...

__label__1 Texas Governor Orders Review of Whether Gender-Transition Surgery Constitutes Child AbuseTexas governor Greg Abbott on Friday directed the state Department of Family Protective Services to issue a determination on whether gender-transition surgery on children constitutes child abuse. “Subjecting a child to genital mutilation through reassignment surgery creates a ‘genuine threat of substantial harm from physical injury to the child,’” Abbott wrote in a letter to the department. “This broad definition of ‘abuse’ should cover a surgical procedure that will sterilize the child, such as orchiectomy or hysterectomy, or remove otherwise healthy body parts, such as penectomy or mastectomy. Indeed, Texas already outlaws female genital...
__label__5 Rising shares of U.S. adults know someone who is transgender or goes by gender-neutral pronounsANALYSISIn recent years, several prominent Americans have come out as transgender or gender nonbinary (that is, identifying as neither exclusively a man nor a woman). Governments at both the federal and state levels also have moved toward putting more legal protections in place for transgender people and formally recognizing nonbinary identities. At the same time, a record number of state-level bills have sought to limit definitions of gender to the sex people are assigned at birth. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that growing shares of U.S. adults say they know someone who is transgender or who goes by a gender-neutral...

__label__2 Education Department says Title IX protections apply to LGBTQ studentsThe Education Department on Wednesday issued guidance that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, a reversal of the Trump administration's stance that gay and transgender students are not protected by the law.

__label__2 Why California Just Added Five More States to Its Travel BanCalifornia added five Republican states to its travel ban, the state attorney general announced Monday, meaning state-funded travel is no longer allowed under most circumstances. The ban is in protest of what the attorney general claims are laws that discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Florida, Montana, Arkansas and West Virginia have sought to protect women by preventing transgender women and girls from playing in school sports according to their gender identity. In North Dakota’s case, the state passed a free speech law that critics say will restrict LGBTQ...

Over the last 50 years, Pride has turned from a solemn response to police brutality and discrimination against the LGBTQ community into a celebration of what it means to be queer. Rights for the LGBTQ community in the United States have come a long way — but that isn't the case everywhere in the world. People's rights are still quashed by anti-LGBTQ governments, and in countries like Iran, Myanmar, and Uganda, being...

__label__2 VA Teacher Placed On Administrative Leave After Refusing To Affirm Trans Identity For Kids, Citing FaithAn elementary school teacher in Virginia was placed on administrative leave this week after refusing to affirm transgender identities in children, claiming such behavior is against his faith and “defiles the holy image of God.” Byron “Tanner” Cross, who teaches physical education at Leesburg Elementary School, explained to the Loudoun County school board Tuesday that he will not “affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa” because he loves children who struggle with gender dysphoria and refuses to lie to them, according to Fox News.

Why it matters: It's one of the most egregious journalistic errors in modern history, and the media's response to its own mistakes has so far been tepid. Outsized coverage of the unvetted document drove a media frenzy at the start of Donald Trump's presidency that helped drive a narrative of collusion between former President Trump and Russia.  It also helped drive an even bigger wedge between former...

Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count.

__label__5 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling.

Conservative media has come to his defense, some have almost deified him, while he has been vilified by left-wing legacy media with coverage that has been beyond disingenuous. That being said, right-wing media has omitted key details in its coverage of Rittenhouse, who is on trial for shooting three people, killing two of them, during riots last summer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

Protests against the election process, like Ali Alexander’s “Stop the Steal," were mobilized nationwide in the weeks before Election Day. And in the final presidential debate, Trump went as far as to baselessly claim,“This is going to be a fraud like you have never seen.”  The efforts have continued since the election.

So well known, in fact, that even those outside the business are familiar with it. But what does it actually mean? The common belief among many is that when a source tells a reporter something “off the record” that means the reporter cannot or should not publicly share that information. But that’s not exactly how it works. Just because a source says something is “off the record” does not mean it truly is “off the record.” Here’s how it should work. A...

You’re right to be. But instead of fixing the problem, President Joe Biden and his team are blaming you for it — and telling Americans to just suck it up. It’s outrageous. And short-sighted. The images of hundreds of cargo ships waiting to be unloaded isn’t one of those economic issues ordinary people have a hard time understanding. The inability of the transportation system to handle the flow of goods shipped from manufacturers is threatening to not only make it harder to get...
__label__4 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__3 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...
__label__1 Why Are the Media Treating 'Let's Go Brandon' Like Criminal Hate Speech?ANALYSISLast month, NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his victory in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Sparks 300 race when fans started chanting "fuck Joe Biden." But that's not what Stavast heard. And so the "let's go Brandon" chant—a less vulgar way of signaling one's opposition to the current president—was born. Fans say it at sports gatherings. Conservatives tweet it at each other. Even Republican politicians are getting in on it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) has been known to say it. So what? Well, even though it...
__label__5 The National Trust for Local News is trying to build a $300 million fund to help save local newsIn the crowded field of nonprofits supporting local news ventures, Elizabeth Hansen Shapiro’s National Trust for Local News stands out as something distinct. Rather than grants, the trust makes investments. Advice and some control come with the help. But the point is for recipients to gather other investors and develop models for serving small-town news deserts that are losing all local coverage. I refer to the project as Hansen Shapiro’s because she developed the idea, first as a Ph.D. thesis, then as a research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, and now as a...
__label__3 Barstool Sports is a cesspool of misogyny and bigotryOPINIONBarstool Sports founder and frequent Fox News guest Dave Portnoy said he was in talks with a “major sport” to air games, later confirmed to be Major League Baseball.  The platform, described as a “satirical sports and men’s lifestyle blog” is, in reality, a cesspool of bigotry basking in the backlash against political correctness. Under the pretense of sharing funny videos and embracing a boys-will-be-boys mentality, Barstool has successfully normalized a culture of harassment, misogyny, and rampant misinformation, all while taking cavalier attitudes toward the chaos that ensues. Major League Baseball has recently demonstrated support for Black Lives Matter and is already...
__label__2 For Whom Do the Covid “Fact Checkers” Really Work?OPINIONThere are two types of COVID19 survivors— those who have documented recovery from sars-cov-2 (either PCR, antigen or serology + tests) or those who have self-identified recovery from sars-cov 2 (said they had it). When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...
__label__4 Conservative trust in media has crateredThe percentage of Republicans who say they trust national news organizations has been cut in half over the past five years, according to a new study from Pew Research Center. Why it matters: The party's trust in media starting dropping when President Trump took office, but has plummeted much more dramatically in the Biden era. Details: Prior to the Trump administration, both parties had a great deal of trust in the national media, according to Pew. But while Democrats' trust in the national, local and social media continues to hold steady, Republicans' trust...
__label__3 Biden’s misleading announcement that the United States is no longer at warANALYSISDuring a speech at the United Nations on Sept. 21, President Joe Biden referenced the end of the Afghanistan War, claiming that the United States had finally returned to a peace footing after 20-years of armed conflict.  "​​I stand here today, for the first time in 20 years, with the United States not at war," he said. "We’ve turned the page." The reality is more complicated than that. The withdrawal of the last U.S. troops from Afghanistan on Aug. 30 brought an end to the longest war in American history....
__label__1 Trump Blasts 'Fake News' Report He Threatened to Leave GOPFormer President Donald Trump on Monday slammed a report that he told Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that he planned to leave the GOP and start a new political party. ABC reporter Jonathan Karl, in his new book, "Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show," alleges Trump expressed such plans to McDaniel on his final day as president. "It's a totally made up and fabricated story, it's Fake News. Jonathan Karl is a third-rate reporter working for ABC Non-News," Trump said in a statement tweeted by spokeswoman Liz Harrington. "ABC Non-News and 3rd rate...
__label__5 Partisan divides in media trust widen, driven by a decline among RepublicansIn just five years, the percentage of Republicans with at least some trust in national news organizations has been cut in half – dropping from 70% in 2016 to 35% this year. This decline is fueling the continued widening of the partisan gap in trust of the media. Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (78%) say they have “a lot” or “some” trust in the information that comes from national news organizations – 43 percentage points higher than Republicans and Republican leaners (35%) – according to a new Pew Research Center...
__label__3 America left the Taliban in Afghanistan with a valuable weapon: dataOPINIONOn Sept. 10, 2001, David Tyson — the only CIA officer fluent in Uzbek, the language spoken by more than 1 million Afghans at the time — was desperately trying to prevent a cache of United States-made Stinger missiles from falling into the hands of terrorists. But Toby Harnden's new book, “First Casualty: The Untold Story of the CIA Mission To Avenge 9/11,” detailed how, according to the CIA’s tally, the Taliban already had several dozen missiles; 600 of roughly 2,500 remained unaccounted for. Warfare had changed since the U.S. had secretly...
__label__2 ‘100 Percent False’: Dave Portnoy Denies Sexual Misconduct Allegations, Admits He’s ‘Scared’ Of Cancel CultureBarstool Sports president Dave Portnoy responded on Thursday to an Insider report about allegations of sexual misconduct made against him. The Insider report details an alleged time between Portnoy and a 20-year-old woman who said she felt like she was treated as a “human sex doll,” and that their sex was so allegedly “rough” it felt like she “was being raped.” According to the report, at one point she was allegedly “screaming in pain.” However, Portnoy denied the allegations in the report, saying they were “100 percent false” and that the hookup was “100 percent...
__label__5 Donors’ dilemma: How to help hungry Afghans ... not the TalibanANALYSISThere is no shortage of urgent warnings, led by the United Nations, about the looming threats this winter to the Afghan people: food insecurity for more than half the population, millions of children under 5 at risk of acute malnutrition. “A countdown to catastrophe,” in the words of David Beasley, head of the U.N. World Food Program. Yet politicians are finding it unpalatable to resume massive Western aid to a country ruled again by the Taliban, which have been on official U.S. and European terrorist lists for years. So far,...
__label__3 At least four killed in Taliban crackdown on protests, says UNThe Taliban’s violent crackdown on protests against their hardline rule has already led to four documented deaths, according to a UN human rights official who said the group had used live ammunition, whips and batons to break up demonstrations. Ravina Shamdasani, the UN’s rights spokesperson, told a briefing in Geneva that it had also received reports of house-to-house searches for those who participated in the protests. The protests against the Taliban’s return to power, many of which have been led by women fearful of their status under the Islamist group,...
__label__2 CNN's Van Jones, David Axelrod rip fellow Democrats as 'annoying and offensive,' 'out of touch,' 'moralizing' amid big election night lossAmid the shocking political turnaround in Virginia that culminated with Republican Glenn Youngkin's defeat of far-left Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor Tuesday night, CNN's Van Jones and David Axelrod reflected on how their own Democratic Party managed to lose so big in a blue state. 'Annoying and offensive' Jones surmised that Democrats have been living in a political bubble and not paying attention to voters' real day-to-day needs — and paid for it at the ballot box. "I think that the Democrats are coming across in ways that we don't recognize that...
__label__5 Iran nuclear deal: Talks to resume within weeksTalks aimed at reviving the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six other nations are to resume this month. Iran's chief negotiator Ali Baqeri Kani said that his government had agreed to meet in Vienna on 29 November. The discussions have been on hold since the election of Iran's new hard-line president in June. The US pulled out of the deal under President Donald Trump, but Washington has since said it could consider rejoining. The Biden administration said it will attend the Vienna meet, along with the remaining signatories,...
__label__3 GOP douses Afghanistan withdrawal with misinformationANALYSISThe Afghanistan withdrawal has gone poorly enough for the Biden administration, and it did itself no favors with its faulty predictions about how it would be carried out. But even in the midst of the worst stretch of the Biden presidency thus far, the lure of misinformation has proved irresistible to its GOP critics. They’ve trafficked repeatedly in recent days in false, misleading or unproved allegations involving the Taliban hanging someone from an American helicopter, President Biden skipping a ceremony for 13 Americans killed last week, military dogs being left behind, and...
__label__2 NBC News reporter says Biden’s apparent nap is ‘political obstacle,’ reminds viewers he keeps long hoursANALYSISAn NBC News reporter worked to find excuses Monday for President Joe Biden’s apparent cat nap during speeches at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  Biden, who warned military service members this summer that top Pentagon officials consider climate change to be the "greatest threat" to America’s national security in the coming years, sat with his arms crossed, looking like he was drifting in and out of sleep, in a viral video shared by Washington Post reporter Zach Purser Brown. MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell welcomed NBC News senior White House reporter Kelly O’Donnell to her program...
__label__4 Watchdog finds no misconduct in mistaken Afghan airstrikeAn independent Pentagon review has concluded that the U.S. drone strike that killed innocent Kabul civilians and children in the final days of the Afghanistan war was not caused by misconduct or negligence, and it doesn’t recommend any disciplinary action, The Associated Press has learned. The review, done by the Air Force Lt. Gen. Sami Said, found there were breakdowns in communication and in the process of identifying and confirming the target of the bombing, according to a senior defense official familiar with the report. But, Said concluded that the...
__label__3 With last plane out of Kabul, America's 20-year war in Afghanistan is overThe final U.S. troops in Afghanistan flew out of Kabul Monday at 3:29 p.m. EDT, ending a costly 20-year occupation that started after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and leaving a war-torn country now run by the Taliban. The retreat, announced by the Pentagon, came one minute before Aug. 31 Kabul time, keeping the U.S. in the country right up until a deadline set by President Joe Biden's administration. “Now, our 20-year military presence in Afghanistan has ended," Biden said in a statement, calling it the "unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs and of all of our commanders...
__label__1 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__5 U.S. airstrike kills senior al-Qaeda leader in Syria, DOD saysA U.S. airstrike in northwest Syria on Friday killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. Why it matters: Syria serves as a "safe haven" for the extremist group to plan external operations, according to U.S. Army Maj. John Rigsbee. What they're saying: "The removal of this al-Qaeda senior leader will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out global attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians," Rigsbee said in the statement. U.S. Central Command currently has "no indications of civilian casualties." The...
__label__3 I Taught English to Afghan Soldiers. Now I’m Part of the “Digital Dunkirk” Trying to Get Them Out.OPINIONAs the US began its chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan last week, I couldn’t stop thinking about the many Afghans who have aided American forces and are now stuck in the country, potentially with targets on their backs. A family friend of mine, Joan Barker, worked closely with Afghan special forces and interpreters during her time as a military English teacher there; we connected by phone earlier this week.  I’m an English-as-a-second-language teacher who’s taught on military bases overseas, including in Afghanistan from August 2017 to August 2018. Over the past couple...
__label__1 Conspicuously missing in Facebook whistleblower dumps is any hint of worry about left-wing hate and liesOPINIONAs whistleblowers continue to dump documents revealing internal Facebook discussions about controlling content, one thing is striking: The thousands of pages released so far contain zero signs of staff worries about (or even awareness of) left-wing hate speech and misinformation. Perhaps we’re only seeing part of the picture. But Facebook staffers’ incessant drive to censor right-wing stories and sites suggests they really are blind to the often-outrageous speech from outlets on the other side of the spectrum. The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster report this week detailed how the social-media giant’s “employees have consistently pushed to suppress or de-platform...
__label__5 ‘Why did we fight?’ Challenge of governing is wearing down Taliban.The veteran Taliban fighter once strove for martyrdom on the Afghan battlefield of what he considered an Islamic revolution. But the Taliban insurgency’s lightning victory in August has yet to bring a long-promised paradise, says Rahmatullah. Instead, he fears, it’s revealing internal divisions, even resentment. “We struggled and fought in extreme poverty. Now our leaders are ruling and have luxury cars and lots of facilities, but the majority of mujahideen don’t have salaries and their families are worse off,” says the fighter, who uses one name. “Some of the lower...
__label__3 What Trump’s Disgraceful Deal With the Taliban Has WroughtOPINIONBelieving you’re uniquely capable of bending things to your will is practically a requirement for becoming president of the United States. But too often, in pursuit of such influence over foreign policy, presidents overemphasize the importance of personal diplomacy. Relationships among leaders can build trust — or destroy it — but presidents often overrate their ability to steer both allies and adversaries. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had built such a solid relationship that during the Reykjavik summit most of Reagan’s administration worried he would agree to an unverifiable elimination of nuclear...
__label__1 Legacy Media Fuels Corporate Wokeness But Will Always Choose Wokeness Over CorporationsOPINIONThere’s a misconception that legacy media is an arm of the Democratic Party. There’s also a misconception that legacy media is pro-corporate. It’s true that legacy media is almost always pro-Democrat and almost always pro-corporate. But last week’s Netflix dust-up clarified something important. In recent weeks, Matt Taibbi and Katie Herzog have documented the egregiously bad coverage of Netflix’s internal turmoil over “The Closer,” Dave Chappelle’s latest special for the streamer. Journalists cheered the company’s pro-trans troublemakers with coverage that ranged from deeply misleading to outright false. This isn’t downstream of conspiracies in smoke-filled...
__label__5 Jake Sullivan discussed Saudi-Israel normalization with MBSWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised normalization with Israel during his recent meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, three U.S. and Arab sources tell Axios. Why it matters: Saudi Arabia would be the biggest regional player to sign onto the "Abraham Accords" peace agreement with Israel, and such a major breakthrough would likely convince other Arab and Muslim countries to follow suit. Behind the scenes: During the Sept. 27 meeting in Neom, a futuristic planned city on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast, Sullivan raised the issue and bin...
__label__3 Wait, Is the U.S. Allied With the Taliban Against ISIS Now?There’s an odd historical resonance the fact that Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting Vietnam as the scenes of chaos, bloodshed, and desperation play out in Afghanistan this week. For Americans, the evacuation of Kabul resembles, and has frequently been compared to, that of Saigon 46 years ago. Depending on your political persuasion, both are humiliating surrenders, the inevitable results of American hubris, or some combination of the two. But there may be lessons for Afghanistan’s new rulers as well. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party were once seen as such a grave threat to...
__label__2 Washington Post fact-checker calls asking about Biden visiting the border 'a bit of a gotcha question'Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler seemed to dismiss the ongoing inquires of whether or not President Biden has gone to the southern border and if he has any intention of visiting in the future.  Biden raised eyebrows on Thursday at CNN's town hall when he was asked by an attendee why he hadn't been to the southern border as president.  He responded by saying he had "been there before" but admitted "I guess I should go down" before pointing to his busy schedule that has prevented the visit and touting a trip to the border...
__label__5 US offers to pay relatives of Kabul drone attack victimsThe US government has offered financial compensation to the relatives of 10 people mistakenly killed by the American military in a drone strike on the Afghan capital, Kabul, in August. An aid worker and nine members of his family, including seven children, died in the strike. The Pentagon said it was also working to help surviving members of the family relocate to the US. The strike took place days before the US military withdrew from Afghanistan. It came amid a frenzied evacuation effort following the Taliban's sudden return to power...
__label__3 Fact-checking Joe Biden on U.S. credibility as military withdraws from AfghanistanANALYSISUnder fire over the plight of Afghans and Americans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, President Joe Biden has defended the U.S. military’s withdrawal and pushed back against assertions that U.S. credibility is damaged. On Aug. 20, a reporter asked Biden: "What is your message to America’s partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal and made them question America’s credibility on the world stage?" Biden replied: "I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I've spoken...
__label__1 CNN's Brian Stelter hosts segment calling for reporters to cover Republicans differently than DemocratsL.A. Times columnist claimed Republicans don’t care if the government works well. CNN’s Brian Stelter invited Los Angeles Times columnist Jackie Calmes on his weekly media program on Sunday to declare that journalists need to stop covering the country's two political parties equally because the modern Republicans don't "really care if government works well." "I want to dive right into your argument about what both-siderism is and why it’s failing the public,"Stelter said of Calmes, whose column on the subject won praise from liberal journalists. "Is it that we're treating Democrats and Republicans equally...
__label__5 U.S. Aims to Resume Regular Evacuation Flights From AfghanistanThe State Department plans to resume regular evacuation flights from Afghanistan before the end of the year to help U.S. citizens, residents and some visa applicants leave the country, a senior State Department official said. The small number of U.S. citizens and thousands of Afghans left behind after the chaotic evacuation effort in the final weeks of the U.S. presence in Afghanistan could be eligible for seats on the U.S.-sponsored flights. The last U.S. troops departed on Aug. 31, bringing the 20-year conflict to an end. Since then, a small number of flights have...
__label__3 “We are going to make you beg for mercy”: America’s public servants face a wave of threatsOPINIONDemocracy doesn’t work unless citizens make it work. This not only means showing up to vote but also helping operate and administer the key institutions in a democratic society — such as schools, polling places, and local health agencies. Yet over the course of the past year and a half, the Americans who do this critical work — mostly anonymous individuals motivated by a sense of civic duty — have been subject to a wave of violent threats. Consider the following examples: In Vermont, a man menaced a group of election...
__label__1 CNN Fact Checks Biden’s Town Hall But Neglects Claim That Multi-Trillion-Dollar Agenda Will Cost $0President Joe Biden made some false claims at his town hall with moderator Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, prompting the CNN Newsroom to fact check a few of his statements. Responding to concerns about the southern border Biden stated, “I’ve been there before. I know it well.”  Later, he conceded, “I guess I should go down but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole lot of time to get down.”   CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pushed back against this claim, stating that he “could not find any...
__label__5 The Taliban’s Sharia Is the Most Brutal of AllOPINIONLate last month, the Taliban killed four men and hung their dead bodies in public squares in the northwestern Afghan city of Herat. One lifeless corpse dangled off a crane above throngs of commuters who were stunned at the exhibition and grasping the significance of the moment—a return to the past. The group’s newly appointed mayor declared the killed as kidnappers and boasted about the display of the dead as an effective deterrent. He warned: Other criminals would meet the same fate. Due process was an additional casualty of the...
__label__3 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...
__label__2 COVID-19 Hospitalizations Rising In North, Falling In South, And The Media Is SilentANALYSISThe states with falling COVID-19 hospitalizations are mostly in the south, and the states with rising hospitalizations are mostly in the north. All the while, the media is ignoring the change, when they spent all summer blasting Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Greg Abbott (R-TX) for supposedly mishandling the pandemic. National Review’s Jim Geraghty noted the trend on Thursday, while pointing out that just “four states had double-digit percentage increases in the COVID-19 hospitalization rate.” That would be Michigan and New Hampshire, each with a 25% increase in hospitalizations over the past...
__label__5 The family of the 10 Afghans the Pentagon accidentally killed in a drone strike say the US hasn't offered them any compensationThe family of 10 Afghans killed in error by a US drone strike last month said the US hasn't offered them any compensation, CNN reported. Ten people, including seven children, died after a US drone hit a compound near Kabul on August 29. The Pentagon thought it had found an ISIS-K militant preparing a terror attack, but it had actually struck Zemari Ahmadi, an aid worker, and his family. Ahmadi had been observed loading boxes into his car, which the US military believed were full of explosives. Footage obtained by The New York Times showed that...
__label__3 Twitter flags GOP lawmaker's anime video depicting him killing Ocasio-Cortez, attacking Biden as 'hateful conduct'Twitter added a warning label Monday to a tweet from a Republican lawmaker that depicted an animated killing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and an attack on President Joe Biden — saying the post violated the company's rules about "hateful conduct." But the tweet, from Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., will remain accessible for the "public interest," Twitter said in its notice. Gosar shared an altered video Sunday evening in which he and other Republican lawmakers, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, are depicted as heroes from the Japanese...
__label__1 CENSORED: ABC, CBS, NBC Spent an Entire Year Hiding Hunter, Aired Only 18 Minutes On His ScandalsOPINIONIt’s been exactly one year (October 14, 2020) since the New York Post published damning evidence of Hunter Biden’s corrupt dealings with Ukraine and President Joe Biden’s potential knowledge of his son’s activities. It’s also been a year of  ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows largely censoring the myriad number of Hunter Biden scandals that have been revealed since then.  MRC analysts looked at the broadcast evening news programs from October 14, 2020 to October 13, 2021 and found ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News spent a measly 18 minutes, 4 seconds on all of...
__label__5 About 100 Americans are still trying to get out of AfghanistanAbout 100 US citizens and permanent residents are still waiting to leave Afghanistan, an anonymous senior State Department official told reporters on Monday, according to Reuters. "Our highest priority in Afghanistan, of course, remains helping those American citizens who wish to leave the country now to do so," the official said. The war in Afghanistan effectively ended on August 30 as the remaining US troops left the country, making it more difficult to evacuate Americans who want to come back home. But roughly 85 Americans and 79 legal permanent residents have left...
__label__3 Virginia governor election poised to cripple trans rights in AmericaOPINIONOn Tuesday, Virginia residents will go to the polls to elect state legislators and decide who will be the next occupant of the governor’s mansion. The race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor of the state, and Republican Glenn Youngkin has been closer than expected, with a bitter cultural battle taking center stage in the campaign. While much of the attention has gone to the nationalized moral panic over critical race theory, which explores America’s history of slavery and racial inequality and which conservatives have defined as teaching any...
__label__2 Journalists Publicly Embrace One-Sided Political ReportingOPINIONWelcome back to “Forgotten Fact-Checks,” a weekly column produced by National Review’s News Desk. This week, we examine calls for the mainstream media to be more critical of Republicans, analyze the media’s coverage of the death of Colin Powell, and highlight more media misses. Journalists are Telling on Themselves Reporters from several mainstream-media outlets outed themselves as biased conduits of information over the weekend when they excitedly promoted a Los Angeles Times column that argued journalists are “failing the public with ‘both-siderism’ in political coverage.” Columnist Jackie Calmes laments how “journalist pressure” to be balanced...
__label__5 Taliban official: Strict punishment, executions will returnOne of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan said the hard-line movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers. “Everyone criticized us for the punishments in...
__label__3 Southwest Airlines investigates pilot’s use of ‘Let’s go Brandon’ anti-Biden jibeSouthwest Airlines announced an internal investigation after a pilot was reported to have signed off a message to passengers by saying: “Let’s go Brandon.” The apparent non-sequitur is in fact a rightwing meme, based on a NBC sportscaster’s apparent mishearing of a chant of “Fuck Joe Biden” by a crowd at a Nascar circuit in Alabama at the start of October. On a Southwest flight from Houston, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico on Friday morning, an Associated Press reporter heard the pilot end a message over the public address system with the...
__label__1 LOPSIDED: Dems Swamp Republicans (115 to 16) on Evening News Budget StoriesOPINIONIs there any surprise our national debt keeps climbing when the voices calling for fiscal responsibility are almost completely drowned out by the national media? In the network evening news show coverage of stories about the infrastructure bill, increasing the debt ceiling and President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” spending boondoggle Republican voices were almost completely shut out.  MRC analysts looked at 30 stories on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening programs covering the most recent budget debates from September 23 to October 10 and discovered a whopping disparity in soundbites with Democrats overwhelming...
__label__4 Friction among Taliban pragmatists, hard-liners intensifiesFriction between pragmatists and ideologues in the Taliban leadership has intensified since the group formed a hard-line Cabinet last week that is more in line with their harsh rule in the 1990s than their recent promises of inclusiveness, said two Afghans familiar with the power struggle. The wrangling has taken place behind the scenes, but rumors quickly began circulating about a recent violent confrontation between the two camps at the presidential palace, including claims that the leader of the pragmatic faction, Abdul Ghani Baradar, was killed. The rumors reached such...
__label__2 Survivors Of “Unite The Right” Violence Testified About How The Attack Unfolded: "I Thought I Was About To Die"As a photo of blood streaming down her battered face was shown in the courtroom and memories of the worst day of her life came rushing back, Natalie Romero choked up and her voice cracked. Through tears, she described the moments before the image was taken, when a Dodge Challenger driven by a neo-Nazi plowed into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators in 2017, killing one woman and injuring dozens of other people. “I get hit and the next thing I know is just darkness and hearing a long beep and...
__label__1 Katie Couric withheld Justice Ginsburg’s opposition to racial justice protesters taking a kneeKatie Couric intentionally withheld the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dislike for people who take a knee in protest of racial justice during the national anthem, according to reports from Ms. Couric’s new memoir out later this month. The journalist admitted to trying to “protect” Ginsburg by editing out comments she made about the kneeling controversy during a 2016 interview that Ms. Couric, a former host of NBC’s “Today” show, was doing for Yahoo News. In the article, Ginsburg is quoted saying that taking a knee is “dumb...
__label__4 What has 20 years of the ‘war on terror’ accomplished?On Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.” That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years....
__label__2 Here are the QAnon supporters serving in state legislaturesANALYSISMultiple people who have expressed some level of support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, which got its start on far-right message boards, are now serving in state legislatures throughout the United States. The QAnon conspiracy theory revolves around an anonymous account known as “Q,” who claimed to have an inside scoop showing former President Donald Trump had a secret plot that would take down his perceived enemies, the “deep state,” and a cabal of Democratic pedophiles. Some supporters of QAnon have been tied to violent incidents and participated in the January 6 insurrection at the U.S....
__label__2 The New York Times Spreads Misinformation About COVID-19ANALYSISThe purported threat of social media has emerged once again as a top concern of senators, whistleblowers, and members of the press. They are very, very worried about Facebook fanning the flames of hate, compromising U.S. democracy, and spreading COVID misinformation. How many of them are worried about the COVID misinformation being spread by The New York Times? The paper of record had to print a lengthy correction to a big error in a Thursday news article. The story was about other countries' approaches to vaccinating young people, and whether one shot would be better than...
__label__5 Does the U.S. have any real leverage over the Taliban?Since retaking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have tried to assure the rest of the world that their new government will be different from the brutal, oppressive regime that ruled the country in the years before the American invasion. They have vowed to respect women’s rights to some degree, forgive those who had allied with the U.S. military and prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a staging ground for attacks. “We want the world to trust us,” a Taliban spokesperson said. Unsurprisingly, the notion of a kinder, gentler Taliban has been met with deep...
__label__3 ‘Threats of violence’: School boards curb public comments to calm raucous meetingsParents in one Kentucky school district must communicate with their school board via email after a meeting devolved into a shouting match. In northern Virginia, school officials restricted who is eligible to speak at their meetings. A Florida school board is considering shortening public comment to one minute per person. School leaders nationwide are beginning to eye ways to rein in public commentary at local meetings in an effort to quell raucous crowds over hot-button issues like mask mandates and critical race theory. The potential changes could add more strain...
__label__2 NYT Issues Major Correction After Claiming 900,000 Kids Have Been Hospitalized With COVIDThe New York Times (NYT) issued a correction Thursday after overstating the number of kids who have been hospitalized in the U.S. with the coronavirus. The article, originally published Wednesday, discussed COVID-19 cases among children. “Nearly 900,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since the pandemic began, and about 520 have died,” NYT reporter Apoorva Mandavilli initially wrote. An updated correction said the original publication “misstated the number of Covid hospitalizations in U.S. children. It is more than 63,000 from August 2020 to October 2021, not 900,000 since the beginning of the pandemic.”...
__label__5 Taliban say they took Panjshir, last holdout Afghan provinceThe Taliban said on Monday they have taken control of Panjshir province north of Kabul, the last holdout of anti-Taliban forces in the country and the only province the Taliban had not seized during their blitz across Afghanistan last month. Thousands of Taliban fighters overran eight districts of Panjshir overnight, according to witnesses from the area who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement, saying Panjshir was now under control of Taliban fighters. “We tried our best to solve the problem...
__label__3 'They start calling you Hitler': Why Disneyland has some of the most toxic fans on the internetOPINION“This has to stop,” a Disneyland fan said. There had been a stream of troubling comments for the past few days in the “Vintage Disneyland” Facebook group. People were getting offended, and others were starting to speak out. It started innocently, with people sharing memories of the park with the phrase “My Disneyland had …” My Disneyland had the Welch’s Grape Juice stand. My Disneyland let you fly through the Matterhorn on the Skyway.  But the internet being the internet, things took a dark turn, fast. “My Disneyland didn’t let wokeness...
__label__1 Journalists Face Disaster as COVID-19 Deaths DropOPINIONThe COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. is ebbing, but you would never know it from the headlines. Bad news, accurate or not, sells. And in the case of COVID-19, it also supports the journalists’ prejudices. The seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations peaked and started to decline in early September. Nationwide, COVID-19 hospitalization rates have decreased 17 percent over the past two weeks. Only 19 states had any increase, and many were small. The remaining 31 states and the District of Columbia saw hospitalization rates decline. But that hasn’t stopped journalists from...
__label__4 Afghanistan: Fresh fighting in final anti-Taliban strongholdFresh fighting has been reported in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remains out of the hands of the Taliban. One of the resistance leaders in the valley, Amrullah Saleh, dismissed reports that the Taliban had captured it as "baseless". But he admitted conditions are difficult, with the Taliban closing phone, internet and electricity lines. The fighting comes with the Taliban set to finalise a government. Panjshir Valley, north of the capital Kabul, is one of Afghanistan's smallest provinces and the only one not to have fallen...
__label__3 The Democratic Civil War Has a Winner: Donald TrumpOPINIONFirst, the good news. The government did not shut down at midnight. New covid infections in the United States have fallen twenty-five per cent over the past couple of weeks. Vaccine mandates by large companies and government agencies, many of them imposed at President Biden’s behest, seem to be working—without vaccine-refusenik workers quitting en masse, as threatened. As recent weeks go for the Biden Administration, this one was not terrible. Then again, not shutting down the government because you managed to pass and sign a bill pushing the problem off until early December is...
__label__1 Facebook Smeared Me With Its ‘Fact-Checking.’ Now, I’m Suing the Tech Giant.OPINIONI just sued Facebook. I didn’t want to sue. I hate lawsuits. I tried for a year to reach someone at Facebook to fix things, but Facebook wouldn’t. Here’s the problem: Facebook uses “independent fact-checkers” to try to reduce fake news on its site. That’s a noble goal. Unfortunately, at least one Facebook “fact-checker” is a climate-alarmist group that cleverly uses its Facebook connections to stop debate. Facebook is a private company. It has every right to cut me off. But Facebook does not have the right to just lie...
__label__5 Qatar and Turkey become Taliban's lifeline to the outside worldThe Taliban's celebratory gunfire crackled over Kabul as the West pulled out this week. But militancy alone is likely to leave the Taliban on its own - globally isolated, with millions of Afghans facing an even more uncertain future. The world's powers are now scrambling to exert influence amid the return of the country's Islamist rulers. And in the process two nations from the Arab and Muslim world have been emerging as key mediators and facilitators - Qatar and Turkey. Both are capitalising on a recent history of access to...
__label__3 Far-Right Boogaloo Admits Posing as BLM Supporter While Shooting Up Minneapolis Cop StationA member of the far-right Boogaloo Boys had admitted he traveled from Texas to Minneapolis in the wake of George Floyd’s death and posed as a Black Lives Matter supporter while wreaking havoc on the city. Ivan Harrison Hunter, 24, pleaded guilty Thursday to a single count of rioting. He admitted to firing 13 rounds from an AK-47-style rifle into the 3rd Precinct police station as rioters set the building alight in May 2020. He was then filmed yelling “Justice for Floyd!” Hunter wore a distinctive skull mask during the riot...
__label__1 The Age of Progressive MisinformationOPINIONHow does a stupid and ridiculous lie come to be embraced and promulgated by top officials of the United States government? Well, as it turns out, it’s easy. You start with an easily misinterpreted news photo that seemingly confirms progressive opponents’ assumption about immigration enforcement: that the agents policing our southern border are cruel racists. Then you work up a Twitter mob saying that the photo has captured a tableau of hideous abuse. You add open-borders advocacy organizations and civil-rights groups denouncing the supposed misconduct in the harshest possible terms.
__label__4 Before Afghan collapse, Biden pressed Ghani to ‘change perception’In the last call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Afghanistan counterpart before the Taliban seized control of the country, the leaders discussed military aid, political strategy and messaging tactics, but neither Biden nor Ashraf Ghani appeared aware of or prepared for the immediate danger of the entire country falling to insurgents, a transcript reviewed by Reuters shows. The men spoke for roughly 14 minutes on July 23. On August 15, Ghani fled the presidential palace, and the Taliban entered Kabul. Since then, tens of thousands of desperate Afghans have fled...
__label__3 How one anti-mask activist leveraged TikTok and Facebook to spur local school protests across the countryOPINIONA conservative activist was able to leverage TikTok and Facebook in less than five months to spark nationwide school protests against masks and vaccines, prompting some school districts to respond.  After a TikTok video encouraging conservative protests around the country went viral in April, the account owner created Freedom515, an organization that now has a network of 51 private Facebook groups and over 30,000 members. In the months that followed, the user leveraged both platforms to organize numerous right-wing protests for people fed up with “the direction of things,” including...
__label__2 The Antisocial NetworkOPINIONSome years ago, in a typical attempt to make his point in the most cringe-inducing manner possible, Barack Obama defended the American immigration system on the grounds that, as he put it, “Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.” I’m not actually going to suggest that we deport Mike Krieger, the Brazilian immigrant in question who co-founded Instagram with a friend at Stanford University. (Though if, instead of a billionaire who sold a technology company that allows Kim Kardashian to sell...
__label__4 Majority of U.S. public favors Afghanistan troop withdrawal; Biden criticized for his handling of situationWith the U.S. military evacuation of Afghanistan completed – bringing America’s longest war to an end – 54% of U.S. adults say the decision to withdraw troops from the country was the right one, while 42% say it was wrong, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 23-29. The survey, conducted before the U.S. military pullout was completed, also finds that 69% of the public says the United States mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. The public is also broadly critical of the Biden administration’s handling...
__label__3 ‘Fascist and tyrannical’: US vaccine mandates induce rightwing hysteriaWhen Joe Biden announced sweeping federal coronavirus vaccine requirements for 100 million Americans, the White House was braced for objections from Republican opponents. But this being 2021, the rightwing backlash has gone way beyond mere political debate into the realm of incendiary language that, analysts fear, could translate into direct and violent action. In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster vowed to fight “to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian”. Tate Reeves, the governor of Mississippi, tweeted: “The vaccine itself is life-saving, but this unconstitutional move is terrifying.” JD...
__label__2 ‘Fact Checks’ by Non-Experts Are Shutting Down Genuine Scientific InquiryOPINIONWe recently published a new climate change report in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA). The nearly two dozen co-authors of our paper are experts in solar physics and climate science from 14 countries. We were looking at the role of the Sun in climate change. We found that, depending on which scientific datasets you choose, you could explain the global warming since the 19th century as being anything from mostly natural to mostly human-caused. The huge uncertainty over such a key question is a major concern. A few days after...
__label__5 Victorious Taliban says defeat of U.S. is a lesson to the worldThe Taliban has hailed the American withdrawal from Afghanistan as a "lesson for other invaders" after the last U.S. military aircraft left the country, effectively ending two decades of war. The Taliban celebrated at Kabul's airport on Tuesday with congratulatory messages and celebratory gunshots fired in the air, AFP reported. Newsweek previously broke the news that a U.S. Air Force C17 strategic transport aircraft left Afghanistan on Monday at 11:59 p.m. local time, close to President Joe Biden's August 31 deadline to end U.S. military presence in the country. "Congratulations...
__label__3 Biden Bets on Economic-Plan Win as Democrats Struggle to DeliverANALYSISPresident Joe Biden needs Democrats in Congress to give him a political boost by passing his $4 trillion economic agenda, but deepening divisions in the party threaten the chances of that happening any time soon. Lawmakers are attempting to craft one of the most complex tax and spending bills ever contemplated, with virtually no area of the budget or tax code left untouched, during just a handful of work days this month. The tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is set to start working on its portion of Biden’s $3.5...
__label__1 Politico Finally Acknowledges That Major Portions Of Hunter Biden Story Have Been Verified, Something Conservative Outlets Reported Long AgoANALYSISPolitico has finally acknowledged that major aspects of the Hunter Biden story suppressed by social media outlets ahead of the 2020 election were, in fact, true. The admission comes nearly a month after conservative media outlets reported the same thing, yet the Politico acknowledgment will be seen by other left-leaning media outlets as the necessary verification. Calling it “First in Playbook,” Politico plugged Ben Schreckinger’s newly released book, “The Bidens: Inside the First Family’s Fifty-Year Rise to Power,” which included evidence verifying reporting from the New York Post and other right-leaning outlets....
__label__5 Afghanistan: What was left behind by US forces?Pictures have emerged of Taliban fighters with military equipment left behind by US forces at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport. A total of 73 aircraft, nearly 100 vehicles and other equipment were abandoned by US troops as they pulled out ahead of the 31 August deadline. But US Central Command head Gen Kenneth McKenzie said it had all been rendered impossible to use. "Those aircraft will never fly again," he said. The aircraft abandoned in Kabul include: MD-530 helicopters, used for reconnaissance and close attack A-29 light attack planes
__label__2 The browning of America will be Whiter than we realizeOPINIONCutting taxes for the rich helps the poor. There is no such thing as a Republican or a Democratic judge. Climate change is a hoax. Some political myths refuse to die despite all evidence the contrary. Here's another: When White people are no longer a majority, racism will fade and the US "will never be a White country again." This myth was reinforced recently when the US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790. The majority of...
__label__1 The Media Imagine a Scientific Consensus on Student Mask MandatesOPINION“The scientific research is conclusive: Widespread masking in schools significantly limits COVID transmission among students,” tweeted NPR while promoting its story “Yes, Gov. DeSantis, Studies Do Show Masks Curb Covid-19 In Schools.” According to its author, the “still raging” political debate over whether masks should be required in schools ignores the “scientific consensus” — which purportedly holds that K–12 student mask mandates are invaluable. To buttress this claim, the author cites a few studies suggesting that masks have been effective in mitigating spread of the virus while completely ignoring those that indicate the opposite....
__label__5 The lessons of AfghanistanThe end of America’s war in Afghanistan has prompted an enormous amount of finger-pointing and second-guessing among U.S. officials seeking to make sense of how a 20-year campaign to build up a stable Afghan government could be all but erased in a matter of weeks by the Taliban. U.S. involvement in the country — from the initial choice to invade to the swift withdrawal, and everything in between — will surely be debated for a long time. There are also questions about what the end of the war means for the people of...
__label__3 Oklahoma is preparing to defy its parole board and kill Julius JonesJust hours before the scheduled execution of Julius Jones, a 41-year-old Black man convicted of a murder he says he didn’t commit, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt still hasn’t said whether he’ll commute the death sentence, as activists have urged. Jones was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2002 for the murder of Oklahoma businessman Paul Howell. Jones, who has always maintained his innocence, and his supporters have pointed to deep flaws in the trial as reason for Stitt, a Republican, to commute his sentence to life in prison.  Specifically, they point to Jones’ defense...
__label__2 Google Is Teaching Employees That Listening To Ben Shapiro Leads To ‘Genocide’ANALYSISThe tech giant Google is holding “antiracist” training for its employees that claims a direct link exists between listening to Ben Shapiro, editor emeritus of The Daily Wire and host of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” and committing “mass murder.” The training also places former President Donald Trump on a list of ideas and people that lead to “genocide,” along with “apolitical beliefs” and phrases such as “All Lives Matter.” Shapiro, Trump, and the rest all contribute to the “normalization” of racism that eventually inspires mass shooters and leads to the...
__label__5 It's 7 Months Into Biden's First Term, and Nearly 8 Percent of Humvees Ever Made Are Lost in Taliban's AfghanistanANALYSISThe Taliban inherited many American “gifts” amid their Afghanistan victory. We’ve seen the images of Islamic militants holding U.S.-made rifles and posing beside our own Blackhawk helicopters left behind in the wake of a disastrous withdrawal. We’ve also heard the speculation circling about — that with these “gifts,” the Taliban may have just toppled Vietnam as the 26th largest air force in the world. But now, there’s a new stat to boggle our minds: The Taliban is now in possession of the American military equipment that was gifted to Afghan security forces during the...
__label__3 2 Men Convicted of Killing Malcolm X Will Be Exonerated Decades LaterTwo of the men found guilty of the assassination of Malcolm X are expected to have their convictions thrown out on Thursday, the Manhattan district attorney and lawyers for the two men said, rewriting the official history of one of the most notorious murders of the civil rights era. The exoneration of the two men, Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam, represents a remarkable acknowledgment of grave errors made in a case of towering importance: the 1965 murder of one of America’s most influential Black leaders in the fight against...
__label__1 CNNLOL Ignores Bombshell Report About Lab Funding in Interview with Anthony FauciOPINIONCNN, a far-left propaganda outlet that encourages violence against Trump supporters, obtained an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci and — just as everyone would expect from this crooked outlet — didn’t ask about a bombshell report that could very well get him in some perjury trouble with the U.S. Senate. For those wondering why, during a month of huge news — Afghanistan, hurricanes, etc. — this garbage pile of a news outlet still can’t average even a measly million primetime viewers, this is why. Over at CNNLOL, it’s all propaganda all the...
__label__4 Special Ops veterans' secret mission to rescue 500 Afghans in Kabul rivaled a 'Jason Bourne thriller,' commander saysAn all-volunteer group of American Special Operations veterans of the Afghan war carried out a secret nighttime mission, called the "Pineapple Express," to ferry at-risk Afghans and their families to safety, according to ABC News. The media outlet reported that the group worked under cover of night on Wednesday, and in tandem with the United States military and embassy, to transfer hundreds of Afghans into a US military-controlled zone of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport. As many as 500 Afghan special operators, assets, enablers, and their families were handed over to the...
__label__3 California law school, named for a man who funded the killing of Native Americans, moves to change its nameA San Francisco law school named for a man who orchestrated a massacre of Native Americans is moving to change its name. The University of California Hastings College of the Law does not have the power to change the name, which is written in state law. But the board of directors voted unanimously Tuesday to allow the dean to work with the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to introduce legislation required to do so. "We never shied away from that history, or I never did, and I wanted to confront it," said...
__label__2 The Media Fell for a Viral Hoax About Ivermectin Overdoses Straining Rural HospitalsANALYSISKFOR, an Oklahoma news channel, reported last week that rural hospitals throughout the state were in danger of becoming overwhelmed by victims of a very specific poisoning: overdoses of ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug promoted by vaccine skeptics as a possible treatment for COVID-19. The story went viral, and was seized upon by the mainstream media. But its central claim is substantially untrue. The meat of the story is a series of quotes from an Oklahoma doctor, Jason McElyea, who appears to attribute overcrowding at local hospitals to a deluge of ivermectin overdoses....
__label__5 The Real Reason U.S. Allies Are Upset About AfghanistanANALYSISMy last column pushed back at the chorus of doomsayers who insist that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan—including the disorderly manner in which it played out—had done vast and lasting damage to America’s international position. No doubt some of these commentators genuinely believe their dire pronouncements, and the Islamic State-Khorasan attack on the Kabul airport is bound to intensify those feelings. Even so, I still find the hyperbole and over-the-top rhetoric remarkable. This week, I want to dig deeper and consider why so many people—and especially observers in Europe—appear to see this...
__label__3 ‘I Don’t Want to Die for It’: School Board Members Face Rising ThreatsIt was only days after Sami Al-Abdrabbuh was re-elected to the school board in Corvallis, Ore., that the text messages arrived. The first, he said, was a photograph taken at a shooting range. It showed one of his campaign’s lawn signs — “Re-Elect Sami” — riddled with bullet holes. The second was a warning from a friend. This one said that one of their neighbors was looking for Mr. Al-Abdrabbuh. The neighbor was threatening to kill him. Like many school board races this year, the one in May in Corvallis,...
__label__1 USA Today Bungles Fact Check On Biden Checking WatchA USA Today fact check about President Joe Biden checking his watch during a dignified transfer of military remains has been amended from “partly false” to “missing context.” Fact-checker Daniel Funke posted the original check Wednesday after photos were released which appeared to show Biden checking his watch during the solemn ceremony at Dover Air Force Base after 13 American troops were killed in the Kabul airport bombing. Funke labeled the claim that Biden checked his watch “misleading,” arguing that Biden had properly honored the fallen soldiers and only checked his watch after...
__label__5 Bracing for protests over racial justice and “stand your ground”ANALYSISAmerica is bracing for a sequel to the protests ignited after George Floyd's murder, with the focus now less on police and more on the nation's broader criminal justice system and self-defense laws.  Why it matters: Activists and law enforcement officials warn that two ongoing national trials have the ingredients to reignite racial tensions and public protests when verdicts are handed down. Driving the news: In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring another during protests against police last summer. In the other case, three white...

The incident occurred when a male juror made a joke about the shooting while being escorted to his car, Judge Bruce Schroeder said. "I'm going to summarize what I remember, what I was told," Schroeder said. "He was telling a joke ... he told the officer ... he made a reference about telling a joke about 'Why did it take seven shots to shoot...

__label__5 Florida GOP limits vaccine mandates, flouting White HouseFlorida Republicans approved a sweeping bill Wednesday to hobble coronavirus vaccine mandates in businesses, rejecting claims that they were sacrificing public health to hand Gov. Ron DeSantis a win in his fight against White House virus rules. Lawmakers in GOP-controlled statehouse expedited the measure, along with a package of virus bills, after hours of debate in which Republicans maintained they were protecting workers from onerous mandates by the federal government. “If you want to get a vaccine, you can get a vaccine. If you don’t want to get a vaccine,...

The day before, a boy had been grazed by a stray bullet that pierced his bedroom wall while he was sleeping — one of more than 575 people injured by gunfire across Minneapolis this year. Why wasn’t Frey talking about the wounding of another child, demanded Angela Williams, a Black anti-violence activist who clutched a...
__label__2 The Media’s Finest HourOPINIONAmid the Afghanistan debacle, Team Biden is caught flat-footed as, for once, a typically compliant press holds him to account. Poor Ron Klain. It’s not a good sign when a White House chief of staff to a Democratic president wants to retweet favorable news coverage and all he can find is the least credible and most slavishly loyal commentators on the Internet. The Afghanistan fiasco has created that most disorienting and discomfiting experience for a progressive administration — a serious bout of critical media coverage immune to White House spin and determined to...
__label__5 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...

__label__2 GOP Reps Call on Top Biden Admin Officials To Testify on Bungled Afghanistan WithdrawalA coalition of Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress is demanding that senior Biden administration officials appear on Capitol Hill to be questioned about the bungled U.S. exit from Afghanistan, which cost American lives and left hundreds of Americans stranded in the Taliban-controlled country. Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and 22 colleagues wrote on Monday to the State Department, asking that 34 senior officials appear before the committee for transcribed interviews about exactly what happened in the days leading up to the U.S. withdrawal...
__label__5 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...

Multiple sources who have reviewed the video’s contents confirmed that the deputy was Julio Alvarado, a 16-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office. Alvarado has been named in nine federal civil rights lawsuits, all involving the use of excessive force, the most of any deputy currently employed by the Sheriff’s Office....
__label__1 GOP Lawmakers Concerned Biden Removed Sanctions To Appease IranA group of 33 Republican lawmakers launched an investigation on Thursday into the Biden administration’s decision to remove sanctions earlier this month on entities tied to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program. Congressional Republicans suspect the Biden Treasury Department’s decision is part of a package of concessions meant to entice Iran into resuming negotiations aimed at securing a return to the nuclear deal—though senior U.S. officials dispute this claim, saying that the sanctions were removed following an internal legal review. Diplomatic talks with Iran have stalled since the regime inaugurated a new...

__label__2 Nearly 100 Confederate Monuments Were Toppled Last Year. What Happened to Them?ANALYSISIt’s been a long time since I sat in an American history class, but what I remember of my education in Jacksonville, Florida, in the 1980s and ’90s is how much of it was not fact, but myth. I was taught that the Civil War was fought over states’ rights—a concept that seemed plausibly defensible to a kid—and that “our side” had its own heroes and its own stories worth remembering. Several of my relatives who live in north Florida still fly the Confederate flag on their boats and paste...
__label__1 Biden Rejected Blinken and Austin’s Advice on Gradual Afghanistan WithdrawalOPINIONAfter inheriting the Afghanistan quagmire from his predecessor, newly elect President Biden was staunchly committed to withdrawing troops from the country despite dissent from military advisers. Remembering the iron grip they held on former President Obama, Biden refused to be beholden to military leaders in making foreign policy decisions, despite his own lack of military experience. Biden rejected the recommendations of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to delay the U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa reveal in their upcoming book Peril, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. “The...
__label__4 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...

__label__4 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...

It was the second time that hour that Arnold had been assaulted. By the time the deputies arrived, she said...
__label__1 China shares supposed video of Taliban using US military planes as toysChina has mocked the United States’ chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan by sharing footage that supposedly shows Taliban fighters turning abandoned US military planes into toys. Chinese governmental official Lijian Zhao, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, tweeted the video Thursday. “The graveyard of EMPIRES and their WAR MACHINES. Talibans have turned their planes into swings and toys,” Zhao tweeted alongside the video. It wasn’t immediately clear where the footage was taken, or if it was filmed after US troops withdrew from Afghanistan. The video shows what appears to be a group of...

These appear to show the company has been well aware...
__label__3 Minneapolis Inches Closer to Disbanding Its Police DepartmentOPINIONIt’s no secret that the Minneapolis Police Department—like many other police departments across the country—has disproportionately brutalized Black communities. The nation caught a glimpse of this brutality last year in the widely circulated video clip that showed George Floyd gasping for air under the knee of a uniformed white police officer. Police use of excessive force against Black Americans, who represent 20 percent of the city’s general population, has remained a common phenomenon for decades. Between 2015 and 2020, as a New York Times analysis concluded, Minneapolis police officers were seven times more...
__label__2 Biden Should Look to Israeli Airlifts to Bring Americans in Afghanistan HomeANALYSISIn the wake of the death of 13 American service members, President Biden has proudly hailed our exit from Afghanistan as “one of the biggest airlifts in history.” But, by Biden’s own account, while 5,500 Americans were exfiltrated, at least 100-200 Americans are still left behind. So, as great as that last airlift may have been, it looks like the Biden administration needs another one. To get these remaining Americans out, the Biden administration should be inspired by past rescue missions by Israel to save Jews from hostile lands. Assuming that the...
__label__5 Americans are angry about ... everything. Is that bad?Early this year, country music artists Jeffrey Steele and Aaron Lewis spent hours at Mr. Lewis’ house in Nashville, trying to write a song to their fans. It was going poorly.  Mr. Steele and Mr. Lewis are Nashville veterans. They know how to write songs about summertime and sweet rural life that sell, but they didn’t want to follow the formula. Both conservatives, they wanted a song that would make them feel connected to a community of fans with similar views. Writing one had been hard.  So Mr. Steele looked...

The second Black justice on the Supreme Court made a rare public appearance at the university, following a year of social unrest, racial tension and politicization of classroom teachings. During the talk, he compared experiences in his youth to current events. "Every time I walked into a room, I had to look for something in common, and that's the way we grew up," Thomas said to...
__label__2 Fmr. Afghan Minister: It Was Clear For Years The Taliban Would Take OverAfghanistan’s former Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal said he was not surprised the Afghan government fell as quickly as it did. During an interview with the Associated Press, the former Afghan official stressed Afghanistan’s government was not a western democracy, especially while it was under the rule of Ashraf Ghani. He went on to say, “particularly in the past seven years under President Ghani, we also had a semi dictatorship, a monopolization.” Zakhilwal added the Afghan people had little to no allegiance to their government after years of rampant corruption and...

This is not just reflected in larger cities, but in mountain towns, Southern neighborhoods and Midwestern prairies.   “The Latino population has been dispersing across the United States for years — a reflection of where the nation’s...
__label__2 Money Down The Toilet In AfghanistanOPINIONThis sign of American decadence and stupidity in Afghanistan cannot be improved on. The Spectator columnist Cockburn reports on America’s attempt to turn a nation of medieval goat herders and Islamic hillbillies into penis-possessors and vulva-havers suitable for campus life at some of America’s more elite colleges. Excerpts: So, alongside the billions for bombs went hundreds of millions for gender studies in Afghanistan. According to US government reports, $787 million was spent on gender programs in Afghanistan, but that substantially understates the actual total, since gender goals were folded into practically every undertaking...
__label__5 Can there be a winner in the school culture wars?ANALYSISIn a typical back-to-school season, markers and poster board might be on a classroom supply list. This year, they’re also hot items for protesters attending their local school board meetings.  Mask mandates, critical race theory, “you name the issue and people want to speak out,” says Heath Miller, a high school band director in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who considers this the most stressful period of his 20 years teaching. In recent weeks, individuals in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, lit masks on fire outside a school board meeting. Pro-mask protesters in Fort Worth, Texas, staged a mock...
__label__3 Could sweeping changes be coming to immigration laws? Advocates hope budget bill is the answerWASHINGTON – For decades, lawmakers and immigrant advocates have been working to pass immigration reform on Capitol Hill, often looking to pass bipartisan legislation to extend protections and pathways to citizenship for farmworkers and those who are undocumented. Success has been elusive, but advocates and some members of Congress see the $3.5 trillion budget bill that Democrats and President Joe Biden want to pass this fall as one of their best bets of passing sweeping changes to the nation's immigration laws.  Democrats are hoping to include in the bill pathways to...
__label__1 Fact-Checking 9 Major Biden Claims About Retreat From AfghanistanThroughout the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, which began in mid-August and wrapped up just before midnight Tuesday in that nation’s capital, President Joe Biden made many comments that later proved to be inaccurate.  After 20 years in Afghanistan, the last U.S. military personnel departed, leaving the Taliban to take over completely following Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline. The Taliban is a political and military organization of Islamist extremists that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda terrorist network as they planned the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks...
__label__4 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__3 The browning of America will be Whiter than we realizeOPINIONCutting taxes for the rich helps the poor. There is no such thing as a Republican or a Democratic judge. Climate change is a hoax. Some political myths refuse to die despite all evidence the contrary. Here's another: When White people are no longer a majority, racism will fade and the US "will never be a White country again." This myth was reinforced recently when the US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790. The majority of...

Islamist fighters staged victory parades Wednesday in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-biggest city, as they showed off the US military hardware they’ve now seized. Videos showed heavily-armed Taliban fighters standing on top of a long line of captured Humvees and other tactical vehicles, as they drove along a highway. In embarrassing scenes for the US, a Black Hawk helicopter even...
__label__5 From 9/11's ashes, a new world took shape. It did not last.ANALYSISIn the ghastly rubble of ground zero’s fallen towers 20 years ago, Hour Zero arrived, a chance to start anew. World affairs reordered abruptly on that morning of blue skies, black ash, fire and death. In Iran, chants of “death to America” quickly gave way to candlelight vigils to mourn the American dead. Vladimir Putin weighed in with substantive help as the U.S. prepared to go to war in Russia’s region of influence. Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, a murderous dictator with a poetic streak, spoke of the “human duty” to be...

It shows that the basic wealth levels of families from different racial and ethnic backgrounds have diverged to such a stark degree in the...
__label__2 US Military Allegedly Blocked American Citizens From Entering Kabul Airport, Top GOP Senator Demands To Know WhyThe top Republican member on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations demanded the Biden administration address a report that a U.S. military commander blocked a group of 25 American citizens from entering the Kabul airport. Former Force Recon Marine Chad Robichaux told the Daily Caller News Foundation that his nonprofit organization had organized bus transport to the Kabul airport for 100 Christians, 300 orphans and 25 American citizens early Thursday morning. But when the evacuees arrived at the airport, Robichaux said a “military commander” made a scene and made the evacuees leave...

Driving the news: In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring another during protests against police last summer. In the other case, three white...

__label__4 Fact Checking McAuliffe’s Claim That Youngkin Wants to Ban Books by Black AuthorsFACT CHECKThe Democratic nominee in the Virginia gubernatorial race Terry McAuliffe has accused his Republican opponent Glenn Youngkin of “want[ing] to ban books by prominent Black authors from Virginia schools.” McAuliffe has made similar comments in the past few days, claiming that Youngkin is “closing his campaign on banning books … he wants to ban Toni Morrison’s book Beloved” in an interview with Meet the Press on Sunday. The basis for this claim is Youngkin’s criticism of McAuliffe’s veto of two bills that would have allowed parents to opt their children out of reading texts that contain sexual material. Neither bill...

As he sits there, someone in a canoe comes by and offers to carry him to safety. “No, thanks,” the man replies. “God will save me.” The man paddles off, and the waters continue to rise. Shortly afterward, someone in a boat pulls up to offer help. “No, thank you,” the man says again. “God will deliver me.” The waters rise higher. Finally,...

__label__4 Black adults in the U.S. South more likely than those in other regions to attend a Black congregationDATAWorship habits among Black Christians in the South, where African American churches date back to the 1770s, have long differed from practices of Black Americans in other parts of the United States. Contrasting styles of worship were a source of tension after the Civil War and during mass migrations of Southern Black people to Northern cities, when Black Northerners objected to expressive forms of worship that were common in the South, such as dancing in church. Today, there are few regional differences among Black Americans when it comes to worship styles, but Black Southerners diverge...

Biden, who was marking the 10th anniversary of the monument along with Vice President Kamala Harris, described a "through line" from slavery to the Capitol siege. "You know, there's a tough through line of subjugation of enslaved people from our earliest days to the reigns of radicalized terror of the KKK to Dr. King being assassinated," Biden said. "And through that...

Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...

A lecture by a physicist was canceled at one of America’s premier institutions of science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for reasons having nothing to do with the subject of the lecture. The lecture was canceled not because of its scientific content but because of the politically incorrect views on diversity of the scientist scheduled to give the lecture.

Five years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the FBI paid an informant to pose as a convert to Islam and gather information as part of a counterterrorism investigation in Southern California, according to court records.

He quoted St. Augustine in his inaugural address and regularly cites Pope Francis in speeches. Biden has talked and written about praying the Rosary in the Situation...
__label__3 In major rewrite of church law, Pope Francis aims for clearer penalties for sex abuse offendersThe Vatican said Tuesday that Pope Francis has signed off on a rewrite of the universal Catholic Church's internal penal system, updating a version in place since the 1980s and laying out clearer penalties for the sexual abuse of minors. The changes, years in the making, are in part a response to the church’s raft of abuse and financial scandals — which have often been magnified by secretive, highly subjective decision-making about how and whether to apply punishments.

How would moms and dads manage to not get fired, while watching their kids all day and serving as de facto teachers? In some Democrat-controlled states, politicians did not seem to care. National statistics show that whether a school district was closed for an extended period was correlated less with how severe coronavirus was there, than the political power of unions. Shortly before the pandemic, Virginia state legislators expanded the power...
__label__5 Most Americans Who Go to Religious Services Say They Would Trust Their Clergy’s Advice on COVID-19 VaccinesAs houses of worship continue to reopen, most U.S. adults who regularly attend religious services voice confidence in their clergy to provide guidance on the coronavirus vaccines – and far more say they have heard their pastor, priest, rabbi or imam encourage people to get vaccinated than have heard their clergy raise doubts about COVID-19 vaccines. But a slim majority of regular worshippers say they have not heard their religious leaders say much about vaccinations either way, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Sept. 20-26, 2021.
__label__3 QAnon is spreading amongst evangelicals. These pastors are trying to stop itANALYSISWhen Pastor James Kendall stepped on to the stage of his small church in Madera, California he knew that day's sermon was going to take him in a direction unlike most. He had seen some troubling Facebook posts from members of his congregation. God, he says, was telling him speak out and warn his flock. "I don't like to get off track and off the Bible," Kendall said during a sermon on March 7. "But as a pastor I do have to guard the flock." A false prophet was gaining a foothold...

Today, the Taliban are in control of Afghanistan and providing sanctuary to Al Qaeda. What then did our longest war accomplish? The Afghan army and government we stood up and sustained for decades has collapsed. The U.S. military has withdrawn. U.S. citizens and thousands of Afghans who fought alongside us have been left behind. The triumphant Taliban of...
__label__5 Abortion, religion, gun rights on agenda as Supreme Court starts new termThe Supreme Court begins a new nine-month term on Monday, with major cases on abortion, religion and gun rights on the docket. Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...
__label__3 Alabama Lifts Three-Decade-Old Ban on Yoga in Public Schools. But There’s a Catch.ANALYSISAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill Thursday lifting a nearly three-decade-old ban on teaching yoga in the state’s public school system. The bill, which sailed through the Republican-dominated statehouse, undoes a 1993 Alabama board of education move to prohibit the practice of yoga as well as meditation in the state’s schools, a push that was fueled by what the Montgomery Advertiser described as “moral panic” among the state’s right-wing, conservative set. Now, 28 years later, the state is ready to grow up and move on and will allow local school boards to decide...
__label__2 Larry Elder and Team Targeted by Egg Throwing Attack in Los AngelesMultiple people, including a woman wearing a gorilla mask, threw eggs at Republican California gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Videos of the incident appear to show an egg being thrown toward Elder as he walked through the Venice neighborhood with members of his campaign team during a trip to the community to address the homeless crisis. One of Elder’s staffers puts his arm on the Republican’s back and warns, “We’re getting egged from behind.” Moments later, someone launched a second egg toward the candidate and his team. The...
__label__5 Globally, Social Hostilities Related to Religion Decline in 2019, While Government Restrictions Remain at Highest LevelsSocial hostilities involving religion, including violence and harassment against religious groups by private individuals and groups, declined in 2019, according to Pew Research Center’s 12th annual study of global restrictions on religion, which examines 198 countries and territories. In 2019 – the most recent year for which data is available, covering a period before the disruptions accompanying the coronavirus pandemic – 43 countries (22% of all those included in the study) had “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities. That is down from 53 countries (27%) in 2018, and from...
__label__3 Pelosi’s archbishop says prominent Catholics who support abortion rights should be denied CommunionThe Most Rev. Salvatore J. Cordileone was careful not to name any Catholics in his latest letter calling for Holy Communion to be withheld from public figures who support abortion rights. But the 17-page missive from the archbishop of San Francisco may have important implications for one of the archdiocese’s most famous parishioners: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi, a California Democrat and high-profile Catholic, has long supported women’s right to access abortion care — and, for nearly as long, she has come under fire from those who say her views...
__label__2 CNNLOL Ignores Bombshell Report About Lab Funding in Interview with Anthony FauciOPINIONCNN, a far-left propaganda outlet that encourages violence against Trump supporters, obtained an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci and — just as everyone would expect from this crooked outlet — didn’t ask about a bombshell report that could very well get him in some perjury trouble with the U.S. Senate. For those wondering why, during a month of huge news — Afghanistan, hurricanes, etc. — this garbage pile of a news outlet still can’t average even a measly million primetime viewers, this is why. Over at CNNLOL, it’s all propaganda all the...
__label__5 Pope Francis Makes His First Public Appearance From The Hospital Since His SurgeryFrom the balcony of a tenth-floor window at hospital in Rome, Pope Francis made his first public appearance Sunday since having major intestinal surgery a week ago. The Vatican says the 84-year-old pontiff has been on the mend since his scheduled surgery on July 4 to remove a portion of his colon that had narrowed due to inflammation. This is his first known hospital stay since being elected to the papacy in 2013. During his Sunday address, the pope addressed the need for all people to have accessible health care. Reading from...
__label__3 NYC man arrested on hate crime charges for vandalizing synagogues as antisemitic incidents remain historically highSurveillance footage showing a man hurling rocks through the doors and windows of houses of worship in New York City left community leaders on edge. Over the weekend, police arrested a 29-year-old man on hate crime charges in connection with the vandalization of several Bronx synagogues, which included the destruction of prayer books.  The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force announced Saturday that they arrested Jordan Burnette, who is from the Bronx, for refusing to cooperate with officers and provide proper identification after he was stopped for riding a bicycle...

__label__5 Pastors Often Discussed Election, Pandemic and Racism in Fall of 2020DATAReligious belief is key to many Americans’ political identities, but the public is divided on whether clergy should preach about politics from the pulpit. So, when pastors across the country addressed their flocks last fall, how did they discuss an election that many Americans viewed as historically important?
__label__3 Supreme Court halts California pandemic restrictions on at-home worshipA tightly divided Supreme Court ruled late Friday to prevent California from enforcing restrictions on in-person religious meetings in homes, including prayer groups and Bible studies.The 5-4 ruling with conservatives in the majority was the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions to block state governments from imposing some coronavirus pandemic-related restrictions on religious events. California had limited indoor gatherings to three households or fewer, with different rules for other places.

Fox News identified the teacher as Kristin Pitzen of Newport-Mesa Unified School District in Orange County. In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...
__label__5 Inside the Digital Lives of the Women of the Islamic StateANALYSISLittle is more telling about a group of people than their private communications. And for understanding the remnants of the Islamic State in Syria, there are few better sources than the Telegram chats of female members currently in Syrian detention camps. Cell phones are prohibited there, and the punishment for having one can be severe. Yet, text chains find their way.
__label__3 America's Only LGBTQ Historic District Is Falling ApartANALYSISOne of North America’s first openly lesbian poets launched her career by pissing off H.P. Lovecraft. In 1918, at the age of 19, Elsa Gidlow started publishing North America’s first known LGBTQ-themed magazine out of her home in Montreal. Combining queer poetry, one-act plays about young gay love, and progressive social commentary, Les mouches fantastiques quickly gained a cult following far beyond the city and even Canada—culminating in a back-and-forth literary journal spat with the noted horror writer (and racist), who decried the magazine’s promotion of an “ancient selfish hedonism.” In 1920, Gidlow moved...
__label__2 Psaki charges sexism and racism are part of what's driving criticism of Kamala HarrisWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said she feels that sexism and racism have contributed to the intensity of criticism faced by Vice President Kamala Harris."I do think that it has been easier and harsher from some in the right wing who have gone after her because she is the first woman, the first woman of color. I’m not suggesting anyone will acknowledge that publicly," Psaki said during an appearance on Politico's "Women Rule" podcast Wednesday.
__label__5 Pope Francis hospitalized for planned intestinal surgeryPope Francis was hospitalized in Rome on Sunday afternoon for scheduled surgery on his large intestine, the Vatican said. The news came just three hours after Francis had cheerfully greeted the public in St. Peter’s Square and told them he will go to Hungary and Slovakia in September. The brief statement from the Holy See’s press office didn’t say exactly when the surgery would be performed at Gemelli Polyclinic, a Catholic teaching hospital, only that there would be a medical update when the surgery is complete. But the Vatican indicated...
__label__2 Column: Biden’s in deep trouble. He can still bounce backOPINIONWhen Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he had all the advantages of a nonincumbent in a year when everything had gone wrong. Biden waged a careful, disciplined campaign, built around a simple message: He would end the pandemic, rebuild the economy and restore normalcy. After the chaos of the Trump years, that was enough. Governing has been more difficult. The pandemic, fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, didn’t end. The economy’s recovery has come with worrisome inflation, shortages and supply chain problems. In public opinion polls,...

__label__5 What a court win for religious groups means for LGBTQ rightsThe Supreme Court last week unanimously sided with a Catholic foster care agency in Philadelphia in a closely-watched case that may have significant implications for religious freedom and LGBTQ rights in the United States. The case, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, was brought to the court by Catholic Social Services, a religious foster care agency that had its contract with the city canceled because of its policy of refusing to place children with same-sex couples. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that city officials had violated the...
__label__3 How These Ultrawealthy Politicians Avoided Paying TaxesAs a member of Congress, Jared Polis was one of the loudest Democrats demanding President Donald Trump release his tax returns. At a rally in Denver in 2017, he warned the crowd that Trump “might have something to hide.” That same year, on the floor of the House, he introduced a resolution to force the president to release the records, calling them an “important baseline disclosure.” But during Polis’ successful run for governor of Colorado in 2018, his calls for transparency faded. The dot-com tycoon turned investor broke with recent...
__label__1 The Book Version Of The New York Times’s 1619 Project Doubles Down On Junk HistoryOPINIONThe New York Times has produced a forthcoming book version of its error-riddled 1619 Project, whose outrageous central claim is that slavery and racism are the true basis of the American project — that America wasn’t founded on the proposition that “all men are created equal” but on white supremacy. Indeed, the book’s subtitle is “A New Origin Story,” which is precisely what Nikole Hannah-Jones’ lead essay for the original 1619 Project proposed: America’s founding ideals “were false when they were written,” and our true origin is not 1776 but 1619, the...
__label__5 How Joe Biden is navigating a Catholic Church in conflictCatholic voters, like the rest of the U.S., are increasingly polarized around issues like abortion – creating a challenge for Mr. Biden, the nation’s second Catholic president. Every weekend, almost without fail, President Joe Biden goes to church. If he’s in Washington, he attends Mass at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown. If he’s at home in Wilmington, Delaware, he goes to his family parish, St. Joseph on the Brandywine. In his victory speech last November, President-elect Biden cited the popular Roman Catholic hymn “On Eagle’s Wings,” and in his...
__label__3 Corporations Control Canada’s Infrastructure — But the Major Parties Won’t Confront ThemOPINIONConfident that he will be able to secure a third term in office, Justin Trudeau has called a federal election. His gambit is a bold one and may backfire — the election, scheduled for this Monday, is taking place against a backdrop of a series of long-standing crises. First and foremost is the damage inflicted on Canadian society by the global pandemic, which the country has failed to curb. The climate crisis, made salient by a summer of extreme and deadly weather, also looms large. In June, members of the...
__label__2 Biden calls Satchel Paige 'the great negro' in latest gaffePresident Biden referred to the late baseball player Satchel Paige as "the great negro" before correcting himself during his Veterans Day address at Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday. Biden was honoring former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Donald Blinken, an Army veteran and father of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his speech when he launched into a story about Paige, who played in the so-called "Negro leagues" before moving to Major League Baseball in the late 1940s. "I’ve adopted the attitude of the great negro at the time, pitcher of the Negro leagues,...

__label__5 Between religious and LGBTQ rights, what does fairness look like?ANALYSISCasey Pick has always viewed Kim Colby with a certain amount of wary respect.  Both are accomplished attorneys, and both are advocates for causes that cut to the heart of their deepest selves. They are on opposite sides of what has been one of the nation’s most divisive and intensely personal political debates – about sex, gender, and the civic integrity of religious belief. Ms. Pick fights for policies that support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people, especially transgender youth in crisis. Over the years she’s...

__label__2 McAuliffe calls for Virginia to 'diversify' teacher base, citing percentage of White teachersVirginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe called for the Old Dominion state to "diversify" its teacher base, lamenting that the commonwealth has proportionately more White teachers – and promising a program ostensibly aimed at attracting non-White teachers. "We got to work hard to diversify our teacher base," McAuliffe said at a campaign event in Manassas Sunday.  "Fifty percent of our students are students of color, 80% of the teachers are White, so what I’m going to do for you, we’ll be the first state in America," he continued.

__label__4 Jewish Americans in 2020DATAWhat does it mean to be Jewish in America? A new Pew Research Center survey finds that many Jewish Americans participate, at least occasionally, both in some traditional religious practices – like going to a synagogue or fasting on Yom Kippur – and in some Jewish cultural activities, like making potato latkes, watching Israeli movies or reading Jewish news online. Among young Jewish adults, however, two sharply divergent expressions of Jewishness appear to be gaining ground – one involving religion deeply enmeshed in every aspect of life, and the other...

Despite the potentially deadly threats that King faced as a leader of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott, the county sheriff, Mac Sim Butler, said no. Next week the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York law similar to the Alabama statute that empowered local officials like Butler to decide who could exercise the constitutional right to bear arms. The briefs urging the Court to overturn New York's statute include several...

The images she saw that day remain sharp: The giant American flag carried by the crowd as they marched from the Ellipse. Singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on the Capitol steps. And finally, entering the building through open doors and standing peacefully in its cavernous Rotunda. She’s aware of the videos showing mob violence. But that must have been on the other side of the Capitol, she...
__label__3 Why Ron DeSantis is more dangerous than TrumpOPINIONThere should be a special place in hell — or potentially in prison — for politicians who put their political goals ahead of the health and safety of our children. That is exactly what Gov. Ron DeSantis is doing in Florida with the executive order he signed last Friday barring school districts from mandating that students and school employees wear masks during the spike in Covid cases. Beyond his potentially deadly decision about Florida schools, DeSantis poses a different, but familiar, danger to our country. As Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said Wednesday on...
__label__1 Black voters in two of America’s most liberal cities sour on calls to ‘defund the police’Marques Warren got a late-night phone call at his Seattle home last year during racial justice riots, and it turned him against the idea of “defund the police.”  The call came from the security alarm company for the liquor store he owns downtown. A break-in was in progress. Amid the mayhem of protests over the killing of George Floyd, sensors on the plate-glass windows detected the repeated blows of people trying to smash their way inside the store. Mr. Warren quickly answered “yes” when the security company asked whether he wanted them to call the police.  A few minutes later, the company called...

__label__2 A Quick Reminder That Mandating Vaccines Is Totally ConstitutionalOPINIONAnti-vaxxers and anti-mask people are loud and wrong all the time. It’s a devastating combination. They’ve got an entire white-wing media echo-sphere that amplifies their wrong ideas. They have social media algorithms that elevate their ignorance and misinformation, such that even calling them out boosts their uninformed or willfully false takes. Moreover, the sheer breadth of things they are wrong about is dizzying. The vaccine has been blamed for everything from causing new Covid-19 variants (it doesn’t) to granting people the power to control metal, like Magneto (I wish). The...
__label__2 Inflating Grades For Social JusticeOPINIONAt a party over the weekend I was introduced to a college professor, and fell into conversation with him about teaching and Covid. Then I asked about how wokeness affects his teaching. I had no idea of the man’s politics, but I would bet the farm that he is a liberal, given that his academic field skews heavily to the left. He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...
__label__4 What the decline in religious affiliation means for AmericaJust 47 percent of Americans say they are members of a church, synagogue, mosque or other house of worship, according to a new survey released by Gallup late last month. It’s the first time churchgoers have dropped beneath 50 percent since Gallup began recording data on the subject more than 80 years ago. The new finding continues a sharp decline in religious affiliation that started at the turn of the century. In 1937, the first year Gallup asked about membership, 73 percent of respondents said they attended a house of...

Loyal allies began turning on him. Top Republicans vowed to make a full break from his divisive tactics and dishonesties. Some even discussed removing him from office. By spring, however, after nearly 200 congressional Republicans had voted to clear Mr. Trump during a second impeachment proceeding, the conservative fringes of the party had already begun to rewrite history, describing the Capitol riot as a peaceful...
__label__1 MIT Canceled a Professor's Guest Lecture Because He Opposes Race-Based AdmissionsANALYSISDorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...
__label__4 Kansas Legislature edits video of public hearing to omit profane rant targeting a journalistThe Kansas State Legislature has altered video footage of a recent hearing to omit a profane rant targeting a journalist, raising questions about the editing of public records. On Saturday, at a hearing held by the state’s Special Committee on Government Overreach and the Impact of COVID-19, Justin Spiehs testified before the committee to criticize mask and vaccine requirements. At the end of his testimony, he launched into a tirade against Kansas Reflector editor-in-chief Sherman Smith, telling him to “go f— yourself, you little b—-” and calling him a “snarky motherf—-er.” Smith, who was...

The retail giant confirmed to City Journal that it has been working with the Racial Equity Institute, a North Carolina company devoted to “creating racially equitable organizations.” Walmart said it has “engaged REI for a number of training sessions since 2018” and has “found these sessions to be thought-provoking and constructive.” City Journal’s Christopher...

In Chelsea, people showed it to attend a John Mulaney stand-up set at City Winery. And in Troy, N.Y., patrons are using it to enter an intimate, speakeasy-style bar that only admits vaccinated guests. This magic ticket is New York State’s Excelsior Pass, which was introduced in March as the first and only government-issued vaccine passport in the country, accessible, for now, only to people who...
__label__2 Football And America’s ReligionOPINIONLast night the Las Vegas Raiders forced out legendary football coach Jon Gruden after a slew of his private emails containing “homophobic” and “misogynistic” language were leaked. The story is the same as thousands that precede it. Gruden is just another scalp on the woke culture warriors’ walls. The New York Times is proud of their reporting that brought down the Super Bowl-winning coach. There’s nothing new to these cancellation tactics, and we’ll see the cackling hyenas in the left-wing press pursue more scalps in the near future. This story does, however, reveal the warped moral...
__label__4 Americans Revert to Favoring Reduced Government RoleDATAWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans have shifted back to favoring a more hands-off approach for government in addressing the nation's problems after a rare endorsement of a more active role last year. Currently, 52% say the government is doing too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses, while 43% want the government to do more to solve the country's problems. In contrast, a record-high 54% of U.S. adults last year said the government should do more to solve problems. Gallup's question on the proper government role is asked as...
__label__3 Feds are tracking Americans' social media to identify dangerous conspiracies. Critics worry for civil liberties.Since 2018, at least three white supremacist mass shooters in America have referred to the “Great Replacement” theory, a conspiracy claim that white people are being replaced in the U.S. and elsewhere by immigrants of color.  That’s the narrative Robert Bowers alluded to on social media before killing 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. Patrick Crusius, who killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, less than a year later, was inspired by the racist trope. So was John Earnest, who killed one person...
__label__2 A Different Approach to Anti-RacismANALYSISChloé Valdary had an unusual childhood. She grew up in a Christian family, but one that celebrated Jewish holy days. She was raised in New Orleans, a city dominated by Catholicism and its symbols, but her church was anti-Catholic. She's black, but her first steps into identity politics and activism were in opposition to antisemitism. And even with her religious upbringing, it was something an agnostic professor said that provoked her eureka moment. So it's perhaps unsurprising that her approach to anti-racism is different from that of best-selling leftist consultants...

__label__4 Globally, Social Hostilities Related to Religion Decline in 2019, While Government Restrictions Remain at Highest LevelsSocial hostilities involving religion, including violence and harassment against religious groups by private individuals and groups, declined in 2019, according to Pew Research Center’s 12th annual study of global restrictions on religion, which examines 198 countries and territories. In 2019 – the most recent year for which data is available, covering a period before the disruptions accompanying the coronavirus pandemic – 43 countries (22% of all those included in the study) had “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities. That is down from 53 countries (27%) in 2018, and from...
__label__3 Sinema’s Tax-Rate Blockade Prods Democrats Left Toward Billionaires’ TaxSenator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona and one of her party’s only holdouts on President Biden’s sprawling budget bill, has cultivated a profile in Congress as a business-minded centrist. But her refusal to raise tax rates on high earners and major corporations to pay for Mr. Biden’s plan is pushing Democrats toward wealth taxation and other measures once embraced only by the party’s left flank. The frenzied search for new paths around Ms. Sinema’s tax-rate blockade has cheered liberals but raised serious qualms among more moderate Democrats, who now openly say they hope that...
__label__2 Washington state school required White privilege training for teachersA Washington state public high school required its teachers in 2018 to undergo mandatory training in White, heterosexual male privilege. The suburban Tumwater School District, southwest of Tacoma, hired a consultant to help the predominantly White high school faculty “examine our privilege” and learn about microaggressions at a two-hour, in-service session, according to a teacher who anonymously sent materials to the conservative advocacy group Parents Defending Education (PDE) on Aug. 4. “Because everyone was terrified to contribute to the discussion we were supposed to be having, lest we offend someone...
__label__5 Free speech in a pandemic: Congress wrestles with drawing a lineWhen Twitter recently banned a former New York Times journalist dubbed “the pandemic’s wrongest man,” many of his critics cheered. But others, including some who oppose his views, raised concerns about a world in which private corporations – taking their cues from mainstream media and government officials – can silence dissenters in today’s digital public square. Over the past year and a half, Alex Berenson grew his Twitter base to some 344,000 followers by pillorying public health officials’ approach to the pandemic. Like many Twitter pundits, he was irreverent and provocative....
__label__3 Will Banks Have To Report All Transactions Over $600 to IRS Under Biden Plan?ANALYSISClaim: The Biden Administration’s American Families Plan proposes that financial institutions report all transactions from personal and business accounts except those below $600. Rating: Mixture What's True: According to the proposed American Families Plan, banks would “report gross inflows and outflows” for all business and personal accounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), “with the exception of accounts below a 'low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600.'” But ... ... this does not mean all individual transactions above that threshold would be reported....

Be human first, vote for humanity.” McGowan said she is not a Democrat anymore but added that she and Elder do have their political differences. The actress also said Elder is “the better candidate”...
__label__5 Australia Traded Away Too Much LibertyOPINIONIn a bid to keep the coronavirus out of the country, Australia’s federal and state governments imposed draconian restrictions on its citizens. Prime Minister Scott Morrison knows that the burden is too heavy. “This is not a sustainable way to live in this country,” he recently declared. One prominent civil libertarian summed up the rules by lamenting, “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes.” Up to now one of Earth’s freest societies, Australia has become a hermit continent. How long can a country maintain emergency restrictions on its citizens’ lives...
__label__3 The facts around an IRS proposal some claim would allow 'spying' on Americans' bank accountsANALYSISRecently, the Internal Revenue Service has gotten a lot of attention on social media -- specifically, an obscure proposal by the Biden administration to widen the authority to root out tax evasion by allowing the IRS to get annual, aggregated reports of flows from bank accounts with a minimum of $600. But it's not Biden officials or Democrats who are pushing the topic most aggressively on Twitter and other platforms. It's Republicans and right-wing media outlets attacking the proposal as a violation of privacy and arguing that the IRS would...
__label__2 Google Is Teaching Employees That Listening To Ben Shapiro Leads To ‘Genocide’ANALYSISThe tech giant Google is holding “antiracist” training for its employees that claims a direct link exists between listening to Ben Shapiro, editor emeritus of The Daily Wire and host of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” and committing “mass murder.” The training also places former President Donald Trump on a list of ideas and people that lead to “genocide,” along with “apolitical beliefs” and phrases such as “All Lives Matter.” Shapiro, Trump, and the rest all contribute to the “normalization” of racism that eventually inspires mass shooters and leads to the...
__label__5 More Americans now say government should take steps to restrict false information online than in 2018DATAAmid rising concerns over misinformation online – including surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, especially vaccines – Americans are now a bit more open to the idea of the U.S. government taking steps to restrict false information online. And a majority of the public continues to favor technology companies taking such action, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Roughly half of U.S. adults (48%) now say the government should take steps to restrict false information, even if it means losing some freedom to access and publish content, according to the survey...
__label__3 Democrats likely to throw billions in tax hikes overboard as spending plans shrinkDemocrats will likely drop hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed tax increases on the rich as they scramble to shrink the size of their “reconciliation” package. That’s good news for moderates who are less enthusiastic about raising rates. But it’s potentially terrible news for progressives hoping to stick it to the rich. Many see this as their best chance in years to push through major changes in how wealthy people are taxed — such as a proposal to begin taxing, for the first time, billionaires’ unrealized capital gains. The...
__label__2 Marxism Underpins Black Lives Matter AgendaOPINIONYou may not hear as much now about Black Lives Matter as you did in the fateful year of 2020, but rest assured, it is still deeply affecting key aspects of our lives today. The divisive critical race theory conflicts flaring across the country are a legacy of BLM. So is the crime wave that blights our cities, as are the race-conscious policies that President Joe Biden is signing into law. Not bad for organizations founded by Marxists who set out explicitly to dismantle the foundations of American society. As...
__label__4 Biden Administration Moves to Tilt Pay and Power Toward WorkersPresident Biden is advancing a series of regulatory changes aimed at increasing workers’ pay and gaining them other benefits, moves that opponents say could burden businesses amid an uneven economic recovery. The rule changes, most of which are still in progress, would affect workers such as federal contractors, tipped employees and workers who are jointly employed, such as those with jobs at franchised brands. In some cases, the changes seek to reverse Trump administration efforts. In others, the Labor Department is working to implement its own rules. What policies would...
__label__2 A Mileage Tax? No, Biden’s Bill Doesn’t Impose New Driving TaxANALYSISClaim: President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill/plan will establish a driving mileage tax. Rating: Mostly False Context: U.S. President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan does not impose a new mileage tax on drivers. However, as tax revenue from gasoline purchases continues to fall, the plan does call for the establishment of a voluntary pilot program to study the potential impacts of a driving tax. A persistent rumor in the summer of 2021 was that somewhere buried in United States President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan was a...
__label__2 Civil rights groups challenge new Texas voting legislationCivil rights groups on Friday filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to block Texas’ new voting legislation, saying it would violate the civil rights of minorities by making it more difficult for them to cast their ballots. “The Texas Legislature’s claims of voter fraud and voter integrity are merely pretexts for their actual purpose in enacting SB1, which is to make it harder for citizens of color and citizens with disabilities to cast their votes,” said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of...
__label__4 We Disagree on a Lot of Things. Except the Danger of Anti-Critical Race Theory Laws.OPINIONWhat is the purpose of a liberal education? This is the question at the heart of a bitter debate that has been roiling the nation for months. Schools, particularly at the kindergarten-to-12th-grade level, are responsible for helping turn students into well-informed and discerning citizens. At their best, our nation’s schools equip young minds to grapple with complexity and navigate our differences. At their worst, they resemble indoctrination factories. In recent weeks, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Iowa, Idaho and Texas have passed legislation that places significant restrictions on what can be taught in...
__label__3 More Than Half of America’s 100 Richest People Exploit Special Trusts to Avoid Estate TaxesIt’s well known, at least among tax lawyers and accountants for the ultrawealthy: The estate tax can be easily avoided by exploiting a loophole unwittingly created by Congress three decades ago. By using special trusts, a rarefied group of Americans has taken advantage of this loophole, reducing government revenues and fueling inequality. There is no way for the public to know who uses these special trusts aside from when they’ve been disclosed in lawsuits or securities filings. There’s also been no way to quantify just how much in estate tax...
__label__2 Taxonomy Of Woke ReligionOPINIONHere’s a Shellenberger essay explaining why wokeism is a religion. He begins by pointing out how the devoutly woke believe things that are demonstrably untrue, but that are defended fanatically by the true believers. More: But just because an ideology is dogmatic and self-righteous does not necessarily make it a religion, and so it is fair to ask whether Wokeism is anything more than a new belief system. There is no obviously mythological or supernatural element to Woke ideology, and its adherents rarely, if ever, justify their statements with reference to...

Will the crisis prompt reforms in children’s welfare that family advocates say are long overdue? Charlee Roos loved the “buddyship days” she shared with her father when she was a kid. He would take her out for Mickey Mouse pancakes, attend all her soccer games, and go to her dance recitals, “even though he didn’t really get dance competitions.” He was her best friend, Ms. Roos says.  Two days before Christmas, Kyle Roos died...
__label__3 Judge rules Democrats can have only limited access to Trump's financial recordsA federal judge in Washington gave a partial victory Wednesday to a House committee in its long-running effort to get financial records from Donald Trump's accounting firm. But the ruling also gave some ground to the former president by limiting the nature and scope of the records sought. U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta said the House Oversight and Reform Committee can proceed with a subpoena to get documents from Mazars, the accounting firm, to examine the nature of Trump's federal lease for a hotel in Washington. The committee can also get financial records to look...
__label__2 How Getting Fired For His Beliefs Became A Huge Opportunity For My Husband And Our Family CancelingOPINIONCanceling conservatives is not silencing or cowing them. It is driving Christians to consider the connections between their faith and their money and jobs. “You may be a CEO who is a Christian, but not a Christian CEO.” These are the words that I believe eventually led to my husband’s departure from his company. He had run a successful tech company for more than a decade, and 2020 was the most profitable year yet. However, identity politics led the company to value cultural compliance over performance. Like many other Christians,...
__label__5 California has the most gun-control laws in US. Do they work?ANALYSISCalifornia is by far the most regulated state in America when it comes to restricting the sale, use, and ownership of guns. Gun-control advocates call it the national leader, the “tip of the spear” setting the tone for other states, as Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at Brady, a gun-control advocacy group, puts it. The Golden State also has had a series of high-profile public mass shootings in recent years – in San Bernardino, Thousand Oaks, and this week, San Jose. On May 26, a gunman opened fire on...
__label__2 CEO pay at big companies rose nearly 19% last year to $24 million, report findsThe chief executives at major U.S. corporations received millions of dollars in bonuses or raises last year even as many companies saw slumping sales and job cuts because of the pandemic, a new analysis shows. CEO compensation at the top 350 companies jumped nearly 19% in 2020 to an average $24.2 million, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank. By comparison, pay for rank-and-file workers last year rose roughly 4%. The typical corporate leader at big companies in 2020 made $351 for every dollar earned by a typical employee,...
__label__2 Biden’s Visit to the VaticanOPINIONIn the days of John F. Kennedy, the Democrats emphasized their political distance from the pope. Kennedy promised Americans that he would never let the pope influence him on “matters of public policy.” How times have changed. Today’s Democrats boast of their political alliance with Pope Francis. They openly confer with him on matters of public policy, as evident in Joe Biden’s latest visit to the Vatican. After he met with the pope last Friday, Biden praised him for “fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic...
__label__4 Should menthol cigarettes be banned?The Food and Drug Administration announced last week that it would begin the process of banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. The move comes after years of public pressure and legal challenges from anti-smoking groups aimed at compelling the FDA to follow through on its own recommendation that menthol cigarettes be banned. Menthol is a substance that can be derived from mint plants or created synthetically. It was first added to cigarettes in the 1920s, when manufacturers learned that in addition to its flavoring, menthol creates a cooling sensation in...
__label__3 Democrats to Propose a Border Tax Based on Countries’ Greenhouse Gas EmissionsDemocratic lawmakers on Monday will make public a plan to raise as much as $16 billion annually by imposing a tax on imports from China and other countries that are not significantly reducing the planet-warming pollution that they produce.The tax would be levied regardless of whether Congress passed new laws to reduce emissions created by the United States. It would be designed to be approximately equivalent to the costs faced by American companies under state and federal environmental regulations.

The story is the same as thousands that precede it. Gruden is just another scalp on the woke culture warriors’ walls. The New York Times is proud of their reporting that brought down the Super Bowl-winning coach. There’s nothing new to these cancellation tactics, and we’ll see the cackling hyenas in the left-wing press pursue more scalps in the near future. This story does, however, reveal the warped moral...

The Idea Could Reshape Industries.ANALYSISGovernments in the U.S., Europe and other developed nations are embarking on a climate change experiment: using tariffs on trade to cut carbon emissions. The idea has the potential to rewrite the rules of global commerce.Policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking at targeting steel, chemicals and cement. The tariffs would give a competitive advantage to manufacturers in countries where emissions are relatively low.
__label__2 Child tax credit payments go out July 15. Here's what you need to knowThe Internal Revenue Service is set to begin sending the expanded child tax credit payments on July 15 to tens of millions of families, providing them with extra funds each month through the end of 2021 along with a tax break next year. The payments were approved as part of the Democrats' $1.9 trillion stimulus package that President Joe Biden signed into law in March. The infusions may offer the greatest benefit to low-income families, cutting child poverty nearly in half -- but the extra cash will also go to better-off American families. Here are four things you need to...

But I didn’t need them. I was two months past a major surgery, one month into chemotherapy, and fully aware of my own vulnerability and weakness and the possibility of death. Sitting alone, forcing myself to eat and drink as my doctor had commanded, I prayed for my life. The psychotherapist Irvin Yalom, in his book Love’s Executioner, writes: We know about death, intellectually...
__label__4 Should Democrats have embraced the billionaire tax?As congressional Democrats ironed out the details of their ambitious social spending and infrastructure package, the lawmakers considered a novel proposal for paying for it: a billionaire tax. But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans. Under current law, assets like stocks are subject to...
__label__3 How the rich avoid paying taxesANALYSISIn the US, most people make their money from a regular job; they get a paycheck and pay income taxes. But the richest Americans, the top 1 percent, make most of their money from things like investments in real estate or the stock market. Those investments are taxed as capital gains. While federal income tax has a maximum tax rate of 37 percent, the tax rate for capital gains tops out at just 20 percent. It’s why Warren Buffett, one of the richest people in America, has often said that...
__label__2 The half-angel, half-demon connected to Yom KippurOPINIONYou may or may not be aware that the word Azazel is often used in modern Hebrew in a similar function to the word “Hell” in English — as in a place where you can tell someone particularly annoying to go to. Some of you may also have heard of the ancient Jewish practice, dating from before the destruction of the Temple, of se’ir la’azazel (“a goat for Azazel“), the ritual of sending a goat into the wilderness as atonement for the sins of the people, hence the term scapegoat. But did you know that...
__label__4 Democrats' billionaires tax explainedANALYSISThere is now legislative language behind the push to tax American billionaires on unrealized capital gains, as Sen. Ron Wyden last night released his 107-page plan. Why it matters: This would be a sea change in U.S. tax policy, which has only applied to realized gains (otherwise known as income). Wyden's proposal would apply to those with more than $1 billion in assets or more than $100 million in adjusted gross income over three consecutive years. The biggest tax bills would come up front, charging a long-term cap gains rates on all...
__label__3 As Bezos called for tax hikes, Amazon lobbied to keep its tax bill lowAs Amazon publicly embraced President Joe Biden’s plan to raise the corporate tax rate across the board, it has also lobbied Congress to preserve a prized tax break that’s helped it lower its corporate tax bill. The retail giant’s founder Jeff Bezos earned plaudits earlier this year when he announced that Amazon would back “a rise in the corporate tax rate” to help pay for Biden’s infrastructure package. His comments broke with most of the rest of corporate America — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable vehemently opposed...
__label__2 How this new group for Christian lawmakers will try to remake American politicsA decade ago, Jason Rapert — founder and president of the National Association of Christian Lawmakers — was in a hotel room in Destin, Florida, at the end of a ministry conference. The minister and missionary, who, at the time, also worked for a brokerage firm, felt called to run for office. He’d been praying for weeks about whether or not to throw his hat into the political ring. The answer came to him that night in a Florida Hilton. “God said to me, ‘Why are you not sacrificing to...

The so-called billionaires tax, announced by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, is part of a two-pronged legislative strategy that also includes a proposed 15% corporate minimum tax on the most profitable U.S. corporations, which was unveiled on Tuesday. Wyden and other lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, say the legislation is intended to curtail...

__label__5 Democrats Weigh Tax Alternatives to Fund $2 Trillion PackageDemocrats worked to quickly find new sources of revenue to pay for their roughly $2 trillion social-policy and climate package, seeking to target businesses and wealthy individuals in novel ways after proposed rate increases ran aground in talks. The continued opposition by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) to any increases in top marginal rates on corporations, individuals or capital gains has emerged as a major hurdle in the party’s quest to reach a new framework on the legislation. A person familiar with Ms. Sinema’s thinking said she has agreed to enough alternative...

Executives at the toolmaker’s New Britain, Conn., headquarters already had shifted most production of heavy-duty industrial products closer to customers in the United States and Europe. But efforts to do the same with Stanley’s popular hand tools were unfinished when the coronavirus pandemic began disrupting global commerce. This year, as ports grew clogged, Stanley saw its freight bills jump by a factor of seven, endured months-long shipping delays and scrambled to obtain computer chips...
__label__2 Corporate Media Don’t Understand Religion For The Same Reason They Don’t Understand America: PoliticsOPINIONIt's no wonder the left and its defenders and scribes in corporate media don't understand Catholicism. Through the lens of American politics, how could they? Newspaper readers and news-watchers these past few weeks have been treated to a running analysis from pundits and reporters on whether Catholic politicians should be under different rules than the other billion less-famous Catholics. It’s not shocking that The New York Times and their friends think the Catholic Church ought to abandon millennia of moral teaching to suit Western left-wing policies, but a funny thing...
__label__5 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...

The group of developed nations agreed to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.

You could get one of four kinds of letters: CP 11, CP 12, CP 13, or letter 6470. None of them is likely to contain good news. The Taxpayer Advocate Service says 9 million Americans have gotten notices from the IRS that say the government is billing them for payment due to a “math error.” 7.4 million of the errors were due to pandemic-era stimulus overpayments. But wait, there’s more. Financial experts...

Biden will meet virtually Wednesday with industry leaders before delivering a speech on the administration’s efforts to address the bottlenecks. The supply-chain mess risks creating new economic...
__label__2 US Catholic Bishops to Debate Giving Communion to Pro-Choice PoliticiansThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week are expected to discuss if pro-choice Catholic politicians should be able to receive Holy Communion. The topic has received renewed attention in the past year because President Joe Biden, the second Roman Catholic to hold that office, attends Mass regularly and receives Holy Communion. The Vatican has warned the bishops not to deny communion to politicians supportive of abortion rights, according to The New York Times. In 2004, the bishops published a statement that said local bishops could decide whether to deny Holy...
__label__5 The wealthy may avoid $163 billion in taxes every year. Here’s how they do itThe wealthiest Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in income taxes every year, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and many leverage tax laws to do it legally, financial experts say. Although U.S. levies increase with income, the ultra-wealthy often finesse the tax code to reduce how much they owe. And some billionaires, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, pay little to no taxes compared to their wealth, a ProPublica report found.  “As long as you’re adhering to the law, everything’s fair game,” said certified...

Game consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X are impossible to find. And even things like microwaves and refrigerators are impacted, because they contain simple controller chips. So we realized it was time to figure out what caused the chip...

__label__5 Top 1% dodge $163 billion in annual taxes, Treasury estimatesThe top 1% of Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in annual taxes, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  This estimate widens the so-called tax gap — the shortfall between how much is owed and collected — to $600 billion every year, the report outlines. The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...

The agencies purchased blacklisted hardware through a network of American resellers that claimed the camera systems were in compliance with the sanctions. Those claims in numerous cases had little apparent basis, according a joint investigation with IPVM, a video surveillance industry research publication.

__label__2 VA Teacher Placed On Administrative Leave After Refusing To Affirm Trans Identity For Kids, Citing FaithAn elementary school teacher in Virginia was placed on administrative leave this week after refusing to affirm transgender identities in children, claiming such behavior is against his faith and “defiles the holy image of God.” Byron “Tanner” Cross, who teaches physical education at Leesburg Elementary School, explained to the Loudoun County school board Tuesday that he will not “affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa” because he loves children who struggle with gender dysphoria and refuses to lie to them, according to Fox News.

On July 15, cash flowed into the bank accounts of parents across the U.S. as the government rolled out the first monthly payments of the enhanced child tax credit passed by Congress this spring. But as helpful as those payments are to a lot of families, they could actually create headaches for others, with some people owing money to the government next year. As a result, some parents have already opted out of the monthly payments and are instead choosing to receive the...
__label__2 Democrats to Propose a Border Tax Based on Countries’ Greenhouse Gas EmissionsDemocratic lawmakers on Monday will make public a plan to raise as much as $16 billion annually by imposing a tax on imports from China and other countries that are not significantly reducing the planet-warming pollution that they produce.The tax would be levied regardless of whether Congress passed new laws to reduce emissions created by the United States. It would be designed to be approximately equivalent to the costs faced by American companies under state and federal environmental regulations.
__label__2 Biden To Skip Notre Dame Commencement Amid Furor Over Policies That Defy Church TeachingsPresident Joe Biden on Sunday will break a 20-year tradition of a president or vice president delivering a commencement address at the University of Notre Dame during the first year of a new presidency. Sources at the White House claimed the school had invited Biden to speak, but said the nation’s second Roman Catholic president is unable to attend because of a scheduling conflict, according to the Catholic News Agency (CNA). Jimmy Dunne, who is a finance executive and trustee of the university, will address the graduates instead.
__label__5 Can Biden’s child tax credit really cut child poverty in half?More than 35 million American families were sent checks of up to $300 per child on Thursday as the new expanded child tax credit went into effect. Roughly $15 billion was disbursed to the families of nearly 60 million children as part of this first wave of checks, which will be sent monthly through at least the end of the year. Passed by Democrats in March as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the new program increases the size of the existing child tax credit — from $2,000 per child to $3,600...
__label__3 The FTC is reportedly poised to probe Amazon’s MGM acquisitionFollowing Amazon’s recent acquisition of MGM, the deal will reportedly be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission — meaning Lina Khan, a long-outspoken critic of Amazon who recently became FTC chair, will have oversight over the deal. The proceedings could signal how she’ll handle antitrust cases against Amazon in the future. Citing people familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the FTC requested oversight of the deal during negotiations between agencies specifically because it is currently overseeing the ongoing antitrust probe. According to the WSJ, the Justice Department and FTC have...
__label__2 Joe Biden Finally Condemns Surge of Antisemitic Attacks After Ignoring Jewish GroupsPresident Joe Biden condemned the rise of antisemitic attacks in the United States on Monday, three days after Jewish groups begged him to do so. “The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop,” Biden wrote on social media. “I condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad — it’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.” But on Friday the president ignored a group letter from The Jewish Federations of North America, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American Jewish Committee, Hadassah,...
__label__5 Four ways in which Biden’s new child tax credit will impact inequalityThe US federal government’s $1.9 trillion relief package that President Joe Biden signed on March 11 will temporarily expand the child tax credit. This credit, currently pegged at up to $2,000 a year per child until they turn 17, will instead total $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for kids up to the age of 18 over the next 12 months. Starting in July, the Internal Revenue Service will distribute half this money to most families with children in monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child. The IRS will deliver the balance...
__label__3 Did Macron Scold Biden at NATO Summit?FACT CHECKIn June 2021, world leaders from dozens of countries met in Brussels for the 31st formal meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). U.S. President Joe Biden held a number of bilateral meetings and news conferences during the event, and although a number of world leaders made remarks praising the American president — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Biden was “a big breath of fresh air,” and French President Emmanuel Macron said it was “great to have a U.S. president who’s part of the club” — some Biden critics focused...

__label__5 Cuba protests: Tax on food and medicine imports liftedCuba says it will allow travellers arriving in the country to bring in food, medicine and other essentials without paying import duties. The announcement was made following the biggest anti-government protests on the Communist-run island in decades. Thousands took to the streets on Sunday to protest over food and medicine shortages, price increases and the government's handling of Covid-19. There will be no limit on such goods brought in by travellers from Monday. However, the measure is only temporary and has been derided as "too little, too late" by critics...
__label__3 China’s Trade Boom Continues in May on Strong Global DemandExports grew almost 28% in dollar terms in May from a year earlier, the customs administration said Monday, weaker than forecast and below the pace in April, but still well above historical growth rates. Imports soared 51.1%, the fastest pace since March 2010, leaving a trade surplus of $45.5 billion for the month.
__label__2 There Is No Way To ‘Fix’ The Equality Act. It’s Identity Politics Or Equality Before The Law, And Republicans Must ChooseANALYSISThere can be no compromise with those whose political program requires erasing American citizens' constitutionally guaranteed rights to freely speak and freely worship.  On May 15, Fox News reported that three Republican senators would like to write caveats into the Equality Act that might give them the political cover to vote for the bill to criminalize free speech and Christianity in the United States. “Representatives from the offices of Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio and Susan Collins, R-Maine, met with groups including the U.S. Conference of Catholic...
__label__5 UN Warns Of Soaring Prices In 2022 Due To Freight Rate SpikeThe United Nations warned Thursday that a surge in container freight rates could mean higher prices for consumers next year unless pandemic-fuelled problems are untangled.The UN's trade and development agency (UNCTAD) said global import price levels could increase by 11 percent and consumer price levels by 1.5 percent between now and 2023."Global consumer prices will rise significantly in the year ahead until shipping supply chain disruptions are unblocked and port constraints and terminal inefficiencies are tackled," UNCTAD said in its Review of Maritime Transport 2021 report.
__label__3 China’s Xi warns against ‘new Cold War’Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned global leaders against starting a “new Cold War” and urged unity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.“To build small cliques or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others … will only push the world into division,” said Xi at an all-virtual Davos forum on Monday.
__label__2 Biden Administration Walks Back Regulation Protecting Single-Sex Homeless SheltersThe Biden administration is cracking down on single-sex homeless shelters in a move that critics say will harm religious shelters and present a threat to women's safety. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said Thursday that it will roll back a Trump administration policy that it said "would have allowed for HUD-sanctioned, federally funded discrimination against transgender people." The policy change requires shelters to accommodate individuals regardless of sex or gender orientation. Any shelter that receives grant money from the department's Office of Community Planning and Development is required...
__label__4 Biden Asks FTC to Examine Oil, Gas Companies’ Role in High Gasoline PricesPresident Biden called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether oil-and-gas companies are participating in illegal conduct aimed at keeping gasoline prices high.In a Wednesday letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan, Mr. Biden alleged that there is “mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil-and-gas companies.” He said gasoline prices are rising even as the price of unfinished gasoline goes down.
__label__3 A Speculative Frenzy Is Sweeping Wall Street and World MarketsAnimal spirits are famously running wild across Wall Street, but crunch the numbers and this bull market is even crazier than it seems.Global stocks are now worth around $100 trillion. American companies have raised a record $175 billion in public listings. Some $3 trillion of corporate bonds are trading with negative yields.
__label__2 Voters Are Done With COVID-19 and Pandemic-Powered OfficialsANALYSISPoliticians have been on a high over the last year-plus, wielding extraordinary power with the approval of voters fearful of viral infection. Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...
__label__5 Warehouses are overwhelmed by America's shopping spreeDoug Kiersey has been building, buying and leasing warehouses for almost 40 years. He's never seen a time like this. "It's completely unprecedented," says Kiersey, president of Dermody Properties, which owns warehouses used by some of the country's largest retailers. "In some markets ... we're over 99% occupancy." In simplest terms, America's warehouses are running out of space. It's all claimed and bursting at the seams. How did that happen? Warehouses have become a key middle link in the country's supply chain. Couches, phones, floorboards and virtually everything else a...
__label__3 Global trade is booming — just without the U.S.OPINIONThe world is turning its back on globalization, free trade and multilateral institutions — or at least that’s the conventional wisdom. Inspired by the nationalism and protectionism of President Trump and spurred on by the covid-19 pandemic, politicians and commentators’ talk of bringing home supply chains and bolstering domestic production. Even without Trump, the thinking goes, this shift is likely to endure.
__label__2 Here Are The Conservatives Suing Biden Over His ‘Unconstitutional’ Vaccine CoercionANALYSISAt least 19 states have already begun to legally pursue action against the Biden administration for forcing medical coercion on federal contractors but following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s new emergency temporary standard demanding employers with 100 or more workers mandate the jab, others are looking to sue too. OSHA’s explicit threat that the rule could eventually extend to smaller businesses in the near future has also pushed politicians, attorneys, and business owners to take legal action. Here are the conservatives who are suing Biden and his administration for forcing the COVID-19 jab...
__label__4 Biden rolls out multibillion-dollar plan to upgrade aging U.S. ports after passage of infrastructure billThe Biden administration outlined several initiatives on Tuesday aimed at addressing immediate supply-chain challenges and other disruptions affecting global commerce. Several senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share details of the proposed plans, said the administration will begin work within the next 60 days with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on $4 billion worth of construction work at coastal ports, inland waterways as well as other corps eligible facilities. The plan will identify and prioritize $3.4 billion in upgrades to obsolete inspection...
__label__3 New US lawsuits could force Facebook to sell Instagram, WhatsAppThe United States Federal Trade Commission and nearly every US state sued Facebook Inc on Wednesday, saying it violated antitrust law and should potentially be broken up.With the filing of the twin lawsuits, Facebook becomes the second big tech company to face a major legal challenge this fall.
__label__1 19 States Sue Biden Administration Over COVID-19 Vaccine MandateSeveral U.S. states on Friday mounted multiple federal lawsuits against the Biden administration over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors. Texas sued individually in a federal court in Galveston. Another lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Missouri involves Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Yet another lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Georgia, involves Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia. The lawsuits come a day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he sued the administration over the same vaccine mandate. As of late Friday, the total number of...
__label__4 Tariffs to Tackle Climate Change Gain Momentum. The Idea Could Reshape Industries.ANALYSISGovernments in the U.S., Europe and other developed nations are embarking on a climate change experiment: using tariffs on trade to cut carbon emissions. The idea has the potential to rewrite the rules of global commerce.Policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking at targeting steel, chemicals and cement. The tariffs would give a competitive advantage to manufacturers in countries where emissions are relatively low.
__label__3 The Possibility of Life Without MoneyANALYSISAwhile back, I wrote an article on the decommodification of the toilet. In Europe, people often have to pay to use public toilets. I was surprised on a visit to England when, in a country that offers totally free public healthcare, I had to fumble in my pockets for coins just to take a “wee.” (As the expulsion of urine is known in my home country.) In the United States, this experience is unknown, because there was a successful, unsung social movement to abolish paid toilets. I pointed out in...
__label__2 China’s Vain Struggle For Covid ZeroOPINIONIn pursuit of the mythical Covid zero, China is now pushing vaccines on children as young as three years old. Thus far, China has administered more than 2.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines—almost three times more than India, the country that has doled out the second most Covid jabs. More than 70 percent of China’s 1.4 billion population is fully vaccinated. China’s two most widely used Covid-19 vaccines, the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, were approved for use in children from ages three to 17 over the summer; however, China has been somewhat hesitant to vaccinate children...
__label__4 U.S. and EU agree to ease metal tariffs imposed by Trump administrationThe United States and the European Union on Saturday announced an easing of a trade dispute that started during the Trump administration. The previous U.S. administration imposed a 25% tariff on European steel and another 10% tariff on aluminum in June 2018 on the grounds of national security. The EU vehemently contested the move from the start and after multiple failed attempts to reach a deal with the Trump administration, the bloc took the case to the World Trade Organization and imposed retaliatory measures on up to 6.4 billion euros ($7.78 billion)...
__label__3 Democrats Face Economic Gut-Check After GOP Taps Voters’ AngstANALYSISDemocrats will argue for months about what led to their defeat at the ballot box on Tuesday -- whether it was their messaging, their candidates or their president. But there was consensus that the first step is to get something done on economic issues. One day after an embarrassing loss in the Virginia gubernatorial election and a dispiritingly tight race in New Jersey, Democrats from President Joe Biden to moderate and progressive members of Congress cast passage of his infrastructure and $1.75 trillion social spending package as a panacea for...
__label__1 Los Angeles Orders Local Businesses To Serve as Vaccination EnforcersANALYSISOn Wednesday evening, the Los Angeles City Council voted 11–2 to approve a new ordinance forcing local businesses and venues to demand that patrons provide proof they've been vaccinated for COVID-19. People who want to eat dinner in a restaurant, see a movie, get their hair styled, or spend any significant amount of time inside an indoor business will be required to provide documentation that they've been vaccinated. You'd think that Los Angeles taking such drastic measures is an indicator that there's a struggle here to get people vaccinated or that the city and...
__label__4 How the first truly continental railroad could change North American tradeFreight trains may soon travel more easily between Canada, the US, and Mexico after Canadian Pacific Railway finalized a deal to buy Kansas City Southern, positioning itself to become the first rail network connecting the three countries.The agreement, which is valued at $27 billion, comes after a lengthy battle between Canadian Pacific and its rival, Canadian National, which submitted a $30 billion counter-offer to Kansas City Southern in March that was ultimately rejected by a US regulatory panel.
__label__3 Republicans Once Supported the Voting Rights Act. Today, They Voted Against its Restoration.ANALYSISOn Wednesday afternoon, GOP senators blocked Democrats from advancing a key voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, marking the second time in two weeks and the fourth time this year that Republicans have filibustered voting rights legislation that would combat GOP voter suppression efforts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it a “low, low point in the history of this body.” Republicans have now prevented three different voting rights bills introduced by Democrats from reaching the Senate floor. This repeated obstruction is likely to embolden top...
__label__2 Nebraska says it opposes IRS snooping in Biden’s $3.5T spending planAs if this bill didn’t have enough problems … Hidden in President Biden’s $3.5 trillion budget plan is a provision that would authorize the Internal Revenue Service to snoop on Americans’ bank accounts. Nebraska state Treasurer John Murante said his state is leading the charge in objecting to the proposal that would compel banks to report ​private ​customers’ account​s with at least $600 of transactions to the IRS​.​ “My message is really simple. The people of Nebraska entrusted me to protect the privacy of these accounts and I am not going to...
__label__5 Major automakers fear the global chip shortage could persist for some timeCar manufacturers including Ford, Volkswagen and Daimler are still struggling to deal with the impact of the global chip shortage, with executives from each of the companies warning a lack of silicon is likely to remain a problem. Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius and Ford Europe chairman of the management board Gunnar Herrmann told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach at the Munich Motor Show on Monday that it’s hard to tell when the complex issue will be resolved. Germany’s Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, has lost market share in China as a result of the...
__label__3 Maricopa County Audit Did Not Find 712,152 New Trump VotesFACT CHECKSince June 23, 2021, a political Facebook post has been shared at least tens of thousands of times. The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona. It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden’s Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes. In November 2021, the same misleading Maricopa County audit post was shared again, thrusting it back into the spotlight. For example, it was shared by...
__label__1 How Will Courts React to Biden’s Increasingly Imperial Presidency?OPINIONThe history of the United States, insofar as concerns the vitality of civil rights in times of crisis, can be summed up succinctly. While a crisis ensues, when there is a real perception of threat to our security, the courts give the executive a wide berth. They don’t exactly turn a blind eye. It’s more like slow-walking. Cases claiming infringement of fundamental liberties may be rushed into the justice system during a crisis, but courts will proceed cautiously. Sometimes they’ll wait to issue rulings until the security threat has passed. In the...
__label__4 Tense U.S.-China meeting ends, Beijing official says relations are in a ‘stalemate’Another high-level meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials — this time in the Chinese city of Tianjin, just outside of Beijing — concluded Monday with criticism from both sides. Before the talks even ended, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Monday the two countries’ relationship “is now in a stalemate and faces serious difficulties.” “Fundamentally, it is because some Americans portray China as an ‘imagined enemy,’” the ministry’s English-language release said. “We urge the United States...
__label__3 Right-wing media have spent a year trying to discredit the 2020 presidential election in promotion of the Big LieOPINIONIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, former President Donald Trump and allied right-wing media figures worked hard to undermine the election results, using broad and debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud and supposed Democrats’ efforts to steal the vote. Protests against the election process, like Ali Alexander’s “Stop the Steal," were mobilized nationwide in the weeks before Election Day. And in the final presidential debate, Trump went as far as to baselessly claim,“This is going to be a fraud like you have never seen.”  The efforts have continued since the election. From November 3, 2020, to October 28, 2021, Media...
__label__2 Separation of powers is supposed to stop tyranny. But is it eroding?OPINIONHarry Truman had a problem. Two years earlier, he had sent American troops across the Pacific to defend South Korea against a communist invasion from the North. He did so without a formal declaration of war or any other authorization from Congress. This might pose a constitutional problem, but Truman had a concrete problem as well. Thousands of American soldiers, on his watch, were fighting a bloody overseas war. To win, they needed tanks, guns and other weaponry. And to procure such armaments, Truman needed steel. That was his problem....
__label__4 How the FTC can start curbing Amazon’s powerANALYSISWith Lina Khan’s confirmation as chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), she now has the authority to curb Amazon’s mounting power. Achieving this goal could very well become Khan’s legacy, but it will happen only if the commission and the judiciary fully understand Amazon’s business model and the speed with which it is executed.

__label__1 Where Does Biden Get the Authority To Mandate Vaccination?ANALYSISPresident Joe Biden decreed on Thursday that private companies with more than 100 workers would have to make it a condition of employment for them to get vaccinated—either that, or take weekly tests for the virus. You may wonder: On what authority can Biden order this? The White House is relying on the regulatory authority of the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency dating back to 1971, and in particular its seldom-used emergency powers. Some backers of Biden's action seem to think waving in OSHA's general direction,...
__label__5 New FTC chair already rocking boatsBy naming tech critic Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission Tuesday, the White House made clear it is dead serious about antitrust enforcement and other measures to rein in Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.The intrigue: By naming Khan FTC chair just hours after the Senate confirmed her appointment as one of five commissioners at the agency, the White House took both the industry and many D.C. insiders by surprise.
__label__3 Republicans Are Passing Rigged Maps and Democrats Are Running Out of Time to Stop ItIt took Texas Republicans less than 30 days to pass redistricting maps for Congress and the state legislature that will help them retake the US House in 2022 and entrench control of state politics for the next decade. Meanwhile, it’s been 230 days since the House of Representatives passed federal legislation—the For the People Act—that would roll back the gerrymandering and voter suppression enacted by GOP-controlled states such as Texas, but the Senate has taken no action to protect voting rights while Republican-dominated states relentlessly undermine them. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled...
__label__1 Biden, Dems Want To Monitor Americans’ Bank Accounts, Blasted As Violating 4th AmendmentPresident Biden and the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget plan means to monitor gross inflows and outflows from Americans’ bank accounts, prompting concern that the federal government would be willfully violating the 14thAmendment. “The proposal would require banks to report to gross inflows and outflows to the IRS, including transactions from Venmo, PayPal, crypto exchanges and the like in an effort to fight tax evasion,” The Daily Mail noted, adding, “The IRS would know how much money is in an individual’s bank account in a given year, whether the individual earned income on...
__label__4 The importance of USMCA for the Biden administration’s economic and foreign policyANALYSISIn her confirmation hearing, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai stated that “trade is like any other tool in our domestic or foreign policy. It is a means to create more hope and opportunity.” With this in mind, President Biden has made clear that trade must improve wages and create higher-paying jobs for all Americans as he focuses on controlling COVID-19, restoring economic growth and employment, and expanding opportunity by investing in education, R&D, and infrastructure. In this respect, there is no more important regional trade agreement for the U.S. than...
__label__3 Last Chance to Save American DemocracyOPINIONSenator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, has indicated that he plans to schedule a vote for Wednesday to open debate on a new voting rights bill, the Freedom to Vote Act. The bill would set national standards for early voting, expand voting by mail, allow the use of more forms of voter identification, make Election Day a federal holiday and institute measures to counter voter suppression tactics. It would also automate voter registration, force states to give voters the option to register on Election Day and offer safeguards against voter purges. Finally, it...
__label__2 White House: Companies that flout Biden’s vaccine mandate face ‘significant’ finesCompanies that refuse to comply with President Biden’s vaccine-or-testing mandate will face “quite significant” fines that exceed $10,000 for each violation, the White House said Friday. Mr. Biden told the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue rules mandating firms with 100 or more workers to require vaccination or weekly testing of those who refuse the shots. “If a workplace refuses to follow the standard, the OSHA fines can be quite significant. Enforcement actions include fines up to $13,600 per violation,” White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters. The...
__label__4 Supreme Court Cuts Federal Trade Commission Powers to Recover Ill-Gotten GainsThe Supreme Court on Thursday curbed the Federal Trade Commission’s longtime practice of seeking to recover ill-gotten gains in court from companies and individuals who cheat or mislead consumers, upending a central enforcement tool the agency has relied on for decades.The court, in an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled unanimously that a 1973 law, which gives the FTC the right to seek court injunctions to stop fraudulent or deceptive commercial activity, doesn’t grant the commission the power to seek financial judgments as well.
__label__3 With surgical precision, Republicans draw two congressional districts that dilute power of Hispanic and Asian votersANALYSISThe intensity with which Texas Republicans are struggling against demographic tides as they redraw the state's congressional districts can best be seen in their proposed maps for the Dallas-Fort Worth region, specifically its suburbs. For decades, suburban communities offered the GOP solid political ground. But census figures demonstrate the state is growing away from Republicans, with nearly all of its population gains coming within communities of color more likely to support Democrats. That shift has reached the suburbs. In a bid to hold the political turf, Republicans are zeroing in...
__label__1 COVID-19 Vaccination Should Not Be Legally Required for ParenthoodOPINIONA family court judge in Chicago denied a mother the right to custody over her son until she gets vaccinated against COVID-19, the implication being that an unvaccinated parent is not a fit parent. The ruling didn't hold long—the judge himself quickly reversed course—but the initial decision will be chilling for thousands of parents across the country. Making parental or child vaccination a requirement for custody would be an enormous judicial and government overreach, setting a dangerous precedent for intervention into what has traditionally been the realm of the family. This case...
__label__5 Suez Canal Traffic Backlog Finally Cleared Following The Ever Given SagaFive days after a skyscraper-sized container vessel was dislodged from the Suez Canal, the backlog of ships waiting to cross through the Egyptian waterway has been cleared, the canal authority says. When the 1,312-foot Ever Given ship ran aground March 23, it blocked canal traffic, grinding maritime shipping to a halt at one of the world's busiest waterways. During the six days the Ever Given remained stuck, more than 400 ships were stranded at the man-made canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. But after a flotilla of...
__label__3 David Shor Is Telling Democrats What They Don’t Want to HearOPINIONPresident Biden’s agenda is in peril. Democrats hold a bare 50 seats in the Senate, which gives any member of their caucus the power to block anything he or she chooses, at least in the absence of Republican support. And Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are wielding that leverage ruthlessly.But here’s the truly frightening thought for frustrated Democrats: This might be the high-water mark of power they’ll have for the next decade.

The Suez Canal Authority said in a statement Thursday that it had officially suspended traffic while efforts to dislodge the 1,300-foot Ever Given continued. The salvage operator working to free the ship said it could be weeks before it is refloated — raising the possibility of major new disruptions to global...
__label__3 What Happens When Local Election Administrators Believe Trump’s Big Lie?ANALYSISWith a wooden cross towering behind her, Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters took the stage on September 16 at the Appleton Christian Church. The crowd came to its feet, shouting cheers and chants of “Tina! Tina! Tina!” The moment was a triumphant return for the western Colorado community’s top elections official after weeks in self-imposed hiding. “This is all for you,” she said. “You’re the ones who came to me and said ‘Something is not right, will you please check into it.'” The remarks were her first public appearance in the county in over...
__label__2 Families Are Fleeing Government-Run SchoolsANALYSISThis fall may be the biggest moment of truth for public education since the 1970s. After seeing enrollment in government-run K-12 schools decline by 3 percent in COVID-marred 2020–21 (including 13 percent for kindergarten and pre-K), all while homeschooling tripled, the $122 billion question facing this new school year is whether that defection is an aberration or inflection point. Given the amount of time that families have now had to plan around school-opening policies that have been among the most cautious in the developed world, would they choose their neighborhood school, or seek alternative solutions...
__label__4 Transatlantic alliance due for a reset. But what about China?ANALYSISAs tweets go, certainly by the standards of the outgoing Trump administration, it was downright benign, the cyber equivalent of a tap on the shoulder. Yet it heralds a key diplomatic challenge that awaits President-elect Joe Biden: forging a united response with America’s allies to the growing ambition and assertiveness of China. The tweet came from Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s choice for national security adviser. He was reacting to news that the European Union was poised, after nearly seven years of negotiations, to reach agreement in principle on a major...
__label__3 There’s a Bipartisan Voting Rights Bill. Yes, Really.A bipartisan elections bill is the rarest of creatures, one many Americans have never seen in the wild. Congressional Democrats are united behind sweeping voting rights legislation that won’t pass the Senate so long as the filibuster exists, because Republicans are united against it. Republican legislators in Texas, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere have passed numerous voting restrictions over united Democratic opposition. But on one sliver of voting issues, it seems lawmakers might — might! — be able to agree. The Native American Voting Rights Act, or NAVRA, was introduced in the House last month...
__label__2 Counterfeit vaccine cards will lead to total government surveillanceOPINIONU.S. Customs and Border Patrol announced its officers at a port in Alaska recently seized thousands of fake COVID-19 vaccination cards that came from China. The seizure opens the door for government to go forward with the technological tracking of U.S. citizens. How so? It strengthens the arguments of pro-vaccine passport types who say Americans must be vaccinated, or else risk infecting the innocent; that Americans must prove vaccination as conditions of associating freely in public and interacting with others; that vaccine passports are obviously the easiest means by which proof of...

After Wednesday's video meeting, von der Leyen tweeted:...
__label__3 Trump Campaign Knew Lawyers’ Voting Machine Claims Were Baseless, Memo ShowsTwo weeks after the 2020 election, a team of lawyers closely allied with Donald J. Trump held a widely watched news conference at the Republican Party’s headquarters in Washington. At the event, they laid out a bizarre conspiracy theory claiming that a voting machine company had worked with an election software firm, the financier George Soros and Venezuela to steal the presidential contest from Mr. Trump. But there was a problem for the Trump team, according to court documents released on Monday evening. By the time the news conference occurred...
__label__1 The Real Crimes Of Andrew CuomoANALYSISOn the Fourth of July in 2019, I joined some friends and some acquaintances for a picnic in Central Park. One of the former, who worked at a certain hub of globalist shenanigans, brought a colleague of hers from Italy. After exchanging pleasantries and establishing her country of origin, I mentioned that I didn’t much care for Italians, by which, of course, I meant Italian Americans. She asked why, and I explained the obvious reasons: Italians I had known were all walking stereotypes, loud and passionate and physical, with greased-back...
__label__4 Stocks ready to close out powerful 2020 as risks loom in JanuaryAt the close of trading next Thursday, the bull market will be ready to run into 2021 but probably at a slower pace. January is the month that Wall Street tradition says sets the tone for the year — “so goes January, so goes the year,” as the saynig goes. This January could be challenging, with the spreading pandemic slowing the economy and the important Georgia Senate run off elections on Jan. 5. On Jan. 20, Joseph Biden will be sworn in as president. “It’s a market that’s on end-of-year...
__label__3 The GOP Is Going After Pennsylvania Voters’ Most Sensitive DataANALYSISAfter months of pressure from former President Donald Trump, who lost the state but claims it was stolen, Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers are subpoenaing voter data as part of a shambolic probe into the 2020 election. As part of the subpoena, which passed a Republican-led state Senate committee Wednesday morning, legislators are seeking troves of information about the 2020 election: The names and dates of birth, addresses, and partial social security numbers of every registered voter in Pennsylvania as of November 2020 from the state Secretary of State, as well as...
__label__2 Why Don’t They Believe Us?OPINIONImagine you’re a normal person. The year is 2016. Rightly or wrongly, you believe most of what you see in the media. You believe polls are broadly reflective of public opinion. You believe doctors and scientists are trustworthy and independent. You’re a decent, reasonable person who follows the rules and trusts the authorities. Imagine your shock, then, when Brexit, which you were assured couldn’t happen because it was a fringe movement led by racists for racists, happens. The polls, which widely predicted it wouldn’t happen, were wrong. The experts and...
__label__4 Breakthrough: UK and EU reach post-Brexit trade agreementAfter months of talks and at almost the last minute, Britain and the European Union struck a provisional free-trade agreement Thursday that should avert New Year chaos for cross-border traders and bring a measure of certainty for businesses after years of Brexit turmoil. With just over a week until the U.K.’s final split from the EU, the British government said the “deal is done.” It said the deal was “the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU.” EU...
__label__3 Heeding Steve Bannon’s Call, Election Deniers Organize to Seize Control of the GOP — and Reshape America’s ElectionsOne of the loudest voices urging Donald Trump’s supporters to push for overturning the presidential election results was Steve Bannon. “We’re on the point of attack,” Bannon, a former Trump adviser and far-right nationalist, pledged on his popular podcast on Jan. 5. “All hell will break loose tomorrow.” The next morning, as thousands massed on the National Mall for a rally that turned into an attack on the Capitol, Bannon fired up his listeners: “It’s them against us. Who can impose their will on the other side?” When the insurrection...
__label__1 Top Biden Health Official: We're 'Failing' on COVIDWith the United States recording its highest daily Covid case load in six months, a top public health official warned Sunday that the country is "failing." "We should not really have ever got to the place we are," Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on ABC's "This Week." "In that regard, yes, we are failing." A surge in the highly transmissible Delta variant has brought a slew of bad news: total daily new cases have surged to 118,000, their highest since February; deaths are up 89...
__label__4 Venezuela judge orders prison time for 6 American oil executivesA Venezuelan judge sentenced six American oil executives to jail on Thursday after they were found guilty of corruption charges. The six Citgo executives were sentenced to more than 8 years in prison each after being asked to Venezuela for a business meeting three years ago, according to the Associated Press. Tomeu Vadell, Gustavo Cárdenas, Jorge Toledo, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano and Jose Pereira are all accused of embezzlement relating to a plan to refinance $4 billion in Citgo bonds that was never carried out. All the men are...
__label__3 What’s in the new Republican voting law that passed in Texas?ANALYSISOn August 31, both houses of the Texas Legislature passed an elections bill that inspired many of the state’s elected Democrats to flee Texas in an unsuccessful attempt to block the bill. The Texas Constitution requires two-thirds of each house’s members to be present in order to approve legislation, so Democrats delayed passage of this bill by preventing the state House from achieving a quorum. Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is an outspoken proponent of the election bill, known as SB 1, and is expected to sign it into law. SB 1 has...
__label__2 The Tyranny Of Smartphones And Dumb Covid PassportsOPINIONIn a striking passage near the beginning of his contribution to the Penguin History of the Church, R.W. Southern writes: The identification of the church with the whole of organized society is the fundamental feature which distinguishes the Middle Ages from earlier and later periods of history. At its widest limits it is a feature of European history from the fourth to the eighteenth century—from Constantine to Voltaire. In theory, during the whole of this period only orthodox and obedient believers could enjoy the full rights of citizenship. … Just as...

__label__3 ‘Democracy will be in shambles’: Democrats in last-ditch effort to protect voting rightsDemocrats are pushing what may be their last chance to hold off voter suppression efforts by Republicans, and say that their control of both the House and Senate is at risk if they do not pass their new legislation to protect elections. Their bill, which cleared the US House on a party-line vote last week, has now been taken up by a bitterly divided Senate. It would ensure that states with a recent history of voter suppression must obtain federal approval before making any changes to their election systems, while also undoing a...
__label__2 Liberals Hate That You Have RightsOPINIONThe bizarre contortions that the libs are going through to blame you for the virus because you selfishly refused to submit to their fussy commands illustrates, for the umpteenth time, an undeniable fact about these fascist-curious creeps. They hate hate hate the idea of rights, particularly yours. In fact, when they refer to rights, they often insist on encasing the word in quotation marks, as if it was some bizarre and alien concept those Jesus-gun-truck-cisnormative people from Iowabamaho invented under the influence of moonshine and the Holy Spirit. Rights, they...
__label__4 Biden Is Expected to Review Trump’s Trade TariffsWASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a U.S. trade policy characterized by tariffs on global imports—on steel and aluminum from most of the world, on wine and cheese from Europe, and on nearly three-quarters of everything the U.S. buys from China. While Mr. Biden hasn’t detailed his specific plans, aides and advisers say he is expected to review those levies. And like President Trump, he will largely be able to act without the need for Congressional support. Some of Mr. Biden’s campaign proposals are likely non-starters if Republicans maintain control of...
__label__3 Twitter blocked and labeled Donald Trump's tweets on election fraud. They spread anyway.ANALYSISTwitter blocked and labeled some of Donald Trump's claims of election fraud in the run-up and aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. The tweets spread on and off Twitter anyway. That’s according to a new study from New York University researchers published Tuesday in Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review and shared exclusively with USA TODAY. The study is raising questions about the ability of social media companies to halt the flood of falsehoods on mainstream social media platforms during election cycles. NYU researchers say Trump tweets with fact-check labels spread further on Twitter than those without. And...
__label__1 Taxes Separate Dying Illinois From Thriving MissouriANALYSISOn the I-57 highway through Illinois, time seems to go backward with each southbound mile. The houses and cars in the yards get older. As years pass, town populations shrink. Eventually, homes turn back into piles of disconnected wood and glass, then empty lots. At the end of the highway, the town of Cairo slowly sinks back into the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. A town of 15,000 people in the 1920s, Cairo now houses fewer than 2,000 residents. Today, the town is so silent that the few voices heard while...
__label__4 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...
__label__3 Arizona Audit Delayed Because Cyber Ninjas Have COVIDOPINIONThe long-awaited farce of an Arizona election audit is ending in tragedy. The Republican-controlled Arizona Senate was finally supposed to receive the report on its sham of an election fraud audit on Monday. But state Republicans announced that the report hadn’t been submitted—because the majority of the leaders of the conspiracy-minded Cyber Ninjas team that ran the so-called “audit” have caught COVID-19. “The team expected to have the full draft ready for the Senate today, but unfortunately Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan and two other members of the five-person audit...
__label__2 The Government’s License to LieANALYSISThe White House and Senate need to stop worrying about what people are sharing on Facebook and instead focus on winning back public trust. Last week, President Biden said Facebook was “killing people” because it hosted misinformation. He later backed off the comment, but the White House has been consistently putting pressure on social networks to deplatform people who, they believe, are getting in the way of their vaccination goals. Yesterday, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Luján introduced the Health Misinformation Act, which would open Facebook and other social-media networks to lawsuits...
__label__4 Fact Checking Donald Trump’s WSJ Letter to the EditorFACT CHECKOn October 27, the Wall Street Journal published a letter to the editor from Donald Trump, responding to “Pennsylvania’s 2020 Election.” In it, Trump maintains that the 2020 election was “rigged.” The former president recycled familiar—and previously debunked—voter fraud claims to make his case. In total, Trump makes 20 allegations of voter fraud, but the basis for most of these claims are not immediately clear.  First, Trump claims that in Pennsylvania “71,893 mail-in ballots were returned after Nov. 3, 2020, at 8 p.m.” He adds: “[N]one of these should have been counted according to...
__label__3 Texas Democrats return to state capitol, ending 38-day effort to block voting billAfter a 38-day walkout, Texas Democrats who fled the state capitol to block Republican efforts to pass harsh new voting restrictions returned to the floor of the state house of representatives. The house now has the required two-thirds of members necessary for a quorum to conduct legislative business, and Republicans have already scheduled a hearing on the voting bill for Saturday. The standoff reached a tipping point last week after Republicans authorized law enforcement to find and arrest their missing Democratic colleagues and lead them back to the capitol. Over the past few days,...
__label__2 The U.S. Has Strayed Far From Its Founding IdealsANALYSISGovernments at the state, local, and federal levels can obstruct our pursuit of happiness and at times even jeopardize our safety. Declaring their independence from British rule 245 years ago, the American colonists held "these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." They went on to announce, "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People...
__label__4 35 percent of voters in new poll say 2020 election should be overturnedThirty-five percent of registered voters said the results of the 2020 presidential election should be overturned, according to a new poll, nearly nine months after Congress certified President Biden's Electoral College win. The poll, conducted by Politico and Morning Consult, found that 22 percent of registered voters said the results of the 2020 presidential election should “definitely” be overturned, and 13 percent of those polled said they should “probably” be overturned. Forty-three percent of those polled said the results should “definitely not” be overturned, and 12 percent said they should “probably not” be overturned. Eleven...
__label__3 It Doesn’t Exclude Women to Acknowledge Everyone Who Can Get PregnantOPINIONTo say that abortion bans, like those recently passed in Texas, are part of a war on women is true. But to say they are a war on women alone is to erase the harm experienced by the transgender, intersex, nonbinary and gender expansive individuals whose lives are also deeply impacted by access to abortion and reproductive healthcare. Even though US District Judge Robert Pitman noted in his short-lived stay of the Texas ban, “The court recognizes that not all pregnant people identify as women,” very few major media outlets have made any change in how...
__label__2 It’s Time to Make the House BiggerOPINIONGeorge Washington had an uncanny knack for getting things right at the last minute. As general of the Continental Army, Washington defused a conspiracy within his officer corps to revolt at the tail end of the Revolutionary War in the spring of 1783. Such a military revolt could have snuffed out American democracy in its infancy. In his old age, Washington, who had owned slaves since he was a young boy, ensured that all of his slaves would be freed upon his wife Martha’s death through his will.
__label__4 The ‘profound power’ of vote by mail: Evolving a new ritual of democracyOregon’s former secretary of state, who pioneered the practice there, says reducing logistical hurdles to voting, and letting people fill out ballots in the comfort of their home, is good for democracy. Phil Keisling has been called “the Johnny Appleseed of mail-in ballots” and “the patron saint of vote by mail.” As Oregon’s secretary of state from 1991 to 1998, he pushed for the adoption of a then-unique system in which all active registered voters receive ballots through the postal system for all elections. Oregon’s vote by mail began as an experiment at the...
__label__3 ‘Catastrophic implications’: UN health expert condemns US over threat to abortion rightsThe United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health has called on the US supreme court to uphold the right to abortion in America or risk undermining international human rights law and threatening that right elsewhere in the world. The special rapporteur, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, is one of just a handful of global observers whose mandate is to travel the world defending human rights. Mofokeng has argued in a brief filed in a US court that overturning abortion rights would violate international human rights treaties ratified by the US, including the convention against torture,...
__label__2 Juneteenth Is a Good Holiday. Of Course the Government Is Screwing It Up.OPINIONMaking Juneteenth a national holiday really ought not to be controversial or complicated. Unfortunately, our political culture is dominated by a collection of incompetents and imbeciles for which nothing can pass without screw-ups and unnecessary outrage. Juneteenth—long celebrated in parts of America's black culture on June 19 but increasingly crossing over in the mainstream, as Reason's Zuri Davis detailed—marks the day in 1865 that the Union Army marched into Galveston, Texas, and freed roughly 250,000 slaves. Over the years, it has become a celebration of the snuffing out of chattel slavery within...
__label__4 Democrats' biggest push for voting rights fails with no Republicans on boardSenate Democrats' most forceful and perhaps last push for major voting rights legislation this year was blocked by a Republican filibuster on Wednesday afternoon. The procedural vote to move forward with the Freedom to Vote Act failed despite Democrats' effort to craft a compromise bill led in part by Sen. Joe Manchin. The West Virginia Democrat had hoped to get enough GOP votes to overcome a filibuster, but in the end no Republicans voted to advance the legislation. Democrats say federal voting legislation is needed to counteract a wave of new...
__label__3 NAACP urges pro athletes not to sign with teams in Texas over abortion and voting lawsThe NAACP is calling on professional athletes to reconsider signing with professional sports teams in Texas to protest the state's controversial voting and abortion laws.  In an open letter to the unions for the NBA, NFL, WNBA, MLB, and NHL, the NAACP urged athletes to consider the use of their platforms and positions as role models for kids across the country.  "Over the past few months, legislators in Texas have passed archaic policies, disguised as laws, that directly violate privacy rights and a woman's freedom to choose, restrict access to free and...
__label__1 How To Fix Big Tech Without Big GovernmentOPINIONPartisanship is at an all time high in Washington. But one issue policymakers on both sides seem to agree on is that something should be done to rein in the power of Big Tech. The American people also seem to agree, with a recent Gallup poll revealing a majority of both Republicans and Democrats favor increased regulation of the tech sector. Prominent conservatives are even abandoning their traditional rhetoric about limited government to join forces with progressives in calling for structural separation and expansive new regulations.  But how did...
__label__4 Senate Democrats are pushing a voting rights bill Republicans have vowed to blockSenate Democrats are set to try again to advance voting rights legislation on Wednesday, despite widespread opposition from Republicans. Democrats say federal voting legislation is needed to counteract a wave of new restrictions from Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country. Critics of those laws say they are making it more difficult to vote, particularly for people of color. "Democrats are ready to have this debate right now," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday, describing the legislation as a "a bill that every Senate Democrat is united behind, enthusiastically." The...
__label__3 The Supreme Court Won’t Halt Texas’s Abortion Ban While The Justices Decide If Anyone Can SueThe US Supreme Court will allow Texas’s six-week abortion ban to remain in effect for now, with a majority of the justices rejecting the Justice Department’s push to immediately pause enforcement of the law while constitutional challenges work through the lower courts. The order, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from, leaves intact a decision earlier this month by a federal appeals court that revived the law, SB 8, two days after a judge in Austin blocked it. It means that healthcare providers in Texas will remain barred from performing nearly all...
__label__1 If You Want To Fix the Country, Devolve PowerANALYSISRevived federalism is a start, but it doesn’t go far enough. It's a given in American politics that partisans become born-again believers in federalism when their faction is out of power in Washington, D.C., only to lose faith in decentralization the next time they win control of Congress and the presidency. Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it's refreshing to see in this deeply divided country at least tentative steps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issue should be settled by...
__label__4 Schumer, McConnell headed for another collision over voting rightsSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are headed for another clash over voting rights legislation next week and it’s expected to result in another stalemate on a top Democratic priority. Schumer announced in a “Dear Colleague” letter circulated Thursday morning that he will file cloture on Monday to set up a vote in the middle of next week on the Freedom to Vote legislation.  But McConnell on Thursday evening slammed the door on the idea of the bill picking up enough GOP support to move forward.
__label__3 Ending Roe Could Send More Women to Prison for MiscarryingOPINIONThe number of women in prison has skyrocketed over the last 40 years. Despite critical state level criminal justice reforms designed to keep people out of prison, both sexes have not benefited equally. Women currently go to prison at twice the rate of men. And now, a new threat to the over-prosecution and incarceration of women looms large in the, perhaps, unexpected forum of reproductive rights. This year alone, state legislators have introduced nearly 600 abortion restrictions, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood. Some of these laws,...
__label__1 Federal Judge Questions Dems Going After Trump's Tax ReturnsA Trump-appointed federal judge asked Democrats if they truly wanted to set the precedent of allowing Congress to view personal records of presidents or their family, warning a future Congress might be seeking to probe a Democrat or his family. "If Congress changes hands in a couple years here and a Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee asks for Hunter Biden's tax returns, are we just going to say, 'Oh, sure. You know, we've got to defer to Congress. They've said they're interested in legislating on presidential families,...
__label__4 Democrats unveil voting rights compromise billSenate Democrats on Tuesday introduced a pared-down voting bill — with support from both progressive and centrist wings of the party — aimed at expanding voter access and countering nationwide Republican-led efforts to alter election laws. Why it matters: The Freedom to Vote Act is the product of negotiations overseen by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and was built of a framework put forward by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose vote is crucial to Democratic efforts to advance legislation in the chamber. It is less expansive than the Democrats' previous voting rights push, which had failed...
__label__3 Texas’s anti-abortion law is back at SCOTUS. Here’s what’s different this time around.OPINIONOn October 14, the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit formally blocked a trial court’s decision halting SB 8, a Texas law banning most abortions in that state. On Monday, the US Justice Department, which sued to halt the Texas law, sought review of the Fifth Circuit’s thinly reasoned, single-paragraph order in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, where Republican appointees hold a 6-3 supermajority, is unlikely to do anything to restore abortion rights in Texas. Last month, a 5-4 Court handed down its own thinly reasoned, single-paragraph order permitting the Texas law to take effect....
__label__1 Biden plan to hire 80K IRS agents will backfire, letting wealthy dodge taxes, expert warnsPresident Biden’s proposed tax hikes and plan to hire more than 80,000 additional Internal Revenue Service agents could wind up helping the super-wealthy to avoid paying their fair share, according to a new analysis. The new system of tax hikes and credits that Democrats are championing in the $1.75 trillion social welfare and climate bill would also complicate the tax code and make enforcement difficult, said a report Thursday from the libertarian Cato Institute. The new complications, irrespective of beefed-up enforcement, do nothing to close the gap between taxes owed to the...
__label__5 Texas Gov. Abbott signs new voting restrictions into lawTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a sweeping voting bill on Tuesday, making it the latest state to approve stricter voting laws in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Why it matters: The law rolls back early voting and adds new ID requirements, which critics say disproportionally impact voters of color. Many of the bill's provisions take aim at expansions put in place in the populous, Democratic Harris County, where officials broadened access last year, per the Texas Tribune. The measure could also make it more difficult for people with disabilities to...
__label__3 Texas’s Six-Week Abortion Ban Is Back On After An Appeals Court Paused A Judge’s InjunctionTexas's six-week abortion ban is at least temporarily back in effect as of Friday night after a federal appeals court paused a lower court order from earlier this week that had halted enforcement of the law. The order from a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, granting what’s known as an “administrative stay,” isn’t permanent — the court will now decide whether to grant Texas’s request for a longer-term hold that would keep the law, SB 8, in effect while the state appeals its...
__label__2 IRS Adjusts Tax Brackets As Inflation Hits 30-Year HighThe Internal Revenue Service revealed that it would adjust federal income tax brackets and deductions in light of rising price levels in the United States. On Wednesday, the Department of Labor announced that year-over-year inflation for consumer prices reached 6.2% in October — the highest increase in thirty years. Prices for fuel, used vehicles, and food saw significant increases. Also on Wednesday, the IRS raised income tax rate thresholds for tax year 2022 to prevent “bracket creep” — defined by the Tax Foundation as inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets or reducing...
__label__5 After A Standoff With Democrats, Texas Republicans Pass New Voting RestrictionsTexas Republicans on Tuesday passed a series of new restrictions on the state's voting process, concluding a months-long legislative effort by sending the measure to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who plans to sign the bill into law. The passage of Senate Bill 1 came in the second special legislative session called by Abbott, following historic efforts by House Democrats to deny Republicans a quorum and block the changes. Twice, House Democrats left the state capitol. The second time, dozens of lawmakers fled to Washington, D.C., to make their case for...
__label__3 Back on the Bench, the Supreme Court Faces a Blockbuster TermA transformed Supreme Court returns to the bench on Monday to start a momentous term in which it will consider eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, vastly expanding gun rights and further chipping away at the wall separating church and state. The abortion case, a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks, has attracted the most attention. The court, now dominated by six Republican appointees, seems poised to use it to undermine and perhaps overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to...
__label__1 Democrat Cindy Axne Falsely Claims Biden’s $1.75T Agenda Will Cost Iowans ‘Literally Nothing’ANALYSISCLAIM: Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne (D-IA) claimed last week that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will cost Iowans “literally nothing.” VERDICT: False. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will stick Americans with trillions more in debt. “This cost Iowans literally nothing,” Rep. Axne said of the far-left’s agenda during an interview on Let’s Talk Guthrie County. “If you’re making under $400,000, you know what you’re going to get? A tax break. Because this bill is literally the first time in a long time that we’ve had a substantial approach to helping working...
__label__5 GOP leaders eye the future. GOP voters keep looking back.Political parties normally shrug off losses – even tough ones – and focus on future wins. But the GOP is finding that after 2020, many core voters are not willing to move on. The two dozen Kalamazoo County Republicans are rapt. They sit shoulder to shoulder in foldout chairs as the guest speaker at their party meeting, who bills himself as an IT expert from the West Coast, details allegations of fraud he claims occurred in Michigan during the 2020 presidential election. No such fraud occurred, according to a report from...
__label__3 Abortion Has Never Been Just About AbortionOPINIONAs recently as 1984, abortion was not a deeply partisan issue. “The difference in support for the pro-choice position was a mere six percentage points,” Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, told me by email. “40 percent of Democratic identifiers were pro-life, while 39 percent were pro-choice. Among Republican identifiers, 33 percent were pro-choice, 45 percent were pro-life and 22 percent were in the middle.” By 2020, Abramowitz continued, 73 percent of Democratic identifiers took the pro-choice position, while only 17 percent took the pro-life position, with 10 percent...
__label__1 Dems Abandon Billionaire Tax That Faced Constitutional HurdlesAn aborted Democratic plan to tax assets held by billionaires was vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds, experts told the Washington Free Beacon. The Constitution authorizes three forms of taxation, and tax-law gurus interviewed by the Free Beacon said the ill-fated billionaire's tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories. The measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year—like a stock or a closely held company—which aren't currently taxed until they're sold. Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) on Wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire's tax...
__label__4 ‘I had to stand up and say no’: Pro-choice Christians battle Texas lawAbortion is a complicated issue in many faith communities. One effect of Texas’ strict new abortion law, SB8, has been to spur people to wrestle more deeply with the topic – and to clarify their feelings around it. Growing up in a “super conservative” family in Tennessee didn’t lead the Rev. Gayle Evers to become a conservative pastor. Now based in Austin, Texas, she is co-pastor of Journey Imperfect Faith Community, and a chaplain for a group that ministers to LGBTQ people of faith and their families. She has been...
__label__3 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Has Issues With Incentivizing Abortion LawsuitsFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Senate President Walton Simpson are backing away from a key component of the Texas abortion ban after Florida state lawmakers announced that they would consider passing a similar bill. Florida Republicans plan to take up their own anti-abortion legislation early next year, but DeSantis has expressed some hesitation about details of the Texas bill, which provides financial incentives to private citizens who file suit against anyone assisting someone with an abortion. As it stands, private citizens in Texas can sue anyone involved in terminating a pregnancy...
__label__2 Democrats' Proposed 'Billionaire Tax' Is Definitely a Wealth Tax, and It May Be UnconstitutionalOPINIONPresident Joe Biden got himself elected partly by opposing the billionaires' wealth tax proposed during the primary campaign by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.). Now, in a reversal, Biden is preparing to embrace the idea. It wouldn't be the first time that a presidential candidate's plans changed after getting elected. The shamelessness of the way that Biden has shifted on the issue, though, is something else. It risks undercutting Biden's claim to being a voice of moderation. It also may reinforce voter cynicism. How's democracy supposed to...
__label__4 In Texas abortion cases, hints of new Supreme Court transparencyAs it hears two key cases and wades deeper into what’s poised to be a scrutinized term, the U.S. high court appears also to be more responsive to a public call for greater transparency. In a marathon three hours of oral arguments today, the United States Supreme Court continued its rapid handling of a controversial Texas law that effectively outlaws abortion in the state. The constitutional right to abortion is not at issue, but two cases brought in front of the court at breakneck speed still raise significant questions about...
__label__3 Mexico’s Supreme Court Votes to Decriminalize AbortionMexico’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that making abortion a crime was unconstitutional, setting a precedent for the legalization of abortion nationwide in a conservative Catholic country of about 120 million people. The unanimous ruling from the nation’s top court follows a growing women’s movement in Mexico that has repeatedly taken to the streets of major cities across the country, demanding greater rights and protections for women. “Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,” said Supreme Court Chief Justice Arturo Zaldivar after the decision was...
__label__2 Whose taxes are going up? White House considering 4 ways to pay for spending packageCongressional lawmakers are still hammering out a deal on President Biden’s multitrillion-dollar spending package that would boost funding for infrastructure and clean energy, along with social spending initiatives. The president said this week he has agreed to cut the mammoth $3.5 trillion price tag, and reports have suggested lawmakers will land somewhere between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion. But some Democratic legislators, like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Az., have said they will not agree to a package that includes tax hikes on corporations and high earners.

__label__5 U.S. Supreme Court hears challenges to Texas near-total abortion banThe U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Monday in challenges by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it - a novel design that has shielded it from being blocked by lower courts. Abortion rights in the United States are hanging in the balance as the nine justices take up the dispute over the Texas law barring abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy before hearing arguments on Dec. 1 over the...
__label__3 'Just the beginning': After Texas victory, anti-abortion rights activists could extend gainsANALYSISThe ripple effect after Texas’ highly restrictive anti-abortion law went into effect was immediate. Within 24 hours, legislators in at least six states — Florida, Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota — expressed interest in introducing similar legislation. With state legislatures out of session, most of the bills won’t be introduced right away. But abortion rights advocates say the threat to women’s reproductive freedom across the United States has already begun — and extends far beyond abortion. “It’s important to realize that the attacks on abortion are not the endgame for the anti-choice movement,” said Kristin Ford,...
__label__2 Yes, Biden Is Proposing That the IRS Spy on Your Bank RecordsOPINIONHere’s yet another example of why “fact-checking” is the most dishonest form of journalism. To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...
__label__4 Biden, Pope Francis Meet Amid Controversy Over AbortionPresident Biden, the second Catholic president in American history, traveled to the Vatican on Friday for a meeting with Pope Francis that is expected to focus on climate change but has been overshadowed by controversy among church leaders over the president’s support for abortion rights. Some U.S. bishops say that Catholic politicians who support legal access to abortion should be barred from Communion. In a little more than two weeks, at their annual fall meeting in Baltimore, U.S. bishops are expected to debate whether to make a collective statement to that effect. But...
__label__3 TikTok Users and Coders Flood Texas Abortion Site With Fake TipsAfter a Texas law restricting abortion went into effect on Wednesday, the state’s largest anti-abortion group publicized a website that invited citizens to inform on the law’s violators. The website, prolifewhistleblower.com, which was set up by the group Texas Right to Life, was designed to help carry out the new law. That’s because the law places enforcement not in the hands of state officials but with private citizens, who are deputized to sue anyone who performs or aids an abortion in violation of the law. Tips about the law’s potential offenders quickly...
__label__2 Dems Want to Soak the Rich by Snooping on the PoorOPINIONHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) snapped when asked Tuesday if the proposal to dramatically increase the surveillance capabilities of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would remain in the trillion-dollar social spending bill currently being negotiated among Democrats on Capitol Hill. "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes," the speaker said. Then she waved aside the questioner's accurate comment that banks have reported customer concerns about the idea that the IRS would scrutinize accounts with inflows and outflows as low as $600. "With all due respect, the plural of anecdote is not data," Pelosi said, disrespectfully. "Yes, there are...
__label__5 'We have to be heard': Texas women travel to seek abortionsThe 33-year-old Texas woman drove alone four hours through the night to get to the Louisiana abortion clinic for a consultation. She initially planned to sleep in her car, but an advocacy group helped arrange a hotel room. Single and with three children ranging from 5 to 13, she worried that adding a baby now would take time, food, money and space away from her three children. She doesn’t have a job, and without help from groups offering a safe abortion, she said, she probably would have sought another way...
__label__3 Democrats rush to find strategy to counter Texas abortion lawJoe Biden and top Democrats are scrambling for a strategy to counter Republican restrictions on women’s reproductive rights amid the fallout from a Texas statute that has banned abortions in the state from as early as six weeks into pregnancy – but the options available to the administration are thin. The conservative-dominated supreme court in a night-time ruling refused an emergency request to block the Texas law from taking effect, in a decision that amounted to a crushing defeat for reproductive rights and threatened major ramifications in other states nationwide. Even as...
__label__1 GOP Senators Call Out ‘Marriage Penalties’ In Democrats’ Spending BillRepublican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and 32 other GOP senators criticized the Democrats’ reconciliation bill Thursday for including “marriage penalties” in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.“Current marriage penalties occur when a household’s overall tax bill increases due to a couple marrying and filing taxes jointly,” the letter explained.
__label__5 Texas abortion law foes target lawmakers’ corporate donorsFoes of Texas’ strict abortion ban are taking aim at companies that donated money to the bill’s sponsors, hoping consumers will pressure corporate America to join the fight against a surge of restrictions. The television and digital ads begun this past week by the groups Corporate Accountability Action and American Bridge 21st Century, the Democratic Party’s opposition research arm, highlight AT&T’s contributions to Texas Republican lawmakers. There are plans to expand the campaign to Florida, where a similar abortion proposal has been introduced. Abortion rights supporters in Texas are confronting the nation’s strictest...
__label__3 The Texas Abortion Ban Is Just the BeginningANALYSISOn Monday and Tuesday, the rain in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was relentless. But on Wednesday morning, Hurricane Ida retreated for a little while, the sun reappeared with a vengeance, and the humidity stubbornly hung over the Southeast. At the West Alabama Women’s Center, it was business as usual, except for one thing: The protesters who usually clustered behind a series of white poles bordering the clinic’s parking lot had not reappeared. It felt like an ominous sign on a morning when the right to abortion access was once again being decimated....
__label__2 Biden Must Create New Taxes, Eliminate Natural Gas to Meet Climate Pledge, Analysts SayANALYSISPresident Joe Biden would need to implement a massive tax on emissions and conduct a near elimination of natural gas to meet his climate goals, according to left-leaning environmental experts. Biden will join world leaders at the United Nations' climate change conference in November to discuss his administration's pledge to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 50 to 52 percent by 2030. While a White House fact sheet claims the goal will "cut … energy costs for families," environmental experts contend Biden must enact policies that would raise taxes on everyday Americans to reach his...
__label__4 Abortion, religion, gun rights on agenda as Supreme Court starts new termThe Supreme Court begins a new nine-month term on Monday, with major cases on abortion, religion and gun rights on the docket. Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...
__label__3 Supreme Court declines to block Texas abortion lawA sharply and bitterly divided U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block a novel Texas law that opponents say could effectively outlaw abortion in the state. In an order and opinions issued just before midnight Wednesday, the justices revealed that they split 5-4 in refusing the request from abortion rights advocates to put the Texas law — which went into force early Wednesday — on hold while litigation over the measure proceeds. The court's majority said in an unsigned order that procedural issues related to the unusual private enforcement mechanism the law...

Schumer’s leadership team contradicted his claims Thursday that Democrats had agreed to a “framework” of tax hikes to pay for a $3.5 trillion expansion of the federal welfare state. Mr. Schumer’s closest allies, including Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, said they had not seen the framework or agreed to its contents. “I haven’t seen it,” said Mr. Durbin, Illinois Democrat. He was among several in the leadership team who said they weren’t part of an agreement. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Democratic Policy...
__label__4 The one case that could define the Supreme Court’s term – and legacyIs the law really the law, if change in personnel results in dramatic change? That’s the question Americans are grappling with as a momentous Supreme Court term opens this week. Justice Clarence Thomas, now the most senior member of the United States Supreme Court, admits he’s never been one to regularly hype the court.  “I’m quite content not to get out on the road,” he said last month, recalling a conversation years ago when his late colleague Justice Antonin Scalia encouraged him to get out “and fly the flag.” It...
__label__3 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...
__label__2 Biden's Plan To Crack Down on Tax Cheating: Snooping on Everyone's Bank AccountsANALYSISIn order to make sure the rich are paying their fair share in taxes, President Joe Biden says the IRS just needs two bits of information: all the money that goes into your bank account, and all the money that comes out. That's how Biden pitched his plan for a more comprehensive financial surveillance state—all to catch those nasty tax-cheating rich folks, of course—during a speech from the White House on Thursday afternoon. The plan "will give the IRS the resources it needs to keep up with the lawyers and...
__label__4 ’A Fetus at 6 Weeks Has No More Brain Than a Grain of Rice’FACT CHECKA viral Facebook post claims that “A fetus at 6 weeks has no more brain than a grain of rice.” The post references the Texas heartbeat abortion law, which prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually at six weeks. The first claim in the post—that a baby during the sixth week of gestation is the size of a grain of rice—is accurate. Gestational calendars use the beginning of a woman’s last cycle as a start date, but conception usually occurs two weeks later, meaning that at this point, the embryo has...
__label__3 Texas abortion providers ask supreme court to halt unprecedented abortion lawTexas abortion providers are asking the US supreme court to block a near-total abortion ban that allows any individual the right to sue an abortion provider who violates the extreme law, a final effort to stop the unprecedented measure from taking effect on Wednesday. Signed into law by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in May, Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically around six weeks – and offers no exceptions for rape or incest. The appeal to the nation’s high court comes after the largely conservative fifth circuit...
__label__1 Biden's $3.5 Trillion Spending Plan Will Leave Americans Poorer in the Long RunOPINIONAs Congress wrangles over the details of a massive spending bill that's central to President Joe Biden's "Build Back Better" plan, a new analysis shows the proposal will leave America poorer in the long run. Biden's plan to hike federal spending by about $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years—paid for with a combination of huge tax increases and up to $1.75 trillion in new borrowing—will decrease future economic growth and reduce private wealth, according to a new analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), a macroeconomic forecasting project based at the...
__label__4 Tripwire boss steps down over support for Texas abortion lawThe president of game-studio Tripwire Interactive has stepped down after tweeting support for a controversial new abortion law in Texas. The Texas law bans abortions from as early as six weeks into pregnancy. John Gibson tweeted he was "proud" of the legal outcome and was a "a pro-life game developer". Some of the studio's partners rapidly distanced themselves from Mr Gibson, with one announcing it would cancel its contracts over the issue. And two days after the tweet was posted, amid an avalanche of criticism, Tripwire said: "Effective immediately, John Gibson...
__label__3 Roe v. Wade Is Now in the Hands of the Three Trump JusticesANALYSISOne of the most interesting fissures that has opened up within the conservative legal movement in recent years has been between mainstream conservative lawyers and the growing performance artist faction of the lawyers for the Trump base. Soon, the conservative justices themselves will have to pick which side of the battle they are on: With the filing last week of a brief that explicitly asks the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the state of Mississippi is forcing the court’s three newest Trump-appointed justices to choose between institutional stability and...
__label__2 Infrastructure Bill May Violate Biden 'Red Line' With 'Per-Mile User Fee'Despite President Joe Biden's supposed "red line" on raising taxes for those making less than $400,000, the draft infrastructure bill in the Senate includes a "national motor vehicle per-mile user fee pilot" program. If that remained in the bill, it would take future legislation in order for Biden to keep his promise not to raise taxes on lower-income Americans, the Washington Examiner reported. White House officials had been adamant Biden will not support a gas tax or user fees like the mileage pilot program, but section 13002 of the 2,702-page initial...
__label__4 U.S. Justice Dept. says will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attackThe U.S. Justice Department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law that imposed a near-total ban on abortion. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or "aids or abets" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a...
__label__3 72 killed as South Africa grapples with its worst political violence since apartheidSouth Africa is grappling with the worst political violence the country has seen since the end of the racist apartheid regime. The death toll after five days of violent riots and looting, sparked by the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma, hit at least 72 on Wednesday. Some of the most violent unrest has been in Alexandra township, a suburb of Johannesburg, where CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said hordes of looters have spent days ransacking retail stores, grabbing anything they can get their hands on. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, the police have...
__label__1 Trump moves to block effort to get his tax returns after DOJ gave green lightLawyers for former President Donald Trump moved to block House Democratic efforts to obtain his tax returns, blasting the push as a political attempt to harm him following the Justice Department greenlighting the effort. Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts had requested six years of Trump's tax returns and those of eight Trump-associated businesses in April 2019. Then-Treasury Secretary Mnuchin rejected the effort in May 2019, and was backed up by the Trump DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel in June 2019. But the Biden DOJ concluded in...
__label__5 Lyft And Uber Offer To Pay Legal Fees For Drivers Sued Under Texas Abortion LawRideshare companies Lyft and Uber both separately announced they will cover legal fees for any drivers who are sued under Texas’ new abortion law for transporting women to abortion clinics, following a wave of other companies that have declared they would provide aid to women seeking abortions in the state. Under Texas’ new abortion law, anyone who helps an individual with an abortion, including driving them to a clinic, can be sued and fined over $10,000, which raised concerns for some rideshare drivers, according to NPR. Lyft said it has created a “Driver Defense Fund” to cover 100%...

__label__1 Democrats target rich people’s retirement accounts to pay for progressive wish-list items in $3.5T spending billANALYSISThe lawmakers are reportedly 'aghast' that some have millions while others have next to nothing in retirement savings. Democrats on Capitol Hill are reportedly setting their sights on wealthy people's "super-sized retirement savings accounts" as one way to pay for a litany of progressive wish-list items included in their mammoth $3.5 trillion spending plan. Politico reported Tuesday that congressional Democrats are "aghast" that some people have managed their wealth responsibly and amassed multimillion-dollar individual retirement accounts while others have next to nothing — an unacceptable imbalance in the democratic-socialist state the...
__label__4 Abortion ruling and the Supreme Court’s shadow docketA major abortion decision with no oral arguments, lower court rulings, or even a justice’s signature: That’s what happened Wednesday night. In a break with tradition, the Supreme Court is regularly using its shadow docket for cases with potentially far-reaching implications. It sounds dramatic. It sounds nefarious. But the United States Supreme Court’s “shadow docket” is not new. What is new, however, is how the court has been using it. In the space of 10 days, the justices have put the shadow docket – every decision the court makes not...
__label__3 US Brags About Health Aid to Africa While Bombing Some of its Most Vulnerable NationsAS COVID-19 BEGAN spreading across the African continent in late March, the U.S. State Department took to Twitter to boast about American health assistance there. A March 25 tweet from the department highlighted more than $100 million in U.S. medical assistance to foreign countries, including in Africa, as evidence of America’s emphasis on mitigating “endemic and emerging health threats” and its “long-term investment in the lives of Africans.” When it comes to Africa, the messaging suggests, America’s focus is on saving lives, not ending them. But a wealth of evidence...
__label__1 Taxes Separate Dying Illinois From Thriving MissouriANALYSISOn the I-57 highway through Illinois, time seems to go backward with each southbound mile. The houses and cars in the yards get older. As years pass, town populations shrink. Eventually, homes turn back into piles of disconnected wood and glass, then empty lots. At the end of the highway, the town of Cairo slowly sinks back into the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. A town of 15,000 people in the 1920s, Cairo now houses fewer than 2,000 residents. Today, the town is so silent that the few voices heard while...
__label__5 The Supreme Court Heads Toward Reversing Abortion RightsThe Supreme Court's conservative majority tossed a legal bomb into the abortion debate late Wednesday night. By a vote of 5-to-4, the court's most conservative members upheld, for now, a Texas law that, in effect, bans abortions after about six weeks. But almost as important as the result was how the court reached its decision — without full briefing and arguments before any court. The court majority, including its three Trump appointees, emphasized that it was not ruling on the issues presented in the case. Still, it refused to block the law...
__label__3 With a distracted public, the Pentagon tries to get away with killing innocent civiliansTHE UNITED STATES’S WARS continue to rage in the Middle East and Africa against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even in normal times, these conflicts got little public scrutiny. But with attention more occupied than usual, some U.S. military operations have been escalating even further. In recent years, these conflicts have become even deadlier for innocent people. The Trump administration has shown itself to be not just indifferent, but positively encouraging of the killing of civilians in foreign wars. If there is a time to get away with killing...
__label__2 Biden’s ‘Double Death Tax’OPINIONFor more than a generation, Republicans have rallied to the flag of “kill the death tax,” and for good reason: Poll after poll shows it to be the tax that ordinary Americans find the most unfair. Democrats, understanding this, have cooperated (however reluctantly) in reducing the tax (its rate has fallen from 55 percent to 40 percent this century) and expanding the exemption to it (now as high as $25 million for a married couple). And on the state level, death taxes have all but disappeared from tax codes. Yet now, the “norms restoring” Biden administration is attempting to double...
__label__4 Supreme Court Upholds New Texas Abortion Law, For NowThe U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday night refused to block a Texas law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The vote was 5-to-4, with three Trump-appointed justices joining two other conservative justices. Dissenting were conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, and the court's three liberal justices. The decision left open the option for abortion providers to challenge the Texas law in other ways in the future, leaving open the possibility--even likelihood-- that the case will return to the Supreme Court, though not for months or longer. The opinion was unsigned. It said...

But the Biden administration has increased pressure on some of them to take the vaccine—willing or unwilling. All through the pandemic, truckers endured hardships to keep America’s infrastructure running. They waited in line for hours in sight of bathrooms they weren’t allowed to use. On the road, some died alone of COVID-19. Now, with supply chains disrupted, Americans need them more than ever. But faced with the prospect of mandated vaccination, many drivers are considering quitting. “I’d fight it,” said veteran trucker Mike Widdins,...

President Biden’s aides announced the commitments after mounting international shipping delays. As of this week, nearly 100 massive container ships idled off the Los Angeles coastline, unable to unload their goods.

Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) introduced a bill Wednesday aimed at reducing Chinese control over technology used by the Department of Defense and its contractors. The bill would require defense contractors to disclose where they obtained printed circuit boards, which are an essential component of most complex technology. "A disproportionate amount of the printed circuit boards used in the Department of Defense's electronic systems come from China, where they are vulnerable to sabotage by the Chinese government," Hawley's office said. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern...
__label__5 'Leave no Tigrayan': In Ethiopia, an ethnicity is erasedThe atrocities have been seared into the skin and the minds of Tigrayans, who take shelter by the thousands within sight of the homeland they fled in northern Ethiopia. They arrive in heat that soars above 38 C (100 F), carrying the pain of gunshot wounds, torn vaginas, welts on beaten backs. Less visible are the horrors that jolt them awake at night: Memories of dozens of bodies strewn on riverbanks. Fighters raping a woman one by one for speaking her own language. A child, weakened by hunger, left behind....

A two-year transition government administered by the military would take over, the constitution would be suspended, and a three-month state of emergency would be put in place, he added. Sudan’s state media also reported that all political prisoners, including leaders of the protests that precipitated Bashir’s fall, were in the process of being released from jails around the country. The announcement by Awad Ibn...
__label__2 Biden Administration Silent After Ford Ditches Ohio For MexicoANALYSISFord announced it is moving a nearly $1 billion project from Ohio to Mexico, prompting criticism from a major labor union and silence from the Biden administration, which has pledged to invest in domestic union projects. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said he will be the most pro-union president in history by investing significant amounts of money in domestic infrastructure spending. The previous administration spoke out loudly against outsourcing in the automotive industry. In 2017, Ford canceled a multibillion-dollar investment project in Mexico and invested $1.2 billion in three Michigan...
__label__4 Why Ghana Does Disputed Elections Better Than the United StatesANALYSISMaintaining democracy requires solid institutions like competent election management bodies and an independent judiciary. But it also takes sustained political leadership and society’s commitment to respect and abide by established norms. The danger of ignoring these norms can be fatal.

The National Guard was activated in an attempt to bring order to the chaos that has resulted in the aftermath of an otherwise peaceful and properly conducted election....

__label__2 Instead of Lifting Trump's Tariffs, Biden Is Imposing More of ThemANALYSISPresident Joe Biden's first major trade policy move will be disappointing for anyone who hoped his inauguration would put an end to the presidential practice of unilaterally imposing expensive, unnecessary tariffs for vacuous national security reasons. Biden's decision last week to reimpose 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) contains all the major hallmarks of former President Donald Trump's misguided trade policies. Biden even sounded downright Trumpian as he announced the renewed tariffs—which Trump had lifted during his final days in office. "The available evidence...

__label__2 Africa’s Economy Is Rising. Now What Happens to Its Food?For decades, the economies of Africa were the world’s economic laggards. They aren’t anymore. Over the last decade, Africa’s per capita income has grown at a rate nearly identical to that of the rest of the world. It’s reasonable to imagine that the continent is in the early stages of a trajectory that could mimic that of Latin America or, more ambitiously, parts of Asia. With the world experiencing one of the greatest extended reductions in poverty on record, Africa has finally become part of the story. A middle class...
__label__1 Future of US-China Trade Deal Uncertain as Beijing Fails to Meet Phase One TargetsWASHINGTON—China has fallen short on meeting its pledges in the “phase one” trade agreement signed last year and the Biden administration will soon commence a review of the deal to determine a proper policy response. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen said there would be no immediate moves to lift punitive tariffs on Chinese imports that were imposed by the Trump administration. “We are closely monitoring China’s adherence to all of its Phase One commitments, including both the purchase commitments and structural commitments,” she said on Jan. 21, in a written...

Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere.  In March and April, however, the worst impacts of the pandemic were...

Negotiations among the governments of Niger, Mali and France led to freedom for Serge Lazarevic, 51, who was described by the French president as in "relatively good health" despite his long captivity.

Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and other Democratic lawmakers were draped in scarves made from a cloth of colourful geometric Ghanaian designs called kente. It turned out to be quite a controversial sartorial choice. Why were they wearing it? The...

In an interview to discuss his tenure as Trump’s top diplomat, Pompeo told the Washington Examiner that the United States is in a stronger position to counter China than four years ago because of key foreign policy decisions made by the outgoing president. Pompeo said Trump’s innovative strategy started with Washington’s crackdown...

But a case before the U.S. Supreme Court highlights what can happen when politics flip-flop so wildly and quickly.

The headline from Justice Breyer’s majority opinion four years ago, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, was that the 5-to-4 decision found a Texas law unconstitutional in...

__label__1 Assessing Trump's Experiment With Protectionist Trade PoliciesANALYSISWith President Donald Trump soon departing Washington, now is a great time to assess his protectionist trade policies. From tariffs to his hectic bullying of other governments to renegotiate trade agreements to his support for American export subsidies, the Trump years were more than infuriating on trade matters; they were destructive. This harsh conclusion is no surprise to those of us who understand international trade. We realized from the start that the president's trade philosophy is the mercantilist one that Adam Smith debunked nearly 250 years ago. For instance, Trump...

Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...

After the bill’s passage — a major victory for the Republicans — the text will now go to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s (R) desk to be signed into law. Abbott, in trying to pass the bill, had called...
__label__4 Trump To Withdraw Polarizing Nominee To Lead Bureau Of Land ManagementAmid pressure from Democrats and some Republicans, the Trump administration is planning to withdraw its controversial nominee to head the federal Bureau of Land Management. The sprawling public lands agency, which manages roughly a tenth of the landmass of the United States, has not had a permanent, Senate-confirmed director for the entire Trump era. The nominee, William Perry Pendley, has been leading the agency since last August through a series of controversial continued appointment extensions. Prior to coming to Washington D.C., the Wyoming native had spent much of his career...
__label__3 White People Own 98 Percent of Rural Land. Young Black Farmers Want to Reclaim Their Share.Black people have largely been expelled from the US agricultural landscape. In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners. Today, only about 49,000 of them remain, making up just 1.4 percent of the nation’s farm owners, and tending a scant 4.7 million acres—a nearly 90 percent loss. This didn’t happen by accident. Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land...

Now, let’s talk about the mess in which we find our election system. Let’s talk about voter fraud. It does exist; claims to the contrary are incorrect. And discussions about voting integrity matter because we have about one year to decide how to avoid the confusion and controversy surrounding the 2020 election. “Flagrant” election fraud has been “documented throughout this nation’s history,” according to the U.S. Supreme Court. And so it goes today....

As combines work their way north from the Southern Plains of Texas and Oklahoma, farmers and harvesting companies are having a hard time finding and keeping workers. Any delays in the harvest could send wheat prices higher and cause a scramble to secure supplies to make bread and pasta. The United...

__label__1 If Kavanaugh And Barrett Betray Pro-Lifers, We Must Blow Up The Conservative Legal MovementOPINIONIf we don't have justices who are comfortable overturning outrageously unconstitutional abortion rulings, it will be proof of the conservative legal movement's utter failure. Less than a handful of years after their hard-won elevation to the Supreme Court, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are sending a chill down the spines of conservatives with a string of bad signals from their seats on the court. In July, Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the court’s leftist majority in declining to hear Arlene’s Flowers v. Washington, a critical religious liberty case. They again sided with...
__label__5 Examining Biden’s Farm Bankruptcy ClaimFACT CHECKJoe Biden claimed that farm bankruptcies increased last year “due largely to Trump’s unmitigated disaster of a tariff war.” International trade was a factor, but there were additional reasons that predate the trade war — such as years of relatively weak prices, declining incomes and rising farm debt, according to agricultural economists and government reports. “The bankruptcy wave this year has roots that go back several years,” Chad E. Hart, an associate professor of economics and crop markets specialist at Iowa State University, told us in an email. The former...
__label__3 COVID-19 Shows Why We Must Socialize the Food SystemOPINIONThe COVID-19 crisis is revealing a basic contradiction at the heart of capitalism. On the one hand, we have learned that this virus is itself a product of our capitalist agricultural system. As Rob Wallace and coauthors argue, the conditions for virus transmission are rooted in our propensity to clear-cut dense, wild forests — often the reservoirs of viruses themselves — and replace them with homogenous plantation ecologies like palm oil or livestock operations with one species of animal crowded together.As they put it:

Kennedy promised Americans that he would never let the pope influence him on “matters of public policy.” How times have changed. Today’s Democrats boast of their political alliance with Pope Francis. They openly confer with him on matters of public policy, as evident in Joe Biden’s latest visit to the Vatican. After he met with the pope last Friday, Biden praised him for “fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic...

__label__4 President Trump's Executive Order on Meat ProcessingThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn April 28th, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at restoring the meat supply chain by classifying meat products under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and providing liability protection to meat processing plants that abide by CDC and OSHA guidelines. Trump noted that he had consulted with Tyson Foods before the order was written.Despite the headlines, the executive order itself does not actually order meat processing plants to do anything; rather, it incentivizes plants to reopen and gives Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue the authority to reopen plants "to promote the national defense."American meat production has fallen dramatically due to the pandemic, with meat industry companies considering keeping just 20% of plants open. Beef and pork production are already down 35% from this time last year, and chicken production is down 7% (WSJ). Since the executive order, seven more plants have shut down.As of May 6th, over 10,000 coronavirus cases have been linked to meat processing plants. At least 45 workers have died so far.

Dairy farmers, faced with shuttered schools and dwindling demand for milk amid the pandemic, applied in droves for the Trump administration’s $350 billion small-businesses aid program, until Thursday when money for the program ran out. “The COVID-19 situation has significantly disrupted the supply side of the dairy economy,” said Paul Kohls, chief lending operations officer at Compeer Financial, one of the nation’s 72 Farm Credit lenders. “It’s very challenging,” Kohls told MarketWatch on Thursday. “Either dairy farmers are dumping milk or the processors are dumping milk,...

A South Dakota pork processing plant ordered to shut down after 400 employees tested positive for coronavirus.

The Department of Justice on Tuesday night filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for Western Texas. In the 49-page complaint, the DOJ said Texas’ ban on abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which typically occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy, unlawfully curtails women’s reproductive rights. The law bans most pre-viability abortions, including in instances of rape or incest,...
__label__5 Opinion: You call this a trade deal?OPINIONOK, let’s assume that something deserving the name “U.S.-China trade deal” has been reached — even one dubbed “Phase One” or “preliminary.” Deep doubts would remain justified about whether it can possibly serve American interests. For example, where’s even an English-language version? There’s nothing new about such agreements coming out in both English and Chinese, raising thorny questions about ensuring that key terms in both languages are commonly understood — on top of all the towering issues raised by China’s long record of flouting official commitments it’s made.

Alternatively, a film can meet the requirement by casting 30% of secondary roles from two underrepresented groups (women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, or people with disabilities), or by highlighting underrepresented groups through a main storyline.This is one of a series of initiatives implemented by the Academy and movie studios in response to the 2015 #OscarsSoWhite backlash.The new diversity standards will go into effect starting with the 2024 Academy Awards.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from Positive Reactions  to Negative ReactionsThe Oscars’ New Diversity Rules Are Sweeping but SafeThe Oscars' new diversity rules are all well and good, but will they make any difference?

__label__2 The Black Photographers Who Paved The Way For The World We Live In NowANALYSISOver the last century, as photography as a medium grew in popularity and decreased in price, people from every walk of life picked up cameras to document their surroundings. For many Black photographers who spent years or decades documenting the day-to-day lives of their communities, these records care more weight than ever due to a history of racism and neglect from larger, mostly white archival institutions like museums and libraries. "[I] can only guess that the lack of diversity in curatorial positions is a contributing factor to these photographers not...

In the midst of one of the worst droughts in the state’s history, state and federal wildlife officials were depleting a large reservoir in the Sierra foothills to save (by increasing river flows) a handful of hatchery-born fish that had virtually zero chance of making it to the Pacific Ocean alive. At a water-board meeting I attended, local farmers and residents were incredulous at officials’ refusal to prioritize humans over critters. This week’s news gives that story a...

__label__3 Hong Kong Is China, Like It or NotOPINIONNo amount of outcry, condemnation or sanctions over the Chinese government’s purported encroachment in Hong Kong’s affairs will alter the fact that Hong Kong is part of China and that its destiny is intertwined with the mainland’s. Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of crises after the eruption of protests last year over a proposed bill (long since withdrawn) that would have allowed the extradition of some suspects in criminal cases to mainland China. Hong Kongers who wanted the city promptly to return to peace thought the authorities’...

What is the process by which one trades off climate against human rights?” “Well, life is always full of tough choices in...

Our thought bubble, via Axios China reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian: No one should underestimate China’s intelligence services.

__label__3 Major brands try to determine if cotton in their clothes is from Uighur forced labor in ChinaOn Tuesday the House overwhelmingly passed a bill that would block the import of all cotton from Xinjiang, China, processed by forced labor, the latest in a series of U.S. moves to counter the Chinese government's persecution of Xinjiang's Muslim Uighur minority. "It is time for Congress to act," said bill sponsor Rep. Jim McGovern, D.-Mass., during floor debate on the bill, which passed 406 to 3 and now heads to the Senate. "We found that the evidence of systematic and widespread forced labor in Xinjiang is astounding and irrefutable...
__label__1 Harris Assails China’s Bid to ‘Coerce,’ ‘Intimidate’ South China Sea NeighborsIn Singapore on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris scolded China for trying to bully its neighbors in the South China Sea region.  The vice president said that China “continues to coerce, to intimidate, and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea.” “Beijing’s actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations. The United States stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats,” she added. The rebuke comes as China has used the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as a propaganda point,...
__label__4 Americans Fault China for Its Role in the Spread of COVID-19Americans’ views of China have continued to sour, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Today, 73% of U.S. adults say they have an unfavorable view of the country, up 26 percentage points since 2018. Since March alone, negative views of China have increased 7 points, and there is a widespread sense that China mishandled the initial outbreak and subsequent spread of COVID-19. Around two-thirds of Americans (64%) say China has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Around three-quarters (78%) place a great deal or fair...

The pardon came five years after Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton admitted to choking Jennifer Laude in a hotel room after paying her for sex and finding out she was transgender. Pemberton had served less than six years of a 10-year sentence for the killing. The decision to release and pardon him was confirmed on Twitter by the foreign secretary of the Philippines, Teddy Locsin Jr. But Duterte's decision...
__label__2 Kamala Harris heads to Vietnam and Singapore after staying quiet amid Afghanistan chaosAs large crowds swarm Afghanistan’s Kabul airport to flee the Taliban takeover of the country, Vice President Kamala Harris is embarking Friday on a trip to Asia with stops in Singapore and Vietnam — ironically, the sites of previous US-UK military humiliations. But Harris’ office has argued that the trip — planned before last weekend’s Taliban seizure of Kabul — shouldn’t be “bogged down” by comparing Afghanistan to past calamities including the US defeat by Vietnam’s Communist government in the 1970s. “We don’t want to get bogged down in the...

Parallel rallies in Gujarat and Texas—Howdy Modi and Namaste Trump—were held on Sept. 22, 2019, and Feb. 24 and 25 this year. Each rally drew thousands of attendees in person and many more on online streams. Pundits have frequently noted the similarities between Trump and Modi, and the closeness of their relationship.

__label__2 Report: China Was Only Major Economic Power to Increase Pollution in 2020Bloomberg Opinion columnist David Fickling noted Wednesday that while China makes all sorts of grandiose promises about reaching “net zero” carbon emissions by 2060, it was the only major economic power in the world that increased pollution in 2020. That analysis came from a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Tuesday, which found energy demand and “global energy-related CO2 emissions” went down across the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, “the largest annual percentage decline since World War II.” “Demand for fossil fuels was hardest hit in 2020...

__label__2 Nets Skip Outrage at Disney for Thanking China Concentration Camp BossesANALYSISWhile the broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) were stoking fear of any coronavirus vaccine produced under Trump’s presidency, they blacked out the nationwide outrage at ABC-owner Disney for giving a “special thanks” to the operators of China’s Uighur concentration camps in the credits of their new movie Mulan. It was a missed opportunity for their competitors at CBS and NBC. The Libertarian magazine Reason put it best in describing the disturbing situation with Disney’s praise for the murderous Chinese regime. “The new Mulan movie is facing a barrage of...
__label__4 Why India and Russia Are Going to Stay FriendsOPINIONIn December 1971, India and Pakistan fought for 13 days—one of the shortest wars in history—over the humanitarian crisis in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. India had, for months, been trying to convince the world that West Pakistan’s subjugation of East Pakistan was an emergency. Refugees from East Pakistan were pouring into India, and the situation would only be improved with a resolution of the political predicament between West and East Pakistan. The Soviet Union was the only country that listened. In August of that year, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi...

But Pentagon officials and private analysts say the openness about military cooperation between the former...
__label__5 New Reports of Russian Bounties on U.S. & Allied ForcesThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn Friday, The New York Times reported that American intelligence officials had concluded that Russian intelligence agency G.R.U. was offering bounties to Taliban fighters for killing U.S. and allied forces while U.S.-Taliban peace talks were underway. On Monday, the Associated Press reported that the White House was aware of the bounties as early as 2019.While the Times reported that the issue was briefed to President Trump and discussed by the National Security Council, President Trump disputed the claims, tweeting: "Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or [Vice President Pence]." White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany backed up the President's defense on Monday.Lawmakers from both major parties called for answers, prompting the White House to hold two separate briefings for select groups of congressmen: Republicans on Monday, Democrats on Tuesday morning. Republican lawmakers confirmed the intelligence but said they needed further information before approving retaliatory action.If American soldiers are confirmed to have died as a result of Russian bounties, it would significantly escalate tensions with Russia, which has provided intelligence, weapons, and financial support to the Taliban since 2013 (IFRI). However, while four American soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in early 2020, the Taliban has not attacked American positions since February (New York Times).CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from Left-Leaning Reactions to Right-Leaning ReactionsRussian bounties to Taliban story may be putting US lives at risk — here's howThe report of Russia putting bounties on U.S. soldiers is disturbing.

__label__2 Why the Fed’s only Democrat could unseat the current chairANALYSISNearing a decision on who should lead the Federal Reserve, President Biden brought two contenders into the White House last week: the current chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Fed governor Lael Brainard. White House officials have stayed in touch with Brainard since her meeting with Biden, and the administration emphasizes that no final decision has been made. But the conversations underscore how the White House could be looking to make a change by picking Brainard for one of the world’s most powerful policymaking roles, despite Powell’s popularity and his record steering the economy out of the...
__label__2 Theme Parks Ban Yelling On Roller Coasters: ‘Please Scream Inside Your Heart’Japan’s theme parks banned screaming when they reopened after the coronavirus pandemic.A recent video showed Fuji-Q Highland amusement park CEO Daisuke Iwata and his boss, chief executive Koichiro Horiuchi, riding the popular Fujiyama roller coaster in silence while wearing masks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

__label__5 Can the developing world endure the coronavirus?When the coronavirus first began spreading from China to the rest of the world, public health experts issued dire warnings about the toll the virus would take on poor countries. The United Nations predicted in early April that as many as 3.3 million people in Africa may die from COVID-19. Philanthropist Melinda Gates warned of “bodies out on the street” on the continent. Similarly dire forecasts were made about developing nations in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere.  In March and April, however, the worst impacts of the pandemic were...

__label__3 Deficit shrinks in the first year of Joe Biden's presidencyANALYSISWhen it comes to the deficit, Americans have endured a remarkably consistent pattern for four decades. It starts with a Republican presidential candidate denouncing the deficit and vowing to balance the budget if elected. That Republican then takes office, abandons interest in the issue, and expresses indifference when the deficit becomes vastly larger. Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize. During the Democratic administration, the...

According to International Christian Concern (ICC), eight separate attacks have taken place in two weeks involving radical Hindu nationalist groups that are physically assaulting Christians and damaging their property. The most recent incident occurred on June 21 where a pastor was praying for a sick person in Kolonguda village.

__label__5 Bangladesh Arrests Teenage Child for Criticizing Prime MinisterBangladesh authorities on Saturday arrested a 15-year-old for “defaming” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed in a Facebook post. It was an especially egregious move in a wave of arbitrary arrests targeting critics of the ruling party with the harsh and vaguely worded Digital Security Act (DSA). Police in Bhaluka, north of Dhaka, told the media that they arrested the child after a local ruling party politician said the boy had “badmouthed … our mother-like leader.” The child was sent to a juvenile detention center where, police said, he would spend...

__label__1 Dems Abandon Billionaire Tax That Faced Constitutional HurdlesAn aborted Democratic plan to tax assets held by billionaires was vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds, experts told the Washington Free Beacon. The Constitution authorizes three forms of taxation, and tax-law gurus interviewed by the Free Beacon said the ill-fated billionaire's tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories. The measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year—like a stock or a closely held company—which aren't currently taxed until they're sold. Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) on Wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire's tax...
__label__4 If Biden picks Brainard over Powell for Fed chief, expect an immediate market impactANALYSISIf Lael Brainard is named Federal Reserve chairman, the first move by financial markets may be to price in an even more dovish central bank. That means the Fed would be expected to take longer to raise interest rates or tighten policy than under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Currently, traders are expecting the Fed to begin raising rates in the second half of next year, once it winds down its bond buying program. Until just recently, Powell was expected to be renominated to the chairmanship, but President Joe Biden has now interviewed both Powell and...

But it's not Biden officials or Democrats who are pushing the topic most aggressively on Twitter and other platforms. It's Republicans and right-wing media outlets attacking the proposal as a violation of privacy and arguing that the IRS would...

Progressive Democrats applauded that announcement, seeing in her a person who would bring a tougher approach to banks at an agency that has been criticized for being too friendly with...
__label__3 Everything Is Getting More ExpensiveConsumer prices rose more than economists expected last month, new numbers show, on top of an already high August reading. While a jump in prices was expected as the economy recovered from the pandemic shock, persistently high inflation is complicating plans for both the Fed and the White House, who face pressure to act so that price gains don’t become a permanent fixture. Americans are paying more for dinner, fuel and housing, and wage gains, while decent, aren’t keeping up. Hopes that a spike in prices would quickly fade — that pandemic-induced...
__label__2 Single-Family Home Prices Soar by 23 Percent In Q2 Over Year Ago, Sharpest Rise on RecordA shortage of housing stock combined with robust homebuyer demand and low mortgage rates sent U.S. home prices soaring by the highest annual rate on record in the second quarter, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The median price of an existing single-family home surged by 22.9 percent in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the year-ago period, hitting an all-time high of $357,900, the NAR said in an Aug. 12 report.

Revenues jumped 18 percent in the fiscal year that just ended, analysts say — the biggest one-year increase since 1977. That translates into $627 billion more than in 2020, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that, for the first time, total government revenues topped $4 trillion. “They are just booming,” said Mark Booth, a former top revenue forecaster at the agency. “It is very unusual.” Though Democrats are hammering the rich...

__label__4 Should Democrats have embraced the billionaire tax?As congressional Democrats ironed out the details of their ambitious social spending and infrastructure package, the lawmakers considered a novel proposal for paying for it: a billionaire tax. But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans. Under current law, assets like stocks are subject to...

There is no way for the public to know who uses these special trusts aside from when they’ve been disclosed in lawsuits or securities filings.

The so-called core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy and is the Fed’s preferred method for gauging inflation, rose 3.4 percent in the 12 months to May, after rising 3.1 percent in the year to April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The last time the core PCE inflation gauge saw a similar year-over-year vault was in April...
__label__5 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...
__label__3 Two Fed officials announce retirements amid controversy over ethics and stocktradingTwo top Fed officials are leaving their posts amid scrutiny over their stocktrading activities during the covid crisis, behavior which spurred an unusual review by the Federal Reserve of trading rules for its officials. Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan both announced their retirements on Monday. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News and other outlets reported on the financial disclosures of the regional bank presidents, showing that both actively traded in stocks and other investments while in their roles setting monetary policy and...

The group of developed nations agreed to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. This marks a huge shift for smaller economies, such as the Republic of Ireland, which have attracted international firms — to a large extent — via a lower tax rate. “The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of...
__label__3 The Government Gave Free PPP Money to Public Companies Despite Warning Them Not to ApplyAs Congress launched a historic bailout to keep businesses afloat at the outset of the pandemic, government officials stressed that the loans were for mom-and-pop operations that didn’t have another easily available lifeline. “This was a program designed for small businesses,” then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, as companies like Shake Shack and Potbelly made headlines for grabbing millions from the newly created Paycheck Protection Program. “It was not a program that was designed for public companies that had liquidity.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was even clearer. “We will go after...
__label__2 ‘Defund the police’ unpopular in Senate, spending to hire cops wins huge bipartisan supportSen. Josh Hawley’s proposal to hire 100,000 police officers across the country has received rare bipartisan support in the Senate. The Missouri Republican’s amendment passed by a 95-3 vote Wednesday, signaling a willingness from both parties to expand policing. The measure would send grants to local municipalities to hire more law enforcement officers as the country faces a rise in violent crime and a rash of officers quitting the force. “As you have recognized, putting 100,000 more officers on the beat is vitally important for public safety,” Mr. Hawley wrote...
__label__4 Documents show Trump lost millions operating D.C. hotelThe Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a hangout for Republican allies of former President Donald Trump during his term at the White House, was a big money loser for Trump's company, according to a cache of documents released by congressional Democrats on Friday. How big? The company incurred $70 million in net losses, according to the House Oversight Committee. The panel said Trump claimed the hotel, on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House, generated $150 million in revenue during his time in office. But it said...
__label__3 Trump shattered tradition on Fed chair. Some Dems want Biden to do the same.ANALYSISLeft-leaning activists and lawmakers are pushing President Joe Biden to dump Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for Fed Governor Lael Brainard with a last-ditch message: Don’t miss a rare opportunity to install a known and tested Democrat atop the world’s most important economic institution. It’s a conundrum for Biden. He can stick with Powell, a choice that would please markets — renominating someone from the opposite party as Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did — or put his own stamp on the Fed for years as President...
__label__2 How To Be An Anti-ExtremistOPINIONOne either allows wrongthink to persevere, as an extremist, or confronts wrongthink, as an anti-extremist. There is no in-between safe space of “not extremist.” The claim of “not extremist” neutrality is a mask for extremism. That’s a very slight paraphrase of a line from Ibram X. Kendi’s How to be an Antiracist. In Kendi’s telling—his version is about racists and antiracists and racial inequities—it’s the air-tight justification for an “anti-racist constitutional amendment” and a consequent “Department of Antiracism” (I wonder who should be in charge of that?). It is also the...
__label__4 Debt Limit Q&AFACT CHECKDemocrats and Republicans are once again in a standoff over a looming debt limit crisis. Congress must raise or suspend the limit on federal borrowing soon or the U.S. government won’t be able to pay its bills. Here we provide the facts on the political dispute. What is the debt limit? The debt limit is a cap on how much the Treasury Department can borrow to fund federal operations. Congress sets the debt limit, as required by federal law and consistent with the Constitution, which gives Congress the “power of the purse.” The limit,...
__label__3 Clash among progressives is boosting the Fed chief’s path to keeping his jobFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s record as head of the U.S. central bank is sparking a rift among progressives — and that may clear a path for him to keep his job. The Republican Fed chief has inspired blistering disapproval from lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and others who have accused him of ignoring climate change and going too easy on banks. Other critics say he has stoked income inequality by pumping trillions of dollars into Wall Street and done little to bring diversity to the Fed’s ranks. Some...
__label__2 Olympics Remind Us That Sports Build Bridges Where Governments Can'tANALYSISThe United States and Iran met today at the Tokyo Olympics to play basketball. The elephant in the room—decades of geopolitical saber-rattling and proxy violence—was nowhere to be seen. The Americans clapped as the Iranian national anthem played. The Iranians applauded "The Star-Spangled Banner." Handshakes and niceties were exchanged before and after the game. It was a match between opponents, not enemies. Historical relations between the U.S. and Iran might make that goodwill seem staggering—but today's game perfectly highlights the difference in how governments interact and how normal people do. The story...

But even though Montenegro said he has never been in a car accident, nor been issued a ticket for a moving violation, he has never in his adult life qualified for affordable car insurance. That's something that Montenegro, 30, who earns a "good living" as a public relations staffer in Washington, D.C., says is inextricably tied to his poor credit score, which is in the low 500s. He most recently received multiple monthly premium quotes of around $350 for minimal coverage for one...

Here’s how they do itThe wealthiest Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in income taxes every year, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and many leverage tax laws to do it legally, financial experts say. Although U.S. levies increase with income, the ultra-wealthy often finesse the tax code to reduce how much they owe. And some billionaires, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, pay little to no taxes compared to their wealth, a ProPublica report found.  “As long as you’re adhering to the law, everything’s fair game,” said certified...

A California real estate broker raked in more than $500,000 within half a year. A Nigerian government official is accused of pocketing over $350,000 in less than six weeks.  What they all had in common, according to federal prosecutors, was participation in what may turn out to be the biggest fraud wave in U.S. history: filing bogus claims for unemployment insurance benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. (The broker has pleaded guilty, while the Bronx man and Nigerian official have pleaded...

__label__1 Urban Policy Can Help Bridge Political DividesOPINIONUrbanists lament the fact that the average American knows and cares little about the built environment, but this sad reality has a significant upside. Because urban policy is a relatively fringe topic, it presents what is in today’s political climate a rare opportunity: the chance to make converts to conservative principles through rational persuasion. As the left and right solidify into ever more intransigent blocs, thoughtful dialogue has been relegated to internal discussions, while cross-faction exchanges have little hope of changing minds. There are myriad explanations for the trend, but...

Trump told a crowd in Sarasota, Florida, on Saturday night that "every company" does "fringe benefits," but he mocked prosecutors for pursuing the charges, saying it is "reminiscent of a communist dictatorship targeting your political opponents." The comments mark the former President's most substantial yet on the charges after they were unsealed last week in...

After working as an oil industry engineer out west, he returned home in the 1990s and found the piles—known as “gob,” for “garbage of bituminous”—still pockmarking the landscape. The present worry is that these unlined pits are leaching deadly carcinogens into the groundwater—or, worse, that they will catch fire and start polluting the air, too. (Of the 772 gob piles...
__label__3 Fact-checking Biden’s claim that raising debt limit is usually bipartisanFACT CHECKFacing the prospect of the federal government running out of money to pay its bills in weeks, President Joe Biden said Senate Republicans are "reckless" and "hypocritical" by refusing to join Democrats in voting to raise the debt limit. "Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking, and it should be," Biden said Oct. 4.  Biden pointed the finger at Republicans, saying that they incurred debt during the Trump administration, and the Democrats helped them out at the time.

Congressional Democrats are united behind sweeping voting rights legislation that won’t pass the Senate so long as the filibuster exists, because Republicans are united against it. Republican legislators in Texas, Georgia, Florida and elsewhere have passed numerous voting restrictions over united Democratic opposition. But on one sliver of voting issues, it seems lawmakers might — might! — be able to agree. The Native American Voting Rights Act, or NAVRA, was introduced in the House last month...

Chairman Jerome Powell, whose term expires in February, is viewed by some inside and many outside the administration as the front-runner for the job. But if Mr. Biden decides he would prefer his own pick, rather than the Republican chosen by President Trump, Fed governor Lael Brainard is the...

This course—Lit 130, if memory serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could be applied to the reading of books. This was the heyday of deconstructionism—essentially a form of highly pretentious close reading, imported from France—and so we read quite a few texts looking for things that interested deconstructionists. But we also read Freudians, Marxists, feminists, and others.

Experts expect to see average inflation of 5.25% in December, slightly down from the current maximum predicted 5.4% figure, according to The Wall Street Journal.

In a new survey, more than half of both Biden and Trump voters view elected officials from the opposing party as “presenting a clear and present danger to American democracy.” More than 40% on each side say the same about anyone who strongly supports the opposing party. These are merely perceptions,...
__label__3 "We have a deal": Biden announces bipartisan compromise on infrastructurePresident Joe Biden threw his support behind an infrastructure proposal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, boosting momentum for the deal even as congressional leadership also presses forward with a larger bill addressing the more ambitious aspects of the president's agenda."We have a deal," Mr. Biden told reporters outside the White House after a meeting with the 11 senators of both parties who had negotiated the package. "We made serious compromises on both ends."
__label__2 Vaccine Mandates From Private Employers Are Destroying American LivelihoodsOPINION'Okay, you’re going to require me now to get this? Obviously, the booster shots are right behind it. It’s a never-ending cycle. What else are you going to tell me to do?' A growing number of Americans are facing the imminent loss of their livelihoods, economic uncertainty, and in some cases financial ruin, not because of mass layoffs prompted by economic recession or the collapse of their industries, but simply because they refuse to get a COVID-19 shot. These workers occupy every corner of the American economy, from health care...
__label__4 One Western town’s solution to wildfires? Community.As wildfires haunt the American West, Ashland, Oregon, has emerged as a leader in forest management. The city’s bipartisan approach hinges on a cooperative ethos that mitigates both fire risk and ideological divides. A municipal water tank built into the forested hills above Ashland offers postcard views of the mountain valley town on clear days. This warm September morning is not, alas, such a day. Wildfires burning elsewhere in Oregon and to the south in California have blurred the blue skies, turning the city into a soup bowl of ash-gray smoke....
__label__3 Congress' most successful bipartisan gang lives in the House — not the SenateA few dozen House members helped bring bipartisan talks back from the dead on a massive spending bill passed six months ago. Now they want to do it again — in President Joe Biden's Washington. The bipartisan 58-member coalition known as the Problem Solvers Caucus took something of a half-court buzzer shot this week by releasing its own version of an infrastructure deal, determined to keep talks alive between the president and Senate Republicans at least a bit longer before Democrats bound toward their own party-line bill. By Thursday afternoon,...

The company was the first U.S. carrier to mandate vaccines for all domestic employees, having announced its mandate in August. Employees were required to be vaccinated by Sept. 27, otherwise they would be terminated by Oct. 2. Those who refused the vaccine would be terminated outright. In a memo to employees on Tuesday, obtained by The Epoch Times, United Airlines Chief Executive Scott...
__label__5 Many people globally see United Nations in a positive light, including its handling of climate changeThe United Nations General Assembly begins its high-level general debate next week, during which heads of state are expected to address current crises facing the organization and its member nations, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and the situation in Afghanistan. A Pew Research Center analysis finds that the UN is seen in a positive light by most in the 17 publics surveyed this year: A median of 67% express a favorable opinion of the UN, compared with a median of 29% who have an unfavorable opinion. Majorities in Canada and the United States have...

__label__2 Steele dossier key player gave thousands to Hillary, DemsA key player in the debunked Steele dossier gave thousands of dollars to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, according to Federal Elections Commission (FEC) filings reviewed by Fox News. FEC filings reveal that Democrat spin doctor Charles Dolan has given over $60,000 to Democrats, including Clinton – whom Dolan volunteered for on her failed 2016 campaign. Dolan, who has boasted on his now-deleted Twitter profile to have worked on "every Democrat Presidential Campaign since 1980," gave Clinton $5,000 for her 2008 presidential campaign. The public relations executive also donated to climate envoy John...
__label__5 Padilla, Paul introduce bipartisan bill to protect 200,000 "Documented Dreamers"Sens. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday introduced a bill that seeks to provide a pathway to citizenship for the country's 200,000 "Documented Dreamers." Why it matters: Documented Dreamers are children of long-term visa holders who often wait years for a green card and face deportation if they don't receive legal immigration status after turning 21, when they lose dependent status. They come to the U.S. as dependents of long-term nonimmigrant visa holders, including H-1B, L-1, E-1 and E2 workers. Backlogs mean they often have to wait for...
__label__3 ‘They Learn to Parrot What They Know They’re Supposed to Say’OPINIONErin McLaughlin, an educator in Pennsylvania, believes that, in school and in life, people should study what others think and why. But in her estimation, many educational institutions that purport to value diversity and inclusion fail to treat viewpoint diversity—which she defines as “the recognition that nobody’s worldview is complete, and that no one marker of identity actually defines the way we see the world around us”—as a vital part of civic education. Her mission: to persuade educational institutions to put viewpoint diversity at the center of their cultures and...
__label__2 Walker off to fast start, hauling in $3.7M since launching Senate bidRepublican Senate candidate Herschel Walker has sprinted out of the blocks when it comes to fundraising for his Senate campaign to try and unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia in the 2022 midterm elections. The former professional and college football star running back, who won a Heisman Trophy and helped propel the University of Georgia to a national championship, announced Monday that his campaign pulled in $3.7 million — or about $100,000 per day — from his late August launch through the close of September, which marked the end of the third quarter of fundraising. Walker,...
__label__4 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__3 Biden to confront limits of bipartisanship in first meeting with Congress’ ‘Big Four’The White House has billed President Biden’s first formal meeting Wednesday with Congress’ “Big Four” leaders, two from each party, as an opportunity to talk about where Democrats and Republicans can find “common ground” on the country’s most pressing issues. The early signs aren’t good. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he was “100%” focused on stopping Biden’s agenda. And just hours before the White House meeting, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield will lead his caucus’ expulsion of Wyoming’s Rep. Liz Cheney from its...
__label__2 Biden turns on the Democratic Party fundraising machine for 2022President Joe Biden's dive into the pool of high-dollar fundraisers this summer comes with an appeal to party unity and the promise of nailing big-ticket Democratic priorities — if donors give. "The DNC is going to need you because here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big, consequential things," Biden said at a fundraising event in June. At another Democratic National Committee fundraiser on Monday, Biden delivered virtual remarks from the White House focused on rousing...
__label__5 From 9/11's ashes, a new world took shape. It did not last.ANALYSISIn the ghastly rubble of ground zero’s fallen towers 20 years ago, Hour Zero arrived, a chance to start anew. World affairs reordered abruptly on that morning of blue skies, black ash, fire and death. In Iran, chants of “death to America” quickly gave way to candlelight vigils to mourn the American dead. Vladimir Putin weighed in with substantive help as the U.S. prepared to go to war in Russia’s region of influence. Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, a murderous dictator with a poetic streak, spoke of the “human duty” to be...
__label__3 Democrats and Republicans need a translator when speaking infrastructureANALYSISDemocrats and Republicans in Washington often do not speak the same language anymore. Just as there are “red” and “blue” states, there are “red” and “blue” versions of infrastructure proposals. Democrats have an expansive view of infrastructure, including such things as home-care services, that Republicans deride as not “real” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. Meanwhile, Democrats want to add spending on top of existing appropriations, while Republicans include existing spending in their numbers, which make their budget proposals look bigger.
__label__1 House Republicans Grow Midterm Cash Advantage Over DemsThe House Republican fundraising arm outraised its Democratic counterpart in May, according to figures shared by the organizations. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised over $14 million last month, its third straight record-breaking month for fundraising, the group says. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the same month brought in just under $10 million. The May fundraising hauls bring the NRCC's cash on hand to $42.1 million, topping the DCCC's cash reserves by $6 million. Both groups have scored record fundraising numbers this year. The DCCC narrowly outraised the NRCC in April, but a $5...
__label__5 This charity eliminates the middleman – cutting waste and expensesIn a city with as much abundance as there is need, a tiny Manhattan nonprofit aims to reallocate the excess – one cookie, one blender, and one bike helmet at a time.    Over the past four years, House of Good Deeds has funneled more than 150,000 pounds of clothes, household items, computers, catering equipment, and more from donors to recipients – keeping it out of landfills. Unlike organizations with concrete goals – disaster relief, ending homelessness, promoting literacy – this shoestring operation has a more profound purpose: fostering altruism. ...
__label__3 GOP Lawmakers Release Surprisingly Great COVID-19 Vaccine AdANALYSISRepublican members of Congress who also happen to be medical professionals released a video on Tuesday encouraging people to get COVID-19 vaccinations ― an important public health message meant to counter vaccine hesitancy among their constituents. The video, organized by the 18-member GOP “Doctors’ Caucus,” stresses the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the U.S. government’s “rigorous and transparent” process of overseeing their development. “The FDA did not skip any steps,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), an anesthesiologist and caucus co-chair, assures about COVID-19 vaccines in the ad.  “The only way...

Nicholas and Joby Pritzker—members of Illinois Democratic governor J.B. Pritzker's megadonor family—own nearly 12 million shares of ArcLight through their venture capital fund, Tao Capital. ArcLight in January announced a $1.6 billion merger with Proterra, which will see the electric vehicle manufacturer go public in 2021. Granholm served on Proterra's board for nearly four years and still holds...
__label__4 Poll Shows 81% Of Americans Support Taking In Afghans Who Assisted U.S.The vast majority of Americans in both parties support taking in Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the war in Afghanistan, a new poll found, as more than a half dozen Republican governors express support for taking in Afghan refugees. KEY FACTS A CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday found 81% of the 2,142 U.S. adults surveyed said the U.S. should “help those Afghans come to the U.S.,” while just 19% said they should not. Taking in those Afghans, who worked as translators, intelligence sources, drivers and in other support...
__label__3 Fewer boots, more slippers: How a shortage of shipping containers is changing what shows up on shelvesThe furniture giant Ikea is known for flattening tables, chairs and even beds into compact bundles that can be lugged home in car trunks and pickup beds. Now its executives are using that expertise to squeeze as many seasonal offerings as possible into massive metal boxes for ocean transport. They prioritized lightweight and pliable — pillows and throws, wine glasses and plates — and holiday perennials like children’s easels and toys, said Javier Quiñones, chief executive of Ikea U.S. The desks, chairs and home office accessories that were big sellers early in the...
__label__2 The Science Behind the Trump Campaign's Recurring DonationsANALYSISEarlier this month, the New York Times reported that starting in March 2020, the Trump campaign had tricked many donors into signing up to make repeated donations, even when the donor intended to donate only once.  When supporters made donations through the WinRed website, the default setting—a checked box that the user would have to uncheck to opt out—would sign them up to make recurring donations—once a month or (later in the campaign) once a week, at the same dollar amount. The Times told the story of a donor...
__label__4 Where there’s smoke, there’s fire – and political unityANALYSISThe acrid smoke from massive wildfires that ignited in rural eastern Washington last Labor Day weekend drifted over the Cascades before blanketing the state’s populous western flank. Ashen clouds darkened the skies above Seattle, Tacoma, and the capital, Olympia, looming like a rebuke of state lawmakers for failing to alleviate a worsening wildfire crisis. The memory of that spectacle lingered after the haze cleared, and when the Legislature convened in January, a sense of urgency – and unity – prevailed in the statehouse. Republicans joined with Democrats to unanimously approve a wide-ranging wildfire...
__label__3 As supply lines strain, some corporations rewrite production playbookThe pandemic caught Stanley Black & Decker midway through an overhaul of its 18-country supply chain. Executives at the toolmaker’s New Britain, Conn., headquarters already had shifted most production of heavy-duty industrial products closer to customers in the United States and Europe. But efforts to do the same with Stanley’s popular hand tools were unfinished when the coronavirus pandemic began disrupting global commerce. This year, as ports grew clogged, Stanley saw its freight bills jump by a factor of seven, endured months-long shipping delays and scrambled to obtain computer chips...
__label__2 Black Lives Matter foundation raised more than $90M in 2020The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation claims to have raised more than $90 million in 2020, a year filled with protests against racial inequality and police brutality. A report released this week also said that the foundation had $8.4 million in expenses in 2020 and announced plans to share $21.7 million in grants to a variety of leftist activist groups and local BLM chapters. Patrisse Cullors, the executive director of the BLM Global Network Foundation and a self-described Marxist who formed the BLM national organization with Alicia Garza and...
__label__5 A timely lesson from a tiny town long agoANALYSISRecently, a friend gave me the book “A Stronger Kinship” by historian Anna-Lisa Cox. It tells of Covert, Michigan, a small town 30 miles from my friend’s childhood home.  His nearly all-white high school had played them in sports, yet only now was he learning that more than a century ago, Black and white residents of Covert had “lived as equal citizens,” as the book puts it.  As far back as the 1860s, they treated each other as neighbors regardless of race, farming side by side. Black men not only...

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols also ordered Bradley Rukstales, of Inverness, Illinois, to pay $500 in restitution, court records show. Rukstales previously acknowledged he stormed the Capitol, threw a chair in the direction of police officers who had been forced to retreat from rioters, was nearby as a melee between officers and rioters broke...
__label__2 Left-Wing ‘Dark Money’ Networks Hid Millions in the 2020 ElectionsDespite repeated calls for increased campaign finance transparency, President Joe Biden and other Democrats received tens of millions of dollars in assistance from massive "dark money" networks during the 2020 election cycle.  The Sixteen Thirty Fund, which houses dozens of liberal groups and projects, pumped $60 million into committees backing Biden and other Democrats. Tides Advocacy, a similar group part of a larger dark money network, spent $1.6 million.  Dark money groups pouring large sums into elections is nothing new. But the 2020 election marks the first time...
__label__5 This Democrat wants to fix potholes with Republicans, not steamroll themKyrsten Sinema, a once-strident liberal who now charts a pragmatic path, is spearheading Congress’ most significant infrastructure bill in years. Some Democrats see the bipartisan effort as capitulation. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema knows a thing or two about crusading for justice. As an activist back in the early 2000s, she protested the Iraq War in a pink tutu. And as a first-term Arizona state legislator, she routinely delivered scathing speeches against her Republican opponents, marching back to her office filled with righteous indignation – only to see the GOP’s bills pass.  Now,...

The remaining company will consist of GE Aviation, its jet-engine division.  “What we’re doing today is creating three outstanding investment-grade,...
__label__2 Biden Institute Won’t Disclose DonorsThe Biden Institute, a policy research center founded by Joe Biden at the University of Delaware, has no plans to disclose its donors after the president-elect takes office, Politico reported on Monday. Legal experts and watchdog groups said the lack of transparency could create an ethical dilemma for Biden, particularly if he keeps his name on the institute and it continues to fundraise while he’s in the White House. "They should at the very least disclose their donors, and I think the Biden family should at the very least take...
__label__5 Hopes and fears: Why Cuban protesters rally American left and rightWhen a video emerged from Cuba’s unprecedented anti-regime demonstrations this month of a Havana protester waving the American flag, the political right in the United States was quick to seize on the display as proof that Cubans hate communism and want American-style freedom. Some on social media juxtaposed the image of the Cuban waving the Stars and Stripes with scenes of American protesters burning flags at last summer’s police brutality and anti-racism demonstrations. Not to be outdone, the lead organization in the Black Lives Matter movement also felt compelled to...
__label__2 How Republicans used Senate delays to make changes at U.S. product safety regulator. Critics call it a ‘power grab’ that puts public at risk.A short-lived Republican majority atop the nation’s product safety regulator — the result of Senate delays in confirming Democratic nominees — recently pushed through dozens of last-minute changes to the agency’s annual plan, slowing work on some safety rules and abandoning at least one enforcement effort altogether. The changes mean the Consumer Product Safety Commission no longer plans in the coming year to draw up new mandatory rules for preventing suffocation in infant nursing pillows or carbon monoxide poisoning from gas appliances. The amended plan also canceled a pilot project...
__label__1 Gavin Newsom recall effort just got a major boostThe California governor’s days could be limited thanks to a growing effort to invoke a statewide referendum.  A campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom is picking up steam after individual donors offered tens of thousands of dollars each and they scored $500,000 from an Irvine-based consulting firm.  Prov 3:9 LLC contributed $500,000, and Sequoia Capital's Douglas Leone and his wife Patricia Perkins-Leone contributed roughly $100,000.  Since 1911, Californians have attempted to recall their governor 55 times, but were successful only in 2003 against Gov. Gray Davis, who...
__label__5 Could a voter ID compromise be a win for voting rights?Faced with the reality that their ambitious voting rights reform plan may be permanently stalled in the Senate, Democrats have begun to soften their opposition to a policy they once criticized as the epitome of voter suppression: voter ID laws. The specifics vary from state to state, but voter ID laws generally require a person to present some form of identification in order to cast a ballot. These laws were relatively rare in the United States until the past two decades, when they became increasingly common in states led by Republican...
__label__3 It’s time for Americans to buy less stuffOPINIONIn September, I started getting pesky emails from brands hinting that I should get a head start on my holiday shopping. Next came the headlines, and then the reminders from social media users dishing out the same advice. Holiday shopping starts a little earlier every year, but this isn’t just the typical push. People are encouraged to order their gifts as soon as possible or risk having packages arrive late, due to rampant supply chain disruptions and mailing delays. Even books (yes, books!) aren’t safe from the impending shortages. The holiday shopping industrial...

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have reserved $168.5 million worth of ads up to the Jan. 5 runoff, while their respective Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev.

__label__5 Infrastructure Deal Tests Whether Bipartisanship Can SurviveThe big infrastructure deal President Biden and a group of senators from both parties announced Thursday is about much more than infrastructure. It may well be a test of whether bipartisanship can survive in today’s Washington on any big subject. After all, if bipartisanship can’t be achieved on infrastructure—the motherhood-and-apple-pie issue of our times, where every lawmaker gets to send some federal dollars back home for projects their constituents can see and use—where can it happen? That doesn’t mean the $1.2 trillion deal—which would represent one of the biggest investments ever...

The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under...

This week, the company announced a $200-a-year program that promises consumers lower prices and exclusive access to hard-to-find devices. While the new membership also includes 24/7 tech support and free shipping, the idea of guaranteed product availability might be particularly appealing to shoppers worried that their orders won’t arrive in time for the holidays. The new Best Buy service is a stark reminder that retailers don’t anticipate that supply chain issues, including the global semiconductor chip...

Heated fights are underway for a number of Senate seats this year, and each one is critical for control of the upper chamber of Congress, which signs off on both cabinet nominations and judgeships. The Iowa seat could mean the difference between a Democratic sweep and Republicans retaining a majority. In Iowa, polls indicate enthusiasm has been building for incumbent...
__label__5 How Some Americans Are Breaking Out of Political Echo ChambersLAST OCTOBER, STUDENTS in Sarah Candler’s seventh-grade English class in rural Tennessee were discussing the presidential election, echoing each other’s pro-Trump sentiments. One student dared the others: “Who’s a Democrat, anyway?” A lone girl raised her hand. “I saw looks aghast from the other kids,” recalls Candler. Then Candler, too, raised her hand. The closed-minded dialog troubled Candler. She began searching online for resources beyond her go-to mainstream news sources, such as The New York Times, to help her understand others’ politics. She found AllSides, a site founded by former Netscape director John...
__label__3 Everything Is Getting More ExpensiveConsumer prices rose more than economists expected last month, new numbers show, on top of an already high August reading. While a jump in prices was expected as the economy recovered from the pandemic shock, persistently high inflation is complicating plans for both the Fed and the White House, who face pressure to act so that price gains don’t become a permanent fixture. Americans are paying more for dinner, fuel and housing, and wage gains, while decent, aren’t keeping up. Hopes that a spike in prices would quickly fade — that pandemic-induced...
__label__1 Biden Campaign Raising Money To Fund Post-Election Challenges, LitigationJoe Biden’s presidential campaign is well ahead in fundraising but it seems some of that money is going to “pre-fund” legal costs that could be associated with a protracted battle over the results of November’s presidential election. Biden, the Daily Beast notes, has around $435 million on hand — a record amount for a presidential campaign — and is raising around $150 per minute, making the 2020 election one of the costliest in history. At the rate Biden has been bringing in money, the outlet explains, he could stop fundraising...

__label__2 Joe Biden breaks 'ambitious' campaign promise to address student loans, proposal missing from budgetANALYSISPresident Joe Biden is breaking one of his central campaign promises, surely upsetting progressives who wanted Biden to unilaterally cancel the massive bill of student loan debt that Americans have accumulated. As of June 2020, outstanding federal student loan debt was $1.57 trillion, which included nearly 43 million borrowers. Biden's campaign website stated ambitious promises to "more than halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans," "make loan forgiveness work for public servants," and even to "make public colleges and universities tuition-free for all families with incomes below $125,000." Biden reaffirmed his promise...
__label__5 Respect: Is it the glue a polarized nation needs?Respect is a core civic value to American democracy, but it can also be used as a tool of repression. As a fractured nation seeks to knit itself together, the ability to disagree yet not hate is seen as essential. This is part of the Monitor’s Respect Project. Marquis Fulghum can get a little irritated with topics like tolerance. “When someone says they will tolerate me, it invokes a negative idea or feeling, and I’m not thinking this person accepts who I am,” Mr. Fulghum said at a recent public...

__label__4 Nine in 20 of us identify as independents. So how can we be polarized?OPINIONGallup's fresh quarterly assessment of Americans' political leanings finds 44 percent of Americans regard themselves as independents. This is a remarkable statistic — especially because we are living in a time when traditional media and social media continue to hammer away at the claim that we are a nation that is polarized. Our people are polarized and, the media's conventional wisdom holds, that is why they have sent politicians to Washington to engage in very little but horrific trench warfare — the policymaking equivalent of what happened when the Allies...

__label__4 Biden redefined ‘bipartisan.’ GOP moderates say it leaves them out.Can a bill be bipartisan if it passes with only Democratic votes? The Biden administration says yes, if it includes GOP ideas and Republican voters support it. Republicans say the White House is courting a backlash. The last time Joe Biden gave a big speech on Capitol Hill, moderate Republican lawmakers were buoyed by what they heard. The newly sworn-in president might be a Democrat, but he had spent 36 years in the Senate. He understood Congress and how deals were done. On that blustery January day, as their former...
__label__3 Trump raised millions but spent none of it on audits and GOP candidatesSix months since leaving office, former President Donald Trump is sitting on a $102 million war chest. But having whipped his supporters into a frenzy with pledges to overturn the election and promises to support Republican candidates in the midterms, he is not spending his campaign money on either. A review of election filings from Make America Great Again PAC, Save America PAC, and the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee show that not a single penny was transferred or contributed from those Trump-affiliated entities to GOP candidates or committees involved...

__label__3 Critical race theory battle invades school boards — with help from conservative groupsA booby-trapped billboard. A list of demands. A conservative media frenzy. Jeff Porter, superintendent of a wealthy suburban school district in Maine, had no idea that his community was about to become part of a national battle when in the summer of 2020 a father began accusing the district of trying to “indoctrinate” his children by teaching critical race theory. To Porter, the issue was straightforward: The district had denounced white supremacy in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by police, but did not teach critical race theory, the academic study of...
__label__1 Biden ‘nothing we can do’ comment on coronavirus contrasts with campaign optimismPresident Biden's lament Friday that there is "nothing we can do" to alter the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic stood in contrast to previous declarations that he would defeat COVID-19. During the campaign, Biden exuded greater optimism about his ability to tackle the problem, releasing a "seven-point plan" to "beat COVID-19" and promising "decisive public health and economic steps necessary to get the virus under control." In November, Biden said he was going to "shut down" coronavirus once in office. "I am not going to shut down the economy, period....

__label__5 Why conglomerates break themselves upANALYSISThree giant conglomerates announced their breakups in the past week. All of them are seeking to put their recent past behind them. Why it matters: GE, Johnson & Johnson, and Toshiba weren't the last of the conglomerates. Giants both old and new remain. (Think 3M, or Softbank.) In today's financially-optimized stock market, however, the arguments for internal diversification have mostly lost the day. Driving the news: GE is splitting into three parts; J&J is splitting into two; Toshiba is splitting into three. In each case, the newly-independent businesses are going to be a lot easier to describe than...

__label__5 Who still thinks inflation is transitory?Is inflation transitory? Executives are talking about it more than ever, but there’s little agreement on whether the spike in price increases will be sticky or fleeting. The word “transitory” has been mentioned more than 200 times in November, according to transcripts of earnings calls, conferences, and shareholder meetings compiled by Sentieo, a financial data platform. That’s already a monthly record, even though November is only half over. Discussions about price increases between executives and analysts have reached a fever pitch as US inflation rose in October at the fastest pace in 30 years.

__label__3 Democrats Now Dominate Dark Money Spending. They Still Want To End It.Democrats are pushing a sweeping package of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms as their top legislative priority in 2021. One of the pieces of the bill is a section requiring independent political groups that currently don’t have to disclose their donors ― whose donations are known as “dark money” ― to finally do so.  This provision, previously known as the DISCLOSE Act, has been a major part of Democrats’ campaign finance reform agenda for years. But one major thing has changed since 2010, when Republicans dominated dark...

Ordinarily, a presidential transition would be largely taxpayer-funded, but that money cannot be released until the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Emily Murphy, officially “ascertains” that Biden won the election. Despite the election having been called for Biden by all major media outlets — and despite the fact that key states have begun to certify his wins — Murphy has refused to do so.

__label__5 Appeals court rules Dylann Roof death penalty-eligible for church massacreDylann Roof, the white gunman who killed nine black people in the 2015 Charleston church massacre, is one step closer to execution after a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled he’s eligible to receive the death penalty. “His crimes qualify him for the harshest penalty that a just society can impose,” a three-judge panel for the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote, according to The State newspaper. Roof was convicted in 2017 of slaughtering nine parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston after planning the attack for months in an...
__label__3 Biggest U.S. Retailers Charter Private Cargo Ships to Sail Around Port DelaysGlobal supply-chain delays are so severe that some of the biggest U.S. retailers have resorted to an extreme—and expensive—tactic to try to stock shelves this holiday season: They are chartering their own cargo ships to import goods. Port delays, Covid-19 outbreaks and worker shortages have snarled the flow of products between Asia and North America, threatening the supplies of everything from holiday decorations and toys to appliances and furniture. It is taking roughly 80 days to transport goods across the Pacific, or twice as long as before the pandemic, retail and...
__label__1 How a Stephen Miller Fox News Appearance Launched the “Border Crisis”ANALYSISIs there a crisis at the U.S.–Mexico border? It depends on your definition of crisis. The monthly number of individuals being apprehended there for unauthorized crossings is higher than it was two years ago, pre-coronavirus, and given seasonal trends this summer’s totals might end up being higher than those observed at any point during Donald Trump’s term. But on an absolute basis there are still fewer crossings being documented than there were during the summer of 2019, and many fewer than were routinely recorded during the first decade of the...
__label__4 Justice Department Asks Supreme Court To Allow Execution Of Four Child MurderersThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court Monday night to clear the way for four federal executions, after a judge in Washington, D.C., put them on hold. The first of the executions is set for Dec. 9. The condemned inmate is Daniel Lewis Lee, who belonged to a white supremacist organization. A jury sentenced him to death for the 1999 murders of three people, among them an 8-year-old girl. Juries also convicted the other convicts — Alfred Bourgeois, Dustin Lee Honken and Wesley Ira Purkey — for the murders of...
__label__3 An entire block of vacant storefronts: Delayed office return plans stymie midtown Manhattan’s recoveryBefore the pandemic, it would take Rob Byrnes at least 15 minutes to wait in line and grab a quick lunch at a fast-casual restaurant in midtown Manhattan. Now, in the minority of people returning to office buildings in the area, Byrnes says he’s in and out with his meal in under two minutes. But he’d much prefer to be standing in a line full of people again. “We’re nowhere near where we need to be to have a sustained retail and restaurant climate in this area,” said Byrnes, president...
__label__2 Trump Held A Delusional MAGA Rally As Congress Prepared To Confirm He LostANALYSISAs Congress began the process of formally confirming Joe Biden’s presidency on Wednesday, President Donald Trump falsely claimed victory at a rambling, delusional last-ditch rally in front of thousands of protesters gathered in front of the White House. The unprecedented split screen was the culmination of Trump’s futile monthslong campaign to overturn the results of the November election. Trump attacked his own “weak” Republican Party, ran through a long litany of false allegations of election fraud, and urged his vice president, Mike Pence, to illegally reject states’ Electoral College votes.
__label__4 Meet Tom Drake, the NSA Whistleblower Cheney Wanted to ‘Fry’“Find and fry the leaker or leakers. Burn them. We have to make an example of them.” Vice President Dick Cheney issued that edict after whistleblower Thomas Drake, a former senior executive at the NSA, revealed the unconstitutional mass surveillance regime that had been instituted after 9/11, Drake himself said in a recent interview with The American Conservative. The constant drumbeat of demands to reveal the names of whistleblowers who filed a complaint against President Trump gives Drake horrible “flashbacks,” he says. And while Republicans endlessly repeat that the American...
__label__3 Ford announces $11.4bn investment in electric vehicle plantsFord has announced a major investment in electric vehicle (EV) production in the US, promising to build its biggest ever factory in Tennessee, and two battery parks in Kentucky. Under the $11.4bn (£8.3bn) plan, the carmaker said it will build zero-emission cars and pickups "at scale" for American customers. It will also create 11,000 jobs. Like rivals GM and Stellantis, Ford hopes around half of the cars it sells by 2030 will be zero emission. Yet the additional government investment required to make it happen is still in question....
__label__2 Georgia Republicans vow legislation to limit mail voting despite no evidence of fraudGeorgia Republicans on Tuesday outlined a plan to restrict mail voting and roll back the election laws that contributed to the state's record-high turnout in the presidential election — unwinding rules the party itself put in place.The framework for legislation — which would eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, add a voter ID requirement to mail ballots for voters with an eligible excuse and eliminate drop boxes — appears designed to respond to President Donald Trump's repeated and false claims that mail voting is rife with fraud.
__label__4 Georgia Intends to Execute This Man, Whether or Not He Pulled the TriggerThe State of Georgia plans to execute Ray Jefferson Cromartie, 52, at the end of the month. DNA evidence might prove that another man pulled the trigger, but the authorities have refused to do the tests to find out. That's because Cromartie participated in the robbery that led to a man's death, making him a party to the crime. Under State Code 16-2-20, Georgia still considers him responsible for the murder, even if he didn't actually fire the shot. Cromartie was convicted of the 1994 death of store clerk Richard...
__label__3 Costco, Nike and FedEx are warning there’s more inflation set to hit consumers as holidays approachShipping bottlenecks that have led to rising freight costs are cooking up a holiday headache for U.S. retailers.Costco this week joined the long list of retailers sounding the alarm about escalating shipping prices and the accompanying supply chain issues. The warehouse retailer, which had a similar cautionary tone in May, was joined by athletic wear giant Nike and economic bellwethers FedEx and General Mills in warning of similar concerns.
__label__2 The greatest commandment has guided my politicsOPINIONIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is asked, “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,’” he said. “This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” These abiding principles – loving God and loving others – are at the very foundation of my faith. Throughout my career in public...
__label__4 OPINION: The Supreme Court’s Absurd Death-Penalty DebateOPINIONThis is not jurisprudence but jurispretext. The headlines say the justices of the Supreme Court are “openly feuding” and “sniping” at one another over the death penalty. What they are in fact doing is nibbling around the edges. Some opponents of the death penalty wish to see the Supreme Court declare it unconstitutional, and they are not too picky about how that gets done: not jurisprudence but jurispretext. The problem with that is that the Constitution itself categorically sanctions capital punishment, for instance by specifying in the Fifth Amendment certain...
__label__3 How the first truly continental railroad could change North American tradeFreight trains may soon travel more easily between Canada, the US, and Mexico after Canadian Pacific Railway finalized a deal to buy Kansas City Southern, positioning itself to become the first rail network connecting the three countries.The agreement, which is valued at $27 billion, comes after a lengthy battle between Canadian Pacific and its rival, Canadian National, which submitted a $30 billion counter-offer to Kansas City Southern in March that was ultimately rejected by a US regulatory panel.
__label__2 How will Biden deal with Trump's personal attacks at Thursday's debate?Former Vice President Joe Biden has hunkered down in Delaware ahead of his final turn on the debate stage with President Donald Trump -- a high stakes and highly anticipated match-up that will serve as the second and final time voters will see the two candidates go head-to-head. Despite there being only a dozen days left before final ballots are cast, Biden has remained solidly focused on debate prep this week, meeting with advisers in Wilmington, Delaware, in lieu of public campaigning, even as Trump eschews traditional debate preparation in...
__label__5 OPINION: Gavin Newsom’s Death-Penalty OverreachOPINIONGavin Newsom, the newly inaugurated governor of California, would very much like to be president of the United States someday. It is fitting, then, that Newsom has begun his audition for the role by engaging in the sort of brazen executive overreach that we have become accustomed to seeing from White Houses. On Tuesday, Newsom confirmed that no executions will be performed in California while he is governor. This change, he explained, will be made unilaterally, without reference to either the legislature or the judiciary, by applying his gubernatorial reprieve...
__label__3 The National Trust for Local News is trying to build a $300 million fund to help save local newsIn the crowded field of nonprofits supporting local news ventures, Elizabeth Hansen Shapiro’s National Trust for Local News stands out as something distinct. Rather than grants, the trust makes investments. Advice and some control come with the help. But the point is for recipients to gather other investors and develop models for serving small-town news deserts that are losing all local coverage. I refer to the project as Hansen Shapiro’s because she developed the idea, first as a Ph.D. thesis, then as a research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, and now as a...
__label__1 The strange, sudden, bipartisan avoidance of Roe v. WadeANALYSISThe nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court could prove pivotal on abortion rights. As was first revealed last week, Barrett in 2006 signed on to a newspaper ad calling for “an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.” And even if a new 6-to-3 conservative majority wouldn’t overturn Roe, it could allow the court to chip away at abortion rights in many other ways — as Barrett has more recently suggested. But you almost wouldn’t know that by watching last week’s presidential debate and Wednesday...
__label__5 Pope Francis’s Challenging Lesson in MercyThe Holy Father’s teaching on the death penalty is a development, not a contradiction, because it adapts the same principles of the faith to new situations.
__label__3 Giuliani associate Lev Parnas convicted of campaign finance crimesFlorida businessman Lev Parnas was convicted Friday on charges of conspiracy to make foreign contributions to political campaigns, according to multiple outlets. Why it matters: Prosecutors said Parnas, then an associate of former President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, funneled over $150,000 from a Russian businessman into U.S. campaigns as part of an effort to land licenses in the U.S.'s legal cannabis industry. Parnas also worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating President Biden for alleged corruption in the lead-up to the 2020 election. Details: A jury found Parnas guilty of scheming to...
__label__1 Neither Vice Presidential Candidate Wanted To Talk About Their Boss’ HealthNeither Vice President Mike Pence nor Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was particularly interested in talking about the health of the septuagenarians at the top of their party’s respective tickets during Wednesday’s vice presidential debate. When asked if the American people deserved more information about the health of both President Donald Trump, 74, and former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, their running mates quickly pivoted to other topics, preferring not to discuss a sensitive issue for both parties. Pence attacked Harris over her skepticism toward Trump’s effort to rush a coronavirus...
__label__5 Don’t Kill the Death Penalty in CaliforniaOpponents of California’s death penalty have been highly successful at thwarting executions since the state resumed executions in 1992 after a 20-year hiatus. Their latest ploy is Proposition 62, which would repeal the death penalty and resentence death row inmates to life without parole. Measure sponsors argue that capital punishment presents the risk of executing an innocent person, but also state that California’s death penalty is “simply unworkable.”
__label__3 As Virginia governor’s race tightens, McAuliffe and Youngkin report big fundraising numbersAs the Virginia gubernatorial race between former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and businessman Glenn Youngkin (R) tightens, Youngkin raised nearly $4 million more than McAulliffe in the latest reporting period giving him a race-leading total of $35.2 million. The former Democratic governor of Virginia was once seen as the favorite in the 2021 gubernatorial race. In McAuliffe’s last quarter in office in 2017, a Morning Consult survey found he had a 47% approval rating, landing him with a net 15% approval. At the time, McAuliffe was reportedly considering a presidential run in 2020 but ultimately decided not to run when...
__label__2 Joe Biden Condemns Racial Injustice, Calls for Fully Funding PoliceFormer Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Tuesday, where he called for national unity and healing from one of the most famous battlefields of the Civil War. During his 22-minute address, Biden appealed to Americans to listen to scientists and to wear masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also acknowledged centuries of racial injustice in the U.S., even as he rejected calls by the Movement for Black Lives to dismantle or defund the police.
__label__4 Nebraska AG fighting to block death penalty repeal from reversing death row sentencesNebraska's top lawyer is headed to court to prevent the state's sweeping death penalty repeal from reversing sentences of those already on death row -- in the latest flare-up between the legislature and Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts' administration. The legislature delivered a blow to the governor Wednesday when it voted 30-19 to override Ricketts' veto of legislation that would put an end to capital punishment in Nebraska. With the power play by the state's Republican-dominated legislature, Nebraska becomes the first conservative state in decades t
__label__3 "Perfect storm" blocks Trump-era FEC probesA "perfect storm" of procedural blockades prevented the investigation and sanctioning of alleged Trump campaign election law violations, regulators said this week. Why it matters: Legitimate cases are being dismissed. And critics say the Federal Election Commission's inability to crack down on many bad actors has undercut the threat of enforcement, and turned campaign financing into the Wild West. What's new: The FEC is clearing out a backlog of Trump-related cases. One of them, officially tossed last month, shows how the nation's top political money regulator has been hobbled. The case stemmed from a...
__label__2 Examining Trump claim that Hunter Biden got $3.5 million from wife of Moscow ex-mayorFACT CHECKPresident Donald Trump, who himself faces questions about his ties to Russia, hinted at some sort of murky dealings involving the son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. "Hunter Biden got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow, Trump said Sept. 27 at a press conference. "Why did he get three and a half million dollars?" Any details or proof about that alleged transaction lie with undisclosed documents cited in a report issued by the Republican majority on the Senate Finance and Homeland...
__label__4 O’Malley reacts to Tsarnaev verdict: ‘Death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent’Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Friday that the death penalty sentence for Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was “ineffective.”While the likely Democratic presidential candidate said that he “respects the verdict of the jury” and said his prayers go to the victims and their loved ones, he used the occasion to make another statement on his opposition to the death penalty.“The dea

Driving the news: Concerned Veterans for America, a foreign policy-focused arm of Charles Koch's Stand Together political and policy apparatus is coming to Biden's defense after the U.S. withdrawal handed control of the country to the Taliban this week. The Koch political network was one of the foremost antagonists of the Obama administration in which Biden served as vice president. What they're saying: "I think he made the right decision to withdraw,"...
__label__1 Trump’s wrongs on court, virus; Biden errsFACT CHECKWASHINGTON (AP) — In a momentous week, President Donald Trump painted a fantastical portrait of a coronavirus that affects “virtually nobody” among the young as he faced a grim U.S. milestone of 200,000 deaths and he asserted a constitutional basis that doesn’t exist for rushing a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg over her dying wishes. As Americans absorbed news of a grand jury decision not to prosecute Kentucky police officers for killing Breonna Taylor, Trump’s campaign pointed to purported economic progress for Blacks under his administration that...
__label__5 Gov. Herbert 'leaning toward' signing firing squad billWith roughly 490 bills awaiting his consideration, Gov. Gary Herbert indicated Thursday he’s “leaning toward” signing one of the most controversial pieces of legislation passed during the 2015 Utah Legislature. HB11, which survived narrow votes in the House and Senate, would allow firing squad executions in the absence of lethal injection drugs. During his monthly news conference, Herbert also discussed the progress of two major disputes that have yet to be resolved — the potential relocation of the Utah State Prison, and the failure to reach a compromise on Medicaid...
__label__3 Gretchen Whitmer Accused of 'Illegal Scheme' in Campaign Finance ComplaintDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is being sued by a conservative group that has alleged Whitmer broke campaign finance laws by accepting massive donations which exceed those allowed by law. The Michigan Freedom Fund, which says its mission is to fight for conservative policies on behalf of Michigan’s taxpayers, sued Whitmer for accepting more than the minimum of $7,150 from individual donors after viewing her re-election campaign’s financial disclosure from this calendar year. The group said Whitmer has accepted $3.4 million in what it called “illegal contributions” from at least 154 individual...

The proposals that include prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan and Antifa as terrorist organizations, making Juneteenth a federal holiday and efforts to bolster Black economic prosperity. During an Atlanta event announcing what was deemed the Black Economic Empowerment "Platinum Plan," Trump sought to draw contrasts between his plan for the African American community and Joe...
__label__4 Poll: Republican Support for Death Penalty Drops 9 PointsSince Gallup first started asking about people’s views on the death penalty in 1937, Americans have on all but one occasion favored the practice. Nonetheless, it has been a controversial issue in society, with the divide especially pronounced between Democrats and Republicans. The former have tended to oppose the practice, while the latter, for the most part, have supported it. Increasingly, however, we’re seeing a growing divide on the Right over capital punishment—a debate that intensified after the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma earlier this year. While 63...
__label__3 Midterm-Election Ad Spending Poised to Soar as Streaming TV Attracts CampaignsA top advertising-industry observer expects elections this year and next will see political ad expenditures of roughly $9 billion, more than doubling the amount spent in the 2018 midterm cycle. The spots are also likely to increasingly appear on television screens connected to the Internet by streaming-video players such as those made by Roku Inc., which dominates the device portion of a rapidly growing market known as connected TV. AdImpact, a firm based just outside Washington, says in a report first shared with The Wall Street Journal that it expects ad spending to...
__label__2 Trump’s made-up car plants, court revisionismFACT CHECKWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his GOP allies are playing loose with the facts when it comes to a successor for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Seeking to justify a possible confirmation vote before the Nov. 3 election, Trump asserted over the weekend that many high court nominations were made in an election year and “in all cases, they went forward.” That’s clearly not true. In fact, just one hour after Justice Antonin Scalia’s unexpected death in February 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly made clear...
__label__4 Biden exits three-hour Xi summit with no White House mention of China’s growing nuke arsenalPresident Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met via video teleconference for more than three hours on Monday night, discussing a wide slate of issues at a moment of growing international concern over Cold War prospects between the U.S. and the world’s biggest communist power. While China‘s military muscle-flexing and advancements — including its rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and a recent test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile — have made global headlines in recent months, a White House summary of Monday night’s call made no mention of a specific discussion on such matters between Mr. Biden and...
__label__3 Here Are The Billionaires Backing California’s Governor And His Opponent Caitlyn JennerCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election in two months, has drawn far more support from billionaire donors than any of his opponents — by a compelling margin.  Altogether, 23 billionaires have donated to a California gubernatorial candidate, according to a search of the California Secretary of State’s Cal-Access Campaign Finance database. Of those, 19 have backed Newsom, donating a combined $5.7  million while three have thrown their financial weight behind Republican challenger Caitlyn Jenner. Just one has donated to former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, also...
__label__2 Did Kamala Harris Tell Jacob Blake She Was ‘Proud of Him’?FACT CHECKClaim: U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris met with Jacob Blake — who, a meme claimed, "raped a woman” — and told him that she was “proud of him” in September 2020. Rating: Mixture What's True: According to a statement from Blake’s lawyer, Harris met with Blake's family and told Blake on the phone that she is “proud of him and how he is working through his pain.” In July 2020, Blake was charged with third-degree sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend. What's False: Blake has not been tried or convicted of sexual...
__label__4 China And The ‘G’ Word—GenocideOPINIONThough it acts as a court, it has no official status. The governments asked to participate have either snubbed or (in the case of China) condemned it. Some witnesses, under threat of sanctions from Beijing, started dropping out before its proceedings had even begun. And yet, the Uyghur Tribunal, whose final hearings took place in London in September, is an institution nobody can afford to ignore. It offers the best hope yet of answering a pressing question: is China committing genocide against the Uyghurs, the 12 million Turkic Muslims in...
__label__3 Supreme Court strikes down disclosure rules for political donorsThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a California law that required nonprofits to hand over a list of their biggest donors. Why it matters: Some campaign-finance advocates have feared the court will begin chipping away at disclosure rules more broadly, making it harder and harder to figure out who’s funding major political causes. The big picture: In a 6-3 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said California had subjected donors to the threat of public harassment and intimidation, undermining their First Amendment right to free association. Background: California requires nonprofit organizations...

The video, which appears to show Biden playing a controversial song by the rap group N.W.A. during a campaign trip to Florida, was labeled as manipulated media by Twitter, but it continued to circulate widely. In the original video, Biden pulls out his cellphone and plays...

They knew a lot, worked hard, and sometimes held your life in their hands. And because of this they were well compensated. Today, pharmacists are being turned into glorified Amazon pickers.

Driving the news: The American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group, will send a letter today warning Republican lawmakers and staffers to be aware of third-party lobbyists who receive funding from Big Tech in an attempt to "influence public policy on the Right" and "coopt the Republican party." Why it matters: Third-party influence is a key lobbying strategy for major companies in Washington and has in the past been very effective for Silicon Valley. Now it's becoming a...
__label__1 Oklahoma is preparing to defy its parole board and kill Julius JonesJust hours before the scheduled execution of Julius Jones, a 41-year-old Black man convicted of a murder he says he didn’t commit, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt still hasn’t said whether he’ll commute the death sentence, as activists have urged. Jones was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2002 for the murder of Oklahoma businessman Paul Howell. Jones, who has always maintained his innocence, and his supporters have pointed to deep flaws in the trial as reason for Stitt, a Republican, to commute his sentence to life in prison.  Specifically, they point to Jones’ defense...
__label__5 China’s Vain Struggle For Covid ZeroOPINIONIn pursuit of the mythical Covid zero, China is now pushing vaccines on children as young as three years old. Thus far, China has administered more than 2.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines—almost three times more than India, the country that has doled out the second most Covid jabs. More than 70 percent of China’s 1.4 billion population is fully vaccinated. China’s two most widely used Covid-19 vaccines, the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, were approved for use in children from ages three to 17 over the summer; however, China has been somewhat hesitant to vaccinate children...

Have you been to your local grocery store? Minimum wage workers who have kept food on our tables have been called "frontline heroes" – and yet when the chance arose to increase their wage to $15 an hour, the proposal was voted down. And the vote was not just along party lines – eight Democrats joined Republicans in rebuffing the bill. These votes are influenced by the massive power that special interests have over...
__label__2 Arizona’s Horrifying Plan to Bring Back the Gas ChamberOPINIONLate last month, Americans learned of the latest twist in the efforts of death penalty states to keep their execution machinery running when the Guardian revealed Arizona’s plan to revive the gas chamber. This news followed on the heels of continuing moves by the state’s Republican officeholders to resume putting inmates to death after a seven-year hiatus. Arizona stopped executions after the botched lethal injection of Joseph Wood in 2014. Wood died after two hours during which time he was injected with a total of 750 mg of midazolam and hydromorphone, 15 times the amount specified...

It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__3 Mike Pompeo pours cash into new PAC bearing his sloganFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is pouring money into a new political group amid speculation about a possible 2024 presidential run, records show. Why it matters: Champion American Values, formed in February, is the same phrase that Pompeo has been using lately including during remarks last month to an influential group of Republicans in Iowa, seen as a clear sign he's considering a 2024 bid. Between the lines: Pompeo hasn't officially declared his affiliation with the new PAC. But in records posted Thursday, his still-active House campaign committee reported...

Many virtue signalers and preeners like to cast themselves as brave, and to be lauded for their "courage." Kantor actually deserves such approbation, in this case. He knows that the CCP has zero tolerance for dissent, and has used its economic muscles to silence and punish critics, bending Western institutions –...
__label__3 ‘Dark money’ topped $1 billion in 2020, largely boosting DemocratsThe 2020 election saw more than $1 billion in “dark money” spending at the federal level, a massive sum driven by an explosion of secret donations boosting Democrats in a historically expensive cycle.  That’s according to an estimate from OpenSecrets. The billion-dollar sum includes a whopping $660 million in donations from opaque political nonprofits and shell companies to outside groups. In 2020, dark money groups preferred to bankroll closely-tied super PACs rather than spend the money themselves — politically active nonprofits that do not disclose their donors reported roughly...
__label__2 Trump Is Leaving the White House. Meanwhile, He’s Escalating His Execution Spree.ANALYSISLast week, as President Donald Trump was mounting more meritless court challenges to the election he had clearly lost, Orlando Hall was executed at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The day after his execution, which was the first carried out by a lame duck president in more than a century, the administration announced that it would be doubling down on its killing spree: Another three inmates would be executed in the weeks leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, bringing the total number of inmates scheduled to die...

Last December, that private equity fund, Hillhouse China Value Fund L.P., purchased a 6 percent stake in LONGi Green Energy, a Chinese solar panel manufacturer, making it the company’s second largest shareholder.

Christopher Vialva, 40, was pronounced dead shortly before 7 p.m. EDT after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. In a last statement, Vialva asked God to comfort the families of the couple he had killed, saying, “Father … heal their hearts with grace and love.” His final words were: “I’m ready, Father.”

__label__3 Why corporations are rethinking political donationsBig banks, big tech, and other major companies are pausing political contributions, primarily to Republicans, after election results were challenged. But Sen. Rick Scott has special reason for concern. Dear reader:  My first inkling of trouble for Republicans came Sunday with this headline: “Marriott suspends donations to senators who opposed vote result.”  The hotel chain wasn’t alone.

__label__1 'Man Down!': Inside the Deadly COVID-19 Outbreak at San QuentinThe frantic cries rang out across the cellblock: “Man down! Man down! Man down!” At California’s San Quentin State Prison, that’s the call prisoners use to alert staff about a life-or-death emergency. In June and July, with the coronavirus tearing through the prison, it became a grimly familiar chorus. Each incident would trigger alarm bells and corrections officers rushing in to remove critically ill men from their cells. Nowhere was the outbreak worse than San Quentin’s death row, home to more than 700 condemned men, more than any prison in...

__label__3 Trump Megadonor Sheldon Adelson Has Given At Least $180 Million This Year, Despite Troubles At His CompanyBillionaire Las Vegas Sands chairman and chief executive Sheldon Adelson has a catchphrase he likes to say during his company’s quarterly earnings calls: “Yay, dividends!” However, Adelson hasn’t been able to use that favorite phrase since January, weeks before the Covid-19 pandemic brought his gaming and resort empire to a grinding halt. For most people, even billionaires, cutting off a major cash spigot might force them to cut back on extraneous expenses, like political donations. But not Adelson. The 87-year-old casino tycoon, who is worth roughly $31.8 billion, has stockpiled...
__label__2 The Supreme Court finally struck down Oregon and Louisiana’s constitutional gamble — here’s what happens nextUntil recently, two US states did not require a unanimous jury verdict to convict defendants at felony criminal trials: Louisiana and Oregon. In both, a “supermajority” — meaning only 10 or more jurors out of 12 voting guilty — was sufficient to secure a conviction and a long sentence behind bars. Voters in Louisiana, a highly conservative state with the second-most prisoners in the nation, eschewed that system in favor of unanimity by ballot initiative in 2018. Oregon, despite its false reputation as a peaceable hippie paradise, was the stubborn...

__label__5 DNI Declassifies Handwritten Notes From John Brennan, 2016 CIA Referral On Clinton Campaign’s Collusion OperationTop U.S. intelligence officials were so concerned heading into the 2016 election that the Russians were aware of and potentially manipulating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s plans to smear Donald Trump as a Russian agent that they personally briefed President Barack Obama on the matter, newly declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) documents show. CIA officials also requested that the FBI investigate Russian knowledge of the Clinton campaign’s collusion smear operation. Newly declassified handwritten notes from former CIA Director John Brennan show that the U.S. intelligence community knew in 2016 that...

__label__3 What's behind Trump’s push for ‘patriotic education’?President Trump last week said his administration would be taking action to promote a “pro-American curriculum” in U.S. schools in an effort to counteract what he called “left-wing indoctrination” in education.  Speaking at the National Archives Museum, Trump said he intends to sign an executive order to create the “1776 Commission” to encourage schools to teach a positive view of American history. The commission’s name appears to be a dig at the 1619 Project, a series of essays published last summer by the New York Times Magazine that argue...

Why Should We Trust Government Privacy and Security Proposals?ANALYSISWe are often told that law enforcement must have a way to get around strong encryption technologies in order to catch bad guys. Such a "backdoor" into security techniques would only be used when necessary and would be closely guarded so it would not fall into the wrong hands, the story goes. The intelligence community does not yet have a known custom-built backdoor into encryption. But intelligence agencies do hold a trove of publicly unknown vulnerabilities, called "zero days," they use to obtain hard-to-get data. One would hope that government...

Nor did she really understand it two years later, when a jury sentenced her father’s killer, William Morva, to death. But as Mr. Morva’s lawyers periodically appealed the verdict over the next decade, his impending death became a recurring source of anxiety in Ms. Sutphin’s life. By the time she was in high school, Ms. Sutphin had...

The decision stands in contrast to two other moves by the administration favoring the release of potentially sensitive but historically important tranches of documents held in the governments’ archives, surrounding Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, and the attacks of September 11, 2001. The administration cited concerns raised by the Archivist of the United States that the pandemic...

Was there ever a time when Americans had unquestioning faith in federal law-enforcement agencies? Maybe in the days before Vietnam and Watergate, most citizens did believe that those in charge of the nation’s fate could be trusted. Before World War II, the FBI’s formidable public-relations machine actually produced a popular radio and television program lauding its efforts “in peace and war.” After the war, when the CIA became the country’s first full-time foreign-intelligence agency, few Americans understood much about what it was doing, and...

Some senior officials inside the CIA and the Trump administration even discussed killing Assange, going so far as to request “sketches” or “options” for how to assassinate him. Discussions over kidnapping or killing Assange occurred “at the highest levels” of the Trump administration, said a former senior counterintelligence official. “There...

While the executions were originally scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020, a legal battle delayed the execution process. These long litigation periods are quite common, with the average prisoner being held on death row for 20 years and 3 months before execution is carried out. However, a recent Supreme Court ruling has cleared the way for federal executions to resume. Before this,...

It "is another strong addition to AFPI’s already impressive arsenal of weapons against these assaults on our freedoms," institute President and CEO Brooke Rollins told the Washington Examiner. "Federalism, free speech, and the rule of law are...

__label__3 Prominent Left-Wing Prosecutors Endorse Biden’s Nominee To Lead Civil Rights OfficeKristen Clarke, the nominee to lead the Justice Department’s civil rights division, received endorsements from several big city prosecutors who are under fire over their soft-on-crime policies, according to a letter released ahead of her confirmation hearing this week. “The Civil Rights Division must take on great importance during the Biden Administration,” reads the letter, signed by 16 prosecutors. They noted that Clarke, who serves as president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, would be the first black woman to lead the civil rights division.
__label__2 Joe Biden and Xi Jinping: What they want from talksUS President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold a virtual summit on Monday as tensions between the countries deepen. The competing superpowers surprised many last week by issuing a joint declaration to address climate change, at talks in Glasgow, Scotland. But growing concerns of a military confrontation over Taiwan have thrown their differences into sharp relief. The pair's third meeting will address several thorny topics. Cybersecurity, trade and nuclear non-proliferation are subjects on the table, sources familiar with the negotiations told US media. In a statement released...

__label__3 Biden Administration Deploys the Civil Rights Act To Stop a $7 Billion Highway Project in HoustonANALYSISThe $7 billion Houston project—funded with a mix of state and federal dollars—would reroute I-45 near the city's downtown, add four managed express lanes to the highway, raise bridges, improve drainage to prevent flooding, and add bike lanes and pedestrian sidewalks at a number of cross streets. In order to add those express lanes, however, TxDOT is planning to widen the highway by as much as 220 feet in some places. The road's expanded footprint will result in the displacement of about 600 private homes, 486 units of public or...
__label__2 The future of the big new climate coalitionsSome of the most headline-grabbing initiatives to emerge from COP26 come with big questions about how — and if — they'll make the journey from promises to reality. Driving the news: COP26 brought the arrival or expansion of coalitions of nations making voluntary pledges around phasing out coal, cutting methane emissions, electric car growth, ending deforestation, curbing overseas fossil fuel finance and plenty more. While many of the biggest fossil fuel producers and users are missing from the deals, these ad-hoc agreements are still significant — if implemented. Yes, but: They're outside the official Paris agreement process, which requires formal,...
__label__4 Ex-C.I.A. Officer Suspected of Compromising Chinese Informants Is ArrestedA former C.I.A. officer suspected by investigators of helping China dismantle United States spying operations and identify informants has been arrested, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. The collapse of the spy network was one of the American government’s worst intelligence failures in recent years.
__label__3 US Condemns China at UN Rights Forum for Abuse of Uyghurs, TibetansThe United States on Friday condemned China’s abuse of ethnic and religious minorities, including what it called “crimes against humanity and genocide” in Xinjiang against Muslim Uyghurs and severe restrictions in Tibet. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who meets his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Alaska next week, is due to raise the treatment of Uyghurs, U.S. officials have said. China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against Uyghur and other Muslims in the remote western region, where activists say more than 1 million are held in...
__label__1 China's Xi Jinping cements his status with historic resolutionThe Chinese Communist Party has passed a "historical resolution", cementing Xi Jinping's status in political history. The document, a summary of the party's 100-year history, addresses its key achievements and future directions. It is only the third of its kind since the founding of the party - the first was passed by Mao Zedong in 1945 and the second by Deng Xiaoping in 1981. It was passed on Thursday at the sixth plenary session, one of China's most important political meetings. As only the third Chinese leader to have issued...
__label__4 2 Men Convicted of Killing Malcolm X Will Be Exonerated Decades LaterTwo of the men found guilty of the assassination of Malcolm X are expected to have their convictions thrown out on Thursday, the Manhattan district attorney and lawyers for the two men said, rewriting the official history of one of the most notorious murders of the civil rights era. The exoneration of the two men, Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam, represents a remarkable acknowledgment of grave errors made in a case of towering importance: the 1965 murder of one of America’s most influential Black leaders in the fight against...
__label__3 Cancel ‘Cancel Culture’ by Protecting ‘Political Ideology’ in Civil Rights LawsOPINION“Are you now, or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” That question brought dread and fear to countless Americans during the dark days of the “Hollywood Blacklist,” “McCarthyism” and the “Second Red Scare” of the early 1950s. The consequences of wrong thinking about politics seventy years ago could be dire. When the likes of Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy urged the private sector to root out communists, a moral panic was ignited, during which those deemed to have communist sympathies were rendered unemployable—not because of any criminality...
__label__2 U.S. and China unveil deal to ramp up cooperation on climate changeThe United States and China, the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, unveiled a deal to ramp up cooperation tackling climate change, including by reducing methane emissions, protecting forests and phasing out coal. The framework agreement was announced by U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the U.N. climate conference in Scotland, and was billed by both as way to tip the summit toward success. read more "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elements which will promote ambition," Kerry told a...
__label__5 Civil Rights Groups to Biden: Abolish Filibuster to Protect Voting RightsIn a CNN town hall on Wednesday, President Joe Biden called the wave of new laws restricting voting access “Jim Crow on steroids.” Despite that, he made clear he was not in favor of abolishing the filibuster—a relic of Jim Crow—in order to pass federal legislation that would counter GOP voter suppression efforts. Biden said in Cincinnati it would “throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done” if Senate Democrats scrapped the 60-vote requirement to pass voting rights bills. “I want to make sure we bring along not just all the...
__label__3 Are Guantanamo Prisoners Getting COVID Vaccines Before American Citizens?FACT CHECKA viral tweet from Charlie Kirk claimed that under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus vaccination distribution plan, “terrorists in Guantanamo Bay would be receiving [the vaccine] before a vast majority of American citizens.” The New York Times reported last week that the Pentagon would soon administer the coronavirus vaccine to all personnel at the Guantanamo facility. As a part of this plan, the vaccine would also “be offered to all detainees and prisoners.” With 31,123,299 vaccines administered in the United States as of January 31, Kirk is correct that this would...
__label__2 China's business crackdown isn't scaring away big investors"I can't and won't quit China." That was a prominent U.S. growth equity investor, when I asked if Beijing's business crackdown was causing him to reconsider his firm's China strategy. Driving the news: It's the same message I've heard repeatedly over the past 24 hours, albeit not usually so pithy. My questions came after SoftBank reported a $3.5 billion third-quarter loss, plus a $54 billion dip in net asset value, that it largely pinned on China. SoftBank CEO Masa Son began his investor presentation with a picture of a blizzard. Then, when explaining...
__label__5 Once a Bastion of Free Speech, the A.C.L.U. Faces an Identity CrisisIt was supposed to be the celebration of a grand career, as the American Civil Liberties Union presented a prestigious award to the longtime lawyer David Goldberger. He had argued one of its most famous cases, defending the free speech rights of Nazis in the 1970s to march in Skokie, Ill., home to many Holocaust survivors. Mr. Goldberger, now 79, adored the A.C.L.U. But at his celebratory luncheon in 2017, he listened to one speaker after another and felt a growing unease. A law professor argued that the free speech...
__label__3 The Failure of Black Lives MatterANALYSISBLM's anti-police rallying cry was the dumbest, most self-destructive slogan in American politics in a very long time. Black Lives Matter came up with the single most effective political slogan of the year. While no one was likely to be overly impressed with Joe Biden’s line, “Build Back Better,” and Donald Trump’s “Keep America Great” or “Make America Great Again, Again” didn’t have the resonance of the original 2016 version, BLM broke through the clutter with a catchphrase that was memorable, pungent — and utterly devastating to Democrats. After a...
__label__1 Will China’s energy crisis dampen its effort to cut emissions?China will play a key role in whether the world can curb global warming. But it’s also an industrial powerhouse, and recent electricity shortages reveal challenges ahead in balancing economic and environmental goals. Liu Rui, a university student in Tonghua, a city in Jilin province, felt anxious. A sudden, widespread power outage across northeastern China had left her family without electricity to cook or heat water, and her laptop’s battery was running out before an online class. “I was always worried the internet would suddenly disconnect during class,” says Ms....
__label__4 Georgia NAACP and voting rights groups challenge sweeping Georgia voting lawThe Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations on Monday filed a lawsuit to block a sweeping new law in Georgia that imposes new restrictions on voting, the latest in a slew of legal battles expected to take aim at the measure. The suit was filed in the federal district court in Atlanta just days after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the GOP-backed measure into law. The law is the first to usher in new changes to voting procedures following the 2020 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump...
__label__3 Face facts: ‘Black Lives Matter’ is all about hateOPINIONIts agenda is plain for all to see: cop-killing With another two police officers shot at the Black Lives Matter riot in Louisville on Wednesday, it’s time to lift the veil on the whole movement: It’s a haven for unrepentant cop-killers. These aren’t isolated incidents. It has been fewer than two weeks since supposedly “peaceful” BLM radicals chanted, “We hope they die,” while blocking the entrance to a hospital where two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies were undergoing life-saving surgery. An assailant had walked up to their patrol vehicle and...
__label__1 Blinken and Wang warn against fuelling Taiwan tensionsU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi locked horns over Taiwan on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit on Sunday, trading warnings against moves that could further escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait. In an hour-long meeting in Rome, Blinken made “crystal clear” that Washington opposes any unilateral changes by Beijing to the status quo around Taiwan, a senior State Department official said. A recent increase in Chinese military exercises in Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, including what Taipei said were eight such...
__label__5 Why Biden Fired Trump’s Appointee to a Key Civil Rights JobOPINIONIn his latest attempt to prevent the remnants of the Trump administration from choking his own agenda, President Joe Biden fired Sharon Gustafson, general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, on Friday. Biden had previously requested Gustafson’s resignation, but she refused to step down. Instead, she accused the president of targeting her because of her support for religious liberty. Republicans have rallied behind Gustafson, echoing her accusation that Biden violated norms in a malicious or even discriminatory manner. This narrative is curious for several reasons: First, by tradition, the...
__label__3 NSA Ruling Reminds Us That Sacrificing Civil Liberties in the Name of National Security Is a Bipartisan ImpulseANALYSISThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit yesterday ruled that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records was illegal and probably unconstitutional. For Democrats who see Donald Trump as an unprecedented threat because of his disregard for the Constitution, the decision is a useful reminder that sacrificing civil liberties on the altar of national security is a bipartisan rite. The NSA program, which was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, indiscriminately collected telephone "metadata"—indicating who was calling whom and how long they...
__label__2 US intel doesn’t expect to determine origins of COVID-19Barring an unforeseen breakthrough, intelligence agencies won’t be able to conclude whether COVID-19 spread by animal-to-human transmission or leaked from a lab, officials said Friday in releasing a fuller version of their review into the origins of the pandemic. The paper issued by the Director of National Intelligence elaborates on findings released in August of a 90-day review ordered by President Joe Biden. That review said that U.S. intelligence agencies were divided on the origins of the virus but that analysts do not believe the virus was developed as a bioweapon and that most agencies...
__label__5 Marjorie Taylor Greene Put A Transphobic Sign On Her Office Door To Taunt Her Colleague, ApparentlyANALYSISAs the House of Representatives prepares to vote on the Equality Act today, which offers much needed legislative protections for the LGBTQ+ community, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene decided that it would be a good time to post a transphobic sign outside of her office. After the House debate on the bill — during which Greene called the Equality Act "disgusting, immoral, and evil" — Illinois Rep. Marie Newman, a freshman Democrat from Illinois, raised a transgender pride flag outside of her office to signal support for the proposed...
__label__3 The pushback in Chicago as blacks grow sick and tired of looters and anarchistsOPINIONThe police have been scorned, demonized, despised and depleted by the woke crowd calling the shots in New York City. Lawlessness, homelessness and hopelessness once again threaten to transform this town into an open-air restroom by day, with mayhem and shootings reigning by night. There is, however, something we can do to stop what seems to be an inevitable slide into the abyss. New Yorkers must band ­together and fight the madness, like the good citizens of the city of Chicago. They’re mad as hell about the politician-endorsed chaos infesting...
__label__1 LinkedIn to shut down app in China following censorship controversyLinkedIn on Thursday said it will sunset the localized version of its app in China and will instead launch a new job boards app called "InJobs" later this year. Why it matters: In a statement, the company said it's making these changes because it's facing "a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China." Catch up quick: The news comes weeks after Axios China Reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian reported that LinkedIn blocked the profiles of several U.S. journalists from the company's China-based platform, citing "prohibited content." Allen-Ebrahimian posed questions to the tech giant about the...

Their victories are in peril. I. To My Mother you were born on July 9, 1964, in Greenwood, Mississippi, delivered into the cradle of white supremacy. Listening to the stories of terror and hope woven into the story of your birth used to frighten me. The year before you entered the world, white supremacists were blocking food aid to Greenwood, trying to starve Black sharecroppers who were demanding their civil rights. You were carried home in the...
__label__3 How the Chinese Communist Party Has Botched Its Xinjiang CoverupANALYSISShocking drone video footage of blindfolded Uighur prisoners being herded onto trains went viral this past week. The clip, which originally surfaced in September 2019 and which analysts confirmed was filmed in China’s Xinjiang region, has elicited comparisons to the Holocaust and calls to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Similarly eerie incidents abound. On July 1, 2020, U.S. customs agents seized a 13-ton shipment of beauty products made of human hair that originated in Xinjiang. As evidence of the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct increasingly seems to meet the...
__label__1 WHO names new advisory group on COVID originsThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday named 26 scientists to a new advisory board that will study the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Why it matters: Without a shift in attitude from Beijing, the new panel isn't likely to succeed in determining how this pandemic began. But it should be in a position to create a clearer picture of how to identify where new diseases like COVID-19 come from. The scientists were vetted for conflicts of interest and have more expertise on laboratory biorisks, which can help to study one hypothesis that the...
__label__4 A Federal Domestic Terrorism Law Could Threaten Civil Rights Groups Like BLMIn the wake of the insurrection on the nation’s Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden did not hesitate to refer to the far-right extremists who perpetrated the attack as domestic terrorists. "They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists,” Biden said. “It's that basic. It's that simple.” This is no light claim to make. Although US law defines domestic terrorism, it’s not a distinct crime that you can be charged with. That could change, as even before the attacks, Biden's transition team urged the...
__label__3 The Revolution Is WinningOPINIONThis is what the revolution looks like. Weather Underground terrorists, who made no secret of being anti-AmeriKKKan “small-c” communists, are having more success than they could have dreamed of in the 1960s. They are dominating the language. You know that whole “white privilege” nostrum that we’re paying universities $60K per year to drum into our children’s brains? It is derived from their lamentation of “white skin privilege.” In their ideology, the revolution to overthrow the capitalist, racist, imperialist system summoned them — lily white radicals — to abandon their privilege...
__label__2 Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?FACT CHECKChina says it has provided more than half of all the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured globally. We've looked into this and found that the answer isn't as straightforward as you might think. A video posted on social media by the Chinese Communist Party's youth league claims that over half the world's vaccines have come from China. It was posted on Weibo - the Chinese version of Twitter - at the end of September, just as the number of Covid vaccines administered globally had passed six billion (according to the website Our World...
__label__5 Betsy DeVos’ Legacy: Transforming How The Education Department Treats Civil RightsThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has spent months failing to make meaningful progress on urgent complaints of education discrimination relating to COVID-19, even as the pandemic continues to turn schools upside down and put vulnerable students at an even further disadvantage, according to multiple sources.  In September, employees in at least some of the department’s regional offices were informed that civil rights complaints specific to COVID-19 ― such as for children who have not been receiving accommodations for their disability during remote learning ― would...
__label__3 Disney Cruise Line to require children 5 and up to be vaccinated against COVID-19Children who set sail on Disney cruise ships will soon have to be vaccinated against COVID-19. All Disney Cruise Line guests ages five and over will be required to show proof of vaccination as of Jan. 13 on national and international trips, the company announced Wednesday. Kids younger than five will have to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken in the days before they board the ship. The cruise line currently requires that children 12 and over be inoculated. Disney had docked its cruise ships through the summer over pandemic concerns.
__label__1 China’s Power Shortfalls Begin to Ripple Around the WorldANALYSISChina is struggling with widespread power shortfalls, dealing a blow to the recovery of the second-largest economy and risking disruption to global supply chains and heightened inflationary pressure around the world. The power crunch, on a scale unseen in more than a decade, highlights how some of Beijing’s changing policy priorities, including its effort to limit carbon emissions, can ripple through a global economy that has been reshaped by the pandemic. “There’ll be a cascading effect,” said Mike Beckham, Oklahoma-based co-founder and CEO of Simple Modern, which makes products such as...
__label__4 How to Build a Multiracial MovementOPINIONIn 2014, I was part of an activist organization that worked across various social issues—education equity, economic justice, labor rights, and environmental racism. We were hungry for a deeper structural understanding of relationships of power, and a strategy to transform those relationships. One afternoon, we met to discuss topics for future political education; we were holding webinars to, in part, encourage people to join the organization. Three African Americans, two Latinas, one white man, and one Asian man sat around the table. As we discussed political education, I suggested that...

__label__1 Milley defends calls to Chinese at end of Trump presidencyThe top U.S. military officer told Congress on Tuesday that he knew former President Donald Trump wasn’t planning to attack China and that it was his job to reassure the Chinese of that fact in phone calls that have triggered outrage from some lawmakers. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered a full-throated defense of two calls he made to his Chinese counterpart, saying he was responding to “concerning intelligence” that China was worried about a U.S. attack. “I know, I am certain, that President...
__label__4 Trump’s Shredding of Civil Liberties Won’t Stop With AntifaOPINIONAn American was killed by federal agents and the president called it “retribution.” We are so far gone. There is still a lot we don’t know about the killing, early this month, of Michael Forest Reinoehl. Reinoehl, a self-described antifa supporter, was a suspect in the shooting of Aaron J. Danielson, a backer of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, during an August street confrontation in Portland, Ore. Prosecutors charged him with murder. Reinoehl, speaking to Vice News, said he acted in self-defense. There will be no trial to sort out...
__label__3 CDC: No Record of Naturally Immune Transmitting COVID-19The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that it has no record of people who are naturally immune transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. In the fall, the CDC received a request from an attorney on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network for documents “reflecting any documented case of an individual who: (1) never received a COVID-19 vaccine; (2) was infected with COVID-19 once, recovered, and then later became infected again; and (3) transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to another person when reinfected.” SARS-CoV-2 is another name for the CCP (Chinese Communist...
__label__2 China power crunch spreads, shutting factories and dimming growth outlookWidening power shortages in China have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying Apple and Tesla, while some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted. China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage. Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since...
__label__5 What Trump has done to the Justice Department's civil rights division is a disgraceOPINIONWhen Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 63 years ago, legendary Harlem Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. called it "the second emancipation." The law was the first major civil rights legislation since Reconstruction and helped build the foundational infrastructure for all future civil rights enforcement. Most importantly, it created the civil rights division within the Department of Justice — a division that quickly became a cornerstone for the entire civil rights movement (and the place where I started off my legal career). In the division's earliest days,...
__label__3 Why COVID-19 is spiking in highly vaccinated statesANALYSISThe coronavirus pandemic is still going. And as we head into the winter months, there are a number of questions about what might happen in states with high vaccination rates and mitigation measures. Some highly vaccinated states have seen massive coronavirus surges as of late, which might be a sign of what’s to come in the pandemic, according to Yahoo! News. What happens to the infected people in the upcoming days and weeks may be a signal of what to expect this winter and beyond. “The question now is whether above-average vaccination coverage and...
__label__1 China vows end to building coal-fired power plants abroadChinese President Xi Jinping told the UN General Assembly Tuesday that his country "will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad" and plans to boost support for clean energy in developing nations. Why it matters: The pledge, if maintained, would mark a breakthrough in efforts to transition global power away from the most carbon-emitting fuel. Nations, including the U.S., have been urging China — historically a key source of coal-plant finance — to make such a commitment. Xi's pledge on coal financing comes just weeks before a critical UN climate summit....

VERDICT: WTF is he talking about? As of this week, almost 350,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Biden's watch at an average rate of 1,172 per day. That is more than the combined total of American combat deaths in the First and Second World Wars. It is the...
__label__1 Stock Market Pares Losses, but Dow, S&P 500 Fall Nearly 2%Worries about spreading contagion from troubles in China’s property market sent U.S. stocks toward their steepest declines in months on Monday.Losses for the major U.S. indexes accelerated midday, then reversed in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.8%, around 614 points, dragged down by shares of Caterpillar and financial heavyweights like Goldman Sachs . The S&P 500 dropped 1.7%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.2%, after being down more than 3% earlier in the afternoon.
__label__4 Understanding my Privilege by Learning South-Asian American HistoryOPINIONIn the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s easy to continue seeing the United States of America as just Black and white. Here’s why it’s important for South Asians in the U.S. to become good stewards of their own unique history in this historic moment.  “You didn’t make good choices. You had good choices.” Mia Warren says this to co-protagonist Elena Richardson about halfway through the Hulu series “Little Fires Everywhere.” Although this story was set in the 1990s and this line is directed at a white...
__label__3 Regulator Reviewing Reports of ‘Rare’ and Serious Condition Linked to Moderna VaccineEurope’s drug regulator on Thursday confirmed it is investigating reports of a blood condition in recipients of Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. According to a bulletin posted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), it is reviewing six cases of capillary leak syndrome, considered a “very rare disorder,” after they were reported in the EMA’s EudraVigilance database. “At this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association between vaccination and the reports of capillary leak syndrome,” the EMA wrote on Thursday, adding that “these reports point to a safety signal … information on new,...
__label__2 Biden to stress U.S. does not seek new Cold War in UN speechPresident Biden will use his first address before the UN General Assembly to lay out his vision for an era of "intensive diplomacy" with allies and "vigorous competition" with great powers — without a Cold War with China. Why it matters: Biden will take the podium in New York on Tuesday with his own international credibility in question after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. His administration also is struggling to build international momentum to fight climate change, the pandemic and rising global authoritarianism. What they're saying: Biden's speech "will center on the...
__label__4 Elizabeth Warren Wants To Know Why This Company Was Spying On BLM ProtestersFour lawmakers, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said Tuesday that they have "serious concerns" about data-mining company Mobilewalla following a BuzzFeed News story in June that showed the company had used cellphone location data to predict the race, age, gender, and home location of more than 17,000 Black Lives Matter protesters. In a letter sent Tuesday to Mobilewalla CEO Anindya Datta, Warren, Sen. Ron Wyden, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, and House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chair Carolyn Maloney demanded more information about the data that the company collects and how...
__label__3 Senior NIH Doctor Pushes Back on COVID-19 Vaccine MandatesA top infectious disease doctor has raised alarm about COVID-19 vaccine mandates despite top federal officials recommending them for businesses, schools, and other institutions. Dr. Matthew Memoli, who runs a clinical studies unit within the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci—is scheduled to argue against COVID-19 vaccine mandates during a Dec. 1 seminar hosted by the agency, according to David Wendler, a senior NIH bioethicist who is planning the seminar. “There’s a lot of debate within the NIH about whether [a vaccine mandate] is...
__label__1 UN chief warns China, US to avoid Cold WarWarning of a potential new Cold War, the head of the United Nations implored China and the United States to repair their “completely dysfunctional” relationship before problems between the two large and deeply influential countries spill over even further into the rest of the planet. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to The Associated Press this weekend ahead of this week’s annual United Nations gathering of world leaders — a convening blemished by COVID, climate concerns and contentiousness across the planet. Guterres said the world’s two major economic powers should be...
__label__4 Democrats to introduce legislation to tighten DHS intel oversightMembers of Congress responsible for oversight of the Department of Homeland Security will introduce legislation strengthening its internal civil rights office, they announced Monday. The move comes after POLITICO reported that a top DHS official limited the ability of that office to oversee the work of the department’s intelligence arm. Several months ago, the department’s second-in-command constrained the ability of DHS’ Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) to review intelligence products from the department’s Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A). After making that change, I&A released intelligence reports...
__label__3 U.S. faces uneasy crossroads on COVID-19 before holidaysThe U.S. recovery from the crushing delta wave of the coronavirus is beginning to stall out, with case counts stuck around 70,000 per day for two weeks after a precipitous decline from the peak of the Sun Belt surge in September. A drop in hospitalizations, a key metric as people begin to “live with” the virus and vaccinated persons fend off breakthrough infections, also appears to be slowing around the 45,000 mark. The Mountain West is seeing some of the biggest surges, with states like Montana and Wyoming accounting for...
__label__1 U.S. and China Reach Deal to Block Myanmar’s Junta From U.N.The United States and China have brokered an agreement that will effectively block Myanmar’s military rulers from addressing the United Nations’ General Assembly next week, according to diplomats, dealing a blow to the junta’s quest for international legitimacy after it took power in a coup earlier this year.  But the pact—which was hammered out during weeks of behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations—will require Myanmar’s defiant, still-serving U.N. ambassador who represented the previous government to hold his tongue during the high-level event, refraining from the tough rhetoric he deployed last year in denouncing the...

__label__5 We’ve Neglected the Freedom of Assembly for Years Before PortlandANALYSISThe First Amendment prevents the government from doing a whole lot of things. We tend to focus on the freedom of speech, but the First Amendment also protects other, equally important freedoms, among them, “the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” The right to assemble, protest, and gather is the neglected younger sister to the free speech clause. As the Supreme Court lavishes attention on commercial speech and money as speech and religious signage and union dues and cake baking as speech, the freedom to gather and protest is...

The praise was well deserved. A broader context helps understand his true contribution.John Lewis was born one of 10 children of a sharecropper in Troy, Alabama. He should be remembered now as one of the founding fathers of American democracy. When he led that famous march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, America was not yet a full democracy.

When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...

__label__4 ‘Zero-Covid is not going to happen’: experts predict a steep rise in US cases this winterA steep rise in Covid-19 cases in Europe should serve as a warning that the US could also see significant increases in coronavirus cases this winter, particularly in the nation’s colder regions, scientists say. However, there is more cause for optimism as America enters its second pandemic winter, even in the face of likely rises in cases. Evidence shows vaccine-conferred protection against hospitalization and death remains high several months after inoculation, vaccines for children older than 5 can reduce Covid transmission, and new antiviral medications hold the promise of making...
__label__3 Vaccine or Bust: Biden Orders 84M Americans to Take the Jab - Will a Third of US Workers Quit?ANALYSISThe jab or your job? That's what 84-million Americans are facing after the Biden administration has finally, officially, released the President's vaccine mandate against private businesses. More than two dozen states are pushing back, and millions of employees say they'll lose their jobs rather than take the shot. But the message from the Biden Administration is vaccine or bust. The President is demanding that all businesses with more than 100 employees should force them to take a COVID-19 vaccine.  The order calls for businesses to either require vaccinations – or...

Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...

__label__4 No, Workers Aren’t Striking Because of Vaccine MandatesOPINIONThere’s a meme traveling around conservative media that vaccine mandates are the cause of the ongoing strike wave. Although you certainly can find news stories here and there about someone quitting due to a vaccine mandate or a small-scale labor protest (such as a slowdown or sickout) due to the vaccine mandate, it is clearly not the case that opposition to the vaccine mandate is driving the much bigger labor market developments. The real driver is labor market tightness. Quits Quit rates and levels tend to move in lockstep with...
__label__3 Here Are The Conservatives Suing Biden Over His ‘Unconstitutional’ Vaccine CoercionANALYSISAt least 19 states have already begun to legally pursue action against the Biden administration for forcing medical coercion on federal contractors but following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s new emergency temporary standard demanding employers with 100 or more workers mandate the jab, others are looking to sue too. OSHA’s explicit threat that the rule could eventually extend to smaller businesses in the near future has also pushed politicians, attorneys, and business owners to take legal action. Here are the conservatives who are suing Biden and his administration for forcing the COVID-19 jab...

For weeks, former CIA Director John Brennan has hinted that he believed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation would end with the indictment of President Trump or another member of the Trump family. He suggested as much during a recent appearance on MSNBC, in which host Lawrence O'Donnell desperately tried to convince his audience that Brennan knew something they didn't. Now that Attorney General William Barr has received Mueller's report, and is not considering charges...

The more than 7 billion shots administered so far are a massive, record-breaking public health achievement. But more than 50 countries have vaccinated less than 25 percent of their populations. Vaccines aren’t distributed equally: Rich countries have about twice the population of low-income countries, yet they have received about 50 times as many Covid-19 vaccine doses, according to an October report from the People’s Vaccine Alliance. The countries with the lowest incomes generally have the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates. This vaccination gap...

Schools in every state, after all, already mandate vaccines for a range of diseases. These mandates have a long history in the US, with some states requiring immunization in schools as early as the 19th century. One goal of the mandates is to stop the spread of potentially deadly diseases, but another is to prevent outbreaks from disrupting the classroom as kids get sick and stay home. Covid-19 has very much disrupted schools in the past...

The measure would send grants to local municipalities to hire more law enforcement officers as the country faces a rise in violent crime and a rash of officers quitting the force. “As you have recognized, putting 100,000 more officers on the beat is vitally important for public safety,” Mr. Hawley wrote...
__label__2 'Not Enough Time': Census Workers Fear Rushing Count Could Botch ResultsWith 50 days left to count every person living in the U.S., Census Bureau workers around the country are facing what many consider an increasingly impossible mission. Already hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, a shortened schedule for counting has exacerbated lingering challenges in dealing with health risks, retaining workers and deploying new technology for the 2020 census, which is now wrapping up in the middle of a historic hurricane season. "There's just not enough time to do all the work that needs to be done," one office operations supervisor tells...

By the time she was released, she “was very hungry and exhausted,” according to the letter.  The child, described only as N.B. in the...
__label__3 What Exactly Is Andrew Cuomo Guilty Of?OPINIONIn the 165-page report issued last week by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, there is a curious incongruity that few seem to have noticed in their furor to denounce Gov. Andrew Cuomo. (How many journalists bothered to read the report before commenting, one wonders?) While press accounts have near-uniformly declared the allegations set forth to be supremely “damning,” a closer examination of the report itself, as well as the peculiar surrounding details, leaves room for a bit more ambiguity. The report concludes that “under the totality of the...
__label__1 Trump’s new plan to hijack the census will imperil America’s futureANALYSISIf Donald Trump winds up as a one-term president—which current polling suggests will be the case—he seems determined to go out with a final blow in his war against the nation’s changing demography. This time, he has set his sights on the Census Bureau, as it struggles to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and complete its once-in-a-decade headcount that is vital to our democracy. Two weeks ago, the Trump administration issued a memorandum seeking to remove undocumented immigrants (“illegal aliens” in the memo’s words) from the census headcount...
__label__5 He Calls Himself the ‘American Sheriff.’ Whose Law Is He Following?ANALYSIS  The first thing to know about Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, is that he just plain looks like a sheriff. It could be the Justin cowboy hat he wears pulled low over his eyes and his penchant for Western shirts and a tactical vest in lieu of a uniform. It could be his demeanor, at once confident and aw-shucks. It could be his size — he’s 6’3”, 240 pounds, or so he writes in his self-published book, American Sheriff: Traditional Values in a Modern World. In public,...
__label__3 Seattle Mayor Proposes Rebuilding Depleted Police Force after Violent WeekendSeattle Mayor Jenny Durkan called to rebuild the city’s police force after the area recorded six separate shootings over the weekend. “As a city, we cannot continue on this current trajectory of losing police officers,” Durkan said during press conference on Monday. “Over the past 17 months, the Seattle Police Department has lost 250 police officers which is the equivalent of over 300,000 service hours. We’re on path to losing 300 police officers.”
__label__1 India Must Speak Up for Human Rights at UNSCOPINIONWhen India joins the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a non-permanent member in January 2021, it will confront a range of issues. How can the UN help wind down conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, while ensuring humanitarian aid for civilians and justice for wrongdoers? How can it protect refugees fleeing these and many other conflicts? How to address the human rights impact, including structural racism and inequality, of the coronavirus pandemic? Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres for his reluctance to rebuke powerful countries such...

Dawn Bancroft of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Jan. 29, a few weeks after she and her friend Diana Santos-Smith entered the Capitol during the riot. Bancroft, in a selfie video sent to a friend that was filmed as she and Santos-Smith...

Then police chief fires back with bodycam footage.Activists on social media sent alleged a viral video showed a Wisconsin police officer planting evidence inside a vehicle during a traffic stop last Wednesday. Now, the police department at the center of the allegations has released officer bodycam footage refuting the allegations. The short 14-second video shows an officer with the Village of Caledonia Police Department in Caledonia, Wisconsin, toss an item into the backseat of a vehicle that was allegedly pulled over for traveling 63 mph in a 45 mph zone. "Hey bro, what's that?" the passenger of...
__label__1 This City Stopped Sending Police to Every 911 CallOLYMPIA, Wash. — On a rainy June day, the manager of a Motel 6 outside Olympia decided one guest had to leave. The woman had been smoking indoors and had an unauthorized visitor. She appeared to be on drugs and was acting erratically. Normally, that manager might call 911, which would bring police officers to the scene. If the guest refused to leave, the cops might handcuff and arrest her for trespassing. They could find an open warrant on her record or drugs in her room. The interaction could easily...
__label__4 Murders are spiking. Police should be part of the solution.ANALYSISLast year, the US’s murder rate spiked by almost 30 percent. So far in 2021, murders are up nearly 10 percent in major cities. The 2020 increase alone is the largest percentage increase ever recorded in America — and a reversal from overall declines in murder rates since the 1990s. American policymakers now want answers on this surge. One approach has good evidence behind it: the police. There is solid evidence that more police officers and certain policing strategies reduce crime and violence. In a recent survey of criminal justice experts, a majority said...
__label__2 Federal Prosecutors Are Branding Non-Violent Jan 6 Defendants As ‘Terrorists’ To Pursue Harsher SentencesFederal prosecutors are attempting to pursue harsher sentences for those arrested for non-violent crimes in connection with the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by branding them as terrorists while acknowledging their actions don’t meet the legal definition of terrorism. Court documents first flagged by independent journalist Michael Tracey from the case of Paul Hodgkins, the first Jan. 6 rioter convicted of a felony to be sentenced, show U.S. Attorney Mona Sedky saying that “we are framing this in the context of domestic terrorism,” even though his actions do not meet any...
__label__1 Why do Black troops face a harsher form of military justice?Cultural shifts in the U.S. military have often served as a bellwether for larger social change. By taking on racism in its criminal justice system, the Pentagon might reveal ways to address broader injustice. Two years ago, the U.S. military decided to prosecute a Black service member for being six minutes late to a meeting, bringing his case to a court-martial hearing and, ultimately, a conviction. “That’s a decision that truly should not have been made,” retired Col. Don Christensen, who previously served as the Air Force’s chief prosecutor, told...
__label__5 Derek Chauvin Could Get His Conviction Reversed Because of This Cop’s CaseFormer Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was supposed to spend 12 and a half years in prison after he shot and killed an unarmed Australian woman who’d called 911 to report what she suspected to be a sexual assault.  But the Minnesota Supreme Court just reversed his murder conviction, the first in the state for a police officer—and the decision could end up overturning a murder change against another infamous officer as well: Derek Chauvin.  The state’s highest court ruled Wednesday that the third-degree murder charge against Noor in the shooting of Justine...
__label__3 Taxonomy Of Woke ReligionOPINIONHere’s a Shellenberger essay explaining why wokeism is a religion. He begins by pointing out how the devoutly woke believe things that are demonstrably untrue, but that are defended fanatically by the true believers. More: But just because an ideology is dogmatic and self-righteous does not necessarily make it a religion, and so it is fair to ask whether Wokeism is anything more than a new belief system. There is no obviously mythological or supernatural element to Woke ideology, and its adherents rarely, if ever, justify their statements with reference to...

__label__4 Cop Was Instructed to Use Music to Disrupt FilmingA police officer in Illinois was instructed to use music to disrupt an activist filming him, according to an incident report obtained by Motherboard. From Beverly Hills to Illinois, law enforcement officers are using “copyright hacking” in an attempt to prevent activists from posting videos of encounters to the internet. Over the past few months, some police have loudly broadcast copyrighted music when confronted by cameras. The logic is that the music should trigger recognition software used by platforms, and either prevent videos from being broadcast live on Instagram and YouTube or lead...
__label__3 Aaron Rodgers: I’m In The Crosshairs Of The Woke Mob Right NowGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers voiced his frustration over the media criticizing his medical choices. On Friday, Rodgers publicly addressed his stance on the vaccine after testing positive for the virus earlier in the week. “The situation I’m in should be a conversation, not a controversy,” said Rodgers. The player emphasized he isn’t anti-vaccine, but believes the vaccine isn’t in his best health interests after previously mentioning he was allergic to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines. Instead, the player claimed he took ivermectin to fight the virus.

They knew a lot, worked hard, and sometimes held your life in their hands. And because of this they were well compensated. Today, pharmacists are being turned into glorified Amazon pickers. All because of the expanding pharmacy monopoly.1 Matt Stoller has a rundown of a workers’ rights movement that has emerged in pharmacist world.

Ron DeSantis a win in his fight against White House virus rules. Lawmakers in GOP-controlled statehouse expedited the measure, along with a package of virus bills, after hours of debate in which Republicans maintained they were protecting workers from onerous mandates by the federal government. “If you want to get a vaccine, you can get a vaccine.

__label__4 Officer who shot Ashli Babbitt during Capitol riot breaks silence: 'I saved countless lives'In the chaotic minutes before he shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, Lt. Michael Byrd focused his attention on the glass doors leading into the lobby of the House of Representatives chamber. About 60 to 80 House members and staffers were holed up inside, and it was Byrd’s job to protect them. As rioters rampaged through the Capitol, Byrd and a few other officers of the U.S. Capitol Police set up a wall of furniture outside the doors. “Once we barricaded the doors, we were essentially trapped where we...
__label__3 Mayoral Candidates Turn Backs To Black Lives Matter Movement, Promise ‘Law And Order’Candidates running in Tuesday’s mayoral elections across the U.S. have promised to “crackdown” on crime in the aftermath of violent crime surges that swept through major American cities. Candidates, including Democrats, have stepped away from the Black Lives Matter movement’s calls to defund police departments in response to the death of George Floyd, as crime has risen in cities and the public demands for traditional policing strategies, according to the Washington Post. A Tuesday Pew Research poll revealed that 47% of Americans want to increase funding toward police departments, while 15% want to decrease funds....

But in many cases, those investments turned out to be doing more harm than good.Why it matters: In some cases, the efforts to keep kids and teachers safe in schools may not be as effective as claimed. In other cases, the air cleaning systems could be exposing them to the harmful toxins ozone and formaldehyde, experts warn.

__label__5 New Documents Show Pentagon Rubber-Stamping Police Requests For Military GearLast summer, as one city after another broke out in protest against the murder of George Floyd, some of the most enduring images were not of the demonstrators, but of the police: decked out in riot gear, aiming automatic weapons at peaceful crowds, and riding around on armored vehicles built for war. The crackdowns on protesters renewed furious demands to end a suite of federal programs that have put billions of dollars’ worth of military weapons in the hands of local police. President Joe Biden singled out the most infamous...
__label__3 Can Halloween survive the war on holidays?ANALYSISFirst came the war on Christmas, then the war on Columbus Day. Could Halloween be next? It’s already happening in some school districts, where administrators have deemed the beloved fall celebration inappropriate because it’s not inclusive enough. The latest school district to ditch Halloween was in Melrose, Massachusetts, a town about 7 miles north of Boston. There, Superintendent Julie Kukenberger wrote to parents that the school district wants to “deemphasize” Halloween in favor of “community building through fall celebrations,” according to Boston 25 News. “I am working in collaboration with...
__label__1 8 lingering questions about the new Covid pills from Merck and PfizerThe past two months have brought extremely good news in the fight against Covid-19. Two different oral treatments have proved effective at both preventing people newly diagnosed with Covid-19 from entering the hospital and from dying. “We’re accelerating our path out of this pandemic,” President Biden said after data on the second Covid pill became available. The wide availability of oral drugs could make Covid-19 less lethal, making it less risky for people to return to in-person work and to their normal lives. The first results, from Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics,...
__label__4 Can Biden Finish What Obama Started And Close Down Guantanamo?ANALYSISNineteen years after he was captured in Afghanistan, and five years after a review board ruled he posed no threat to the United States, Abdul Latif Nasser was finally released this month from the U.S. military prison complex at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and repatriated to his native Morocco. He became the first prisoner transferred from the notorious detention facility in more than three years. The move became the first real sign that there’s an effort underway to close Guantanamo. Since President Joe Biden came into office, however, administration officials at the Pentagon,...

It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__1 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...

Rittenhouse, who is now 18, has been charged as an adult with five felonies and is accused of crossing state lines and using a gun to kill Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, and injure Gaige Grosskreutz. Earlier this month, amid a swarm of controversy, he went on trial in a Kenosha courtroom.  The killings occurred in August 2020, during a series of protests that took place after Rusten Sheskey, a white Kenosha police officer, shot 27-year-old Jacob...

__label__2 When can kids take off their masks in school? Here's what some experts sayWhen can kids safely take off their masks in school? About three-fourths of the nation's largest districts required masks at the start of the school year. Recently the calls by some parents to unmask children have grown louder, especially now that there is a COVID-19 vaccine available with emergency authorization for children as young as 5 years old. The country is still in a pandemic that's killing more than 1,000 Americans every day. And a body of evidence shows masking, in combination with other safety measures, effectively cuts COVID-19 transmission in K-12 schools....
__label__4 America can’t fix policing without fixing the country’s gun problemOPINIONI started reporting this article with a simple question: What would it look like to build a better police department from the ground up? Police in the US, after all, are more likely to shoot and kill someone than their peers around the developed world, and disproportionately the victims are Black Americans. Meanwhile, serious crimes are often unsolved — with almost half of murders in 2020 going uncleared. So I asked a dozen experts, focused on criminal justice, what could be done about this to build better police departments. They gave me a lot of different answers,...

The retail giant confirmed to City Journal that it has been working with the Racial Equity Institute, a North Carolina company devoted to “creating racially equitable organizations.” Walmart said it has “engaged REI for a number of training sessions since 2018” and has “found these sessions to be thought-provoking and constructive.” City Journal’s Christopher...
__label__1 Can Colorado Hospitals Turn Away Unvaccinated Patients?FACT CHECKAn article from Red Voice Media, self-described as being owned by “patriots” and fighting “false narratives against conservatives,” claims that “Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) signed an executive order this week that allows hospitals to turn away those who are unvaccinated against COVID-19.”  According to the article, the executive order “makes it clear that it authorizes discrimination against those who are not vaccinated for COVID-19.” The claim has also been widely shared on Twitter, with one user generating thousands of likes and retweets saying that: “The dem governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, signed...
__label__5 More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report saysMore and more people are identifying as members of the LGBTQ community. Increased visibility educates non-LGBTQ people, but it also comes with a purported price, according to GLAAD's annual Accelerating Acceptance Study out Wednesday. The report found that 43% of non-LGBTQ people think gender is not exclusively male and female, up from 38% in 2020. And 81% of non-LGBTQ people anticipate nonbinary and transgender people will become as familiar in everyday life as gay and lesbian people have. "Our community continues to grow, and we're seeing some growing acceptance of that," says Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD CEO. "We...
__label__3 Football And America’s ReligionOPINIONLast night the Las Vegas Raiders forced out legendary football coach Jon Gruden after a slew of his private emails containing “homophobic” and “misogynistic” language were leaked. The story is the same as thousands that precede it. Gruden is just another scalp on the woke culture warriors’ walls. The New York Times is proud of their reporting that brought down the Super Bowl-winning coach. There’s nothing new to these cancellation tactics, and we’ll see the cackling hyenas in the left-wing press pursue more scalps in the near future. This story does, however, reveal the warped moral...

On Sept. 16, the student was told that his membership in the "oppressive" Federalist Society had "triggered" his peers. On Sept. 17, he was reminded that "there’s a bar you have to take." The meetings came in response to an email the student had sent inviting classmates to a happy hour at his "trap house," which elicited allegations that he was planning a blackface party.
__label__2 Moderna says Covid vaccine has fewer breakthrough cases than Pfizer’s, but higher myocarditis rates in young menModerna defended the use of its Covid-19 vaccine Thursday, saying the protection it offers against severe disease, hospitalization and death outweighs the risk of myocarditis, a rare heart condition seen in a small number of young men who received the shot. The company announced last week that the Food and Drug Administration needed more time to decide whether to authorize its two-dose vaccine for use in children ages 12 to 17 as the agency looks into reports of myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle. Reported cases of the rare heart inflammation...
__label__5 The Virginia Governor's Race Will Be The Latest Verdict In The Culture WarsOPINIONEver since the Unite the Right rally, in 2017, Virginia’s politics have been in flux. Is the state, like Charlottesville, a place under threat from reactionaries, or is it, also like Charlottesville, a place that has fought them back? This past week, two developments have pointed toward some resolution: a civil trial against the rally’s organizers began, and the city of Charlottesville released six proposals to take ownership of the Confederate monuments that drew the extremists in the first place. The Statuary Park at Gettysburg proposed displaying the monuments alongside...
__label__3 The New Victim of Cancel Culture: ScienceOPINIONCancel culture has reared its ugly head once again, and this time in a new and unprecedented way. A lecture by a physicist was canceled at one of America’s premier institutions of science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for reasons having nothing to do with the subject of the lecture. The lecture was canceled not because of its scientific content but because of the politically incorrect views on diversity of the scientist scheduled to give the lecture. Dorian Abbot is a professor in the department of the geophysical sciences at the...

COVID vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds began in earnest late last week, ramping up over the weekend and early this week. By the end of the day on Wednesday, about 900,000 elementary school-age children will have gotten their first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a White House official shared with NPR in advance of an announcement expected later in the day.

A hundred years after the United States adopted daylight savings time — a contrivance developed to extract maximum labor power from workers — we might indulge in some musings on how a different society would make time for workers. Our world prioritizes profit above all else, and, unless we are wealthy enough...

We tend to associate memory with wisdom, too. We remember the past—whether it be the good, the bad, or the ugly—in order to live wiser lives in the present. Thus, I was somewhat puzzled when I stumbled upon a piece by prominent historian Allen C. Guelzo, “Why We Must...

Biden announced last Thursday that his administration will enforce the vaccine mandates starting on Jan. 4. The rules apply to employers with at least 100 workers, federal contractors and employees of nursing homes and other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid government healthcare programs.

What Happened to Them?ANALYSISIt’s been a long time since I sat in an American history class, but what I remember of my education in Jacksonville, Florida, in the 1980s and ’90s is how much of it was not fact, but myth. I was taught that the Civil War was fought over states’ rights—a concept that seemed plausibly defensible to a kid—and that “our side” had its own heroes and its own stories worth remembering. Several of my relatives who live in north Florida still fly the Confederate flag on their boats and paste...
__label__3 A Different Approach to Anti-RacismANALYSISChloé Valdary had an unusual childhood. She grew up in a Christian family, but one that celebrated Jewish holy days. She was raised in New Orleans, a city dominated by Catholicism and its symbols, but her church was anti-Catholic. She's black, but her first steps into identity politics and activism were in opposition to antisemitism. And even with her religious upbringing, it was something an agnostic professor said that provoked her eureka moment. So it's perhaps unsurprising that her approach to anti-racism is different from that of best-selling leftist consultants...
__label__2 COMIC: If history is a guide, schools will start requiring COVID vaccinesANALYSISThe first time kids had to get a vaccine to go to school was more than 200 years ago. The disease? Smallpox. For the past four decades, all 50 U.S. states have required that parents, if they want to enroll their children in any school, public or private, must vaccinate them against contagious diseases like polio and measles. The reason is simple: High rates of vaccination dramatically cut deaths and have all but eliminated some diseases. But as long as there have been vaccines, there have been people who oppose them, formerly known as...
__label__4 Americans Are Overworked And Over WorkTiffany Chen had always wanted to be a clothing designer. When she was an undergraduate studying fashion at New York City’s Parsons School of Design, she dreamed of having her own clothing line. “I was like, ‘Oh, it'd be nice to have my own line someday and sell out Barneys,’” she said on a recent Tuesday morning over coffee at Mah-Ze-Dahr bakery in Greenwich Village. “[But] now that we saw what happened with Barneys, maybe it was a good thing it didn't work out that way.” The path seemed simple enough: She...
__label__3 Is the pro-life movement prepared to win?OPINIONAfter being given a huge nudge from the Supreme Court declining to block Texas’ new restrictions on abortion, the main topic of conversation in the pro-life movement today is the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned or weakened. When the court rules on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in the coming months, many in the movement are hopeful for a big legal win. But is the pro-life movement prepared to win? An important lesson Americans must learn from our history is that legal victories without accompanying...
__label__2 Republican-led states begin legal fight over Biden vaccine mandateMore than 15 states across the U.S. have filed lawsuits against the Biden administration over its federal vaccine mandate for companies with at least 100 employees. Driving the news: Attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday against the administration, calling the mandate "unconstitutional, unlawful and unwise." The states participating in the lawsuit are Missouri, Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, New Hampshire and Wyoming. The lawsuit was primarily brought by 10 Republican attorneys general. Iowa's Democratic attorney general, Tom Miller, also joined in the suit. State of play: On...
__label__4 'They start calling you Hitler': Why Disneyland has some of the most toxic fans on the internetOPINION“This has to stop,” a Disneyland fan said. There had been a stream of troubling comments for the past few days in the “Vintage Disneyland” Facebook group. People were getting offended, and others were starting to speak out. It started innocently, with people sharing memories of the park with the phrase “My Disneyland had …” My Disneyland had the Welch’s Grape Juice stand. My Disneyland let you fly through the Matterhorn on the Skyway.  But the internet being the internet, things took a dark turn, fast. “My Disneyland didn’t let wokeness...

__label__2 Covid: Pfizer says antiviral pill 89% effective in high risk casesAn experimental pill to treat Covid developed by the US company Pfizer cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adults, clinical trial results suggest. The drug - Paxlovid - is intended for use soon after symptoms develop in people at high risk of severe disease. It comes a day after the UK medicines regulator approved a similar treatment from Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD). Pfizer says it stopped trials early as the initial results were so positive. The UK has already ordered 250,000 courses of the new Pfizer...
__label__4 We’re Losing Our Humanity, and the Pandemic Is to BlameOPINIONKurt Thigpen clenched his hands around the edge of the table because if he couldn’t feel the sharp edges digging into his palms, he would have to think about how hard his heart was beating. He was grateful that his mask hid his expression. He hoped that no one could see him sweat. A woman approached the lectern in the center aisle, a thick American flag scarf looped around her neck. “Do you realize the mask, the CDC said it’s only 2% effective?” she demanded. “You’re failing our children, you’re...
__label__3 Marijuana Arrests Plunged Last Year, Reflecting the Impact of LegalizationLast year, according to data the FBI published this week, police in the United States made about 350,000 arrests for marijuana offenses, the lowest level recorded in three decades. The 36 percent drop in 2020, which follows an 18 percent decrease in 2019, reflects the impact of ballot initiatives and legislation that eliminated penalties for low-level possession last year or earlier. It may also reflect the impact of COVID-19 restrictions that drove cannabis consumers indoors, where they were less likely to be noticed by police. As usual, the vast majority of marijuana arrests in 2020 (91...
__label__2 Moderna Crash Wipes Out Another $24 Billion After Supply-Chain Issues Dent Covid Vaccine SalesModerna shares plummeted Thursday morning after the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech firm posted worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and warned sales of its Covid-19 vaccines would fail to meet previous projections, fueling pessimism among analysts that warning the stock’s meteoric gains would fail to hold up amid supply-chain constraints as the pandemic wanes. Shares of Moderna plunged 17% shortly after the market opened Thursday, wiping out more than $24 billion in market value and pushing prices to a three-month low of $287. Triggering the morning crash, Moderna on Thursday reported third-quarter sales and earnings that...
__label__5 Move over, Matthew and Beto: is Texas ready for a Latina governor?One of my favorite tales from the vault of family lore involves a woman named Ignacia Jasso, who was better known as “La Nacha”. As the tale goes, in the late 1930s or early 40s, a distant relative eloped with one of La Nacha’s daughters. But La Nacha did not approve of this marriage and, as the head of one of the first Mexican drug syndicates based in Juarez, she ordered that the relative be shot. He survived, and fled Texas, where he died of natural causes decades later in another state....
__label__3 How millennials and Gen Z are remaking the GOPAriel Hill-Davis likes to jokingly refer to herself as a “geriatric millennial.” She’s a Republican, but as a self-proclaimed “hardcore moderate” she’s been called a RINO (Republican in name only) pretty much since the moment she entered the political sphere in 2008. Through her work with Republican Women for Progress, Hill-Davis, who lives in Washington, D.C., is hoping to reshape the party to appeal to a broader swath of people, including millennial women like herself. “Because I’m a moderate, I’m going to have to fight for space in the Republican...
__label__1 Jury begins deliberating in Kyle Rittenhouse murder trialSean Krajacic/ Pool via REUTERSThe judge in the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse instructed the jury on Tuesday to begin deliberating on the fate of the teenager, who killed two men and wounded a third during racial justice protests last year. The jury, which numbered 18 through two weeks of testimony, was whittled down to 12 for deliberations. Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder told the jury to begin weighing the case, which pits the prosecution's argument that Rittenhouse recklessly shot the men without justification, against the teenager's assertion that...
__label__4 Suburbs take center stage as U.S. growth slowsIn 1990, fewer than 10,000 people lived in Meridian, Idaho, a sleepy bedroom community surrounded by farmland. Now, with a population of 117,600, its main thoroughfare, Eagle Road, gets so congested at rush hour that motorists might forget they're in one the country’s most sparsely populated states. The 2020 Census listed Meridian as one of the 10 fastest-growing large cities in the country. All the cities on the list grew at rates of more than 44 percent. They are all in the South and the West. And they are all...
__label__3 School Forced Teacher to Take Down ‘Political’ Pro-Police Flag, Despite Allowing BLM SymbolsA teacher in Washington state was reportedly forced to remove a pro-police flag from her middle school classroom after administrators deemed it a “political message,” despite allowing messages in support of Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride flags to remain posted in the school. While the Marysville Middle School teacher wished to remain anonymous, her brother, Chris Sutherland, told The Jason Rantz Show that administrators told his sister it is “controversial” to display a “Thin Blue Line” flag in her classroom and that it “makes kids and staff feel unsafe.” The teacher had hung...
__label__2 Judge dismisses charge against U.S. teen Rittenhouse for possessing rifleA Wisconsin judge in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on Monday dismissed a misdemeanor charge against the U.S. teenager for illegally possessing the AR-15-style rifle he used to shoot three people, killing two, in what he says was self defense.In dismissing the charge, Judge Bruce Schroeder say the law on possession was unclear. Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shootings.
__label__4 You Are the Object of a Secret Extraction OperationOPINIONFacebook is not just any corporation. It reached trillion-dollar status in a single decade by applying the logic of what I call surveillance capitalism — an economic system built on the secret extraction and manipulation of human data — to its vision of connecting the entire world. Facebook and other leading surveillance capitalist corporations now control information flows and communication infrastructures across the world. These infrastructures are critical to the possibility of a democratic society, yet our democracies have allowed these companies to own, operate and mediate our information spaces unconstrained by...
__label__2 ‘Our Identity Has Been Hijacked’ANALYSISWhen the Taliban first imposed its vision for Afghanistan’s cultural and political landscape between 1996 and 2001, the country’s women were subjected to wide-ranging forms of gender-based hardships. In addition to policies—like mandatory burqas, education bans, and forced isolation— designed to expel 50 percent of the population from the public eye and positions of power, Afghan women suffered rampant sexual assault, the very thing the former decrees ostensibly protected against.  With the fall of Kabul and the Taliban’s formation of an all-male “interim” government, the jihadist group’s treatment of women...
__label__1 Did state’s own witnesses hurt Rittenhouse case?Prosecutors wrapped up more than a week of testimony at Kyle Rittenhouse’s homicide trial after calling more than a dozen witnesses — some appearing to help the defense more than the prosecution. The onus was on prosecutors to counter Rittenhouse’s self-defense claim in shooting dead two men and wounding a third at a protest in Kenosha last year following the shooting of Jacob Blake, who is Black, by a white police officer. The defense team began their case on Tuesday. Rittenhouse, then 17, fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum at a car lot. After running from...
__label__4 The next big cyberthreat isn't ransomware. It's killware. And it's just as bad as it sounds.ANALYSISEven as most Americans are still learning about the hacking-for-cash crime of ransomware, the nation’s top homeland security official is worried about an even more dire digital danger: killware, or cyberattacks that can literally end lives. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in April galvanized the public’s attention because of its consumer-related complications, including long lines at gas stations, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with USA TODAY's Editorial Board last week. But, "there was a cyber incident that very fortunately did not succeed," he added. "And that is an attempted hack of a...

__label__2 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...
__label__4 US Military Bought Cameras in Violation of America's Own China SanctionsNUMEROUS FEDERAL AGENCIES, including several branches of the military, buy video surveillance equipment that can’t legally be used in U.S. government systems and that is made by Chinese companies sanctioned on national security grounds, records and products reviewed by The Intercept indicate. The agencies purchased blacklisted hardware through a network of American resellers that claimed the camera systems were in compliance with the sanctions. Those claims in numerous cases had little apparent basis, according a joint investigation with IPVM, a video surveillance industry research publication. The security sanctions originated in the 2019...

__label__2 Inside the controversial US gunshot-detection firmShotSpotter's incident-review room is like any other call centre. Analysts wearing headsets sit by computer screens, listening intently. Yet the people working here have an extraordinary responsibility. They make the final decision on whether a computer algorithm has correctly identified a gunshot - and whether to dispatch the police. Making the wrong call has serious consequences. ShotSpotter has garnered much negative press over the last year. Allegations range from its tech not being accurate, to claims that ShotSpotter is fuelling discrimination in the police. In the wake of those negative...
__label__4 The world's top ransomware gangs have created a cybercrime "cartel"Several of the largest Russian ransomware cybercriminal gangs have partnered up and are sharing hacking techniques, purloined data-breach information, malware code and technology infrastructure. The most active collaborators are four groups known as Wizard Spider, Twisted Spider, Viking Spider and LockBit. The gangs in this cluster jointly control access to illicit data leak sites and custom ransomware code. They also associate with the larger criminal ransomware ecosystem, exert influence over smaller gangs and license their tools to affiliates, said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1. The groups do not appear to share profits from criminal activity.

__label__4 U.S., allies accuse China of hacking Microsoft and condoning other cyberattacksThe United States, the European Union, NATO and other world powers on Monday accused the Chinese government of a broad array of malicious cyber activities, blaming its Ministry of State Security and hackers allegedly linked to it for a sophisticated attack on Microsoft’s widely used email server software earlier this year. The condemnations represent the first time NATO, a 30-nation alliance, has denounced alleged Chinese cyberattacks and follow the Biden administration’s pledge in June to rally U.S. allies against Beijing’s behavior. The number of nations involved amounts to the largest condemnation...
__label__3 Fact Checking ‘Absolutely 9-0,’ the Latest Documentary From Mike LindellFACT CHECKOn June 3, MyPillow CEO and Donald Trump supporter Mike Lindell released a third documentary claiming that Trump won the 2020 presidential election. The latest, Absolutely 9-0, follows Lindell’s previous two documentaries, Absolute Proof and Absolute Interference, both of which we have previously fact checked. All three claim, despite a lack of evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.  Lindell claims that Absolutely 9-0 will show why he has been “100% sure that when this gets before the Supreme Court it’s going to be 9-0,” adding that “this was 100% an attack by China on our country...

According to one former prosecutor, political courage may be the key to justice in this case. When Omar Ashmawy, then a United States Air Force officer, volunteered for the job of prosecuting Guantanamo Bay detainees in 2007, he had high hopes for America’s prospects of dispensing justice.  “I believed in the idea that military tribunals historically have been a way for nation-states to resolve crimes against humanity, and I think terrorism very much qualifies as a crime against humanity,” he says.  The...
__label__5 DoJ reclaims millions paid to hackers after attack that hobbled US pipelineThe US Justice Department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyberattack that caused the operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said Monday. The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware taskforce created by the Biden administration, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world.

Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...
__label__4 Can Biden Make Corporate America Care About Cybersecurity?ANALYSISA cyberattack last week that shut down a pipeline, which carries nearly half of the East Coast’s jet fuel and gasoline, raises the question for the zillionth time: When is the government going to start taking serious measures to prevent, or at least minimize, these debilitating—potentially catastrophic—incidents? One possibly serious step is about to take place—the installment of a first-ever National Cyber Director, an official vested (at least on paper) with powers to order, coordinate, and enforce cybersecurity actions in the public and private sector. It’s pathetic that this step...
__label__3 Top Cybersecurity Official Has a Warning About Ransomware AttacksA top cybersecurity official said Wednesday that ransomware attacks against critical industries in the U.S., such as those against Colonial Pipeline and JBS, have become “more brazen” and warned they are likely to continue. Chris Butera, head of Threat Hunting for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said during a virtual summit on Wednesday that ransomware actors have “started to exfiltrate data and try to extort payments.” “I do think we will continue to see that happen," Butera added.  Earlier this week a ransomware attack by Russian actors targeted the...
__label__2 Bipartisan police reform negotiations end without dealBipartisan talks on reforming police tactics and accountability, prompted by George Floyd's murder in May 2020, have ended without a compromise, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a key negotiator, said Wednesday. Why it matters: Lawmakers, led by Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Booker, had been working toward a bipartisan deal for months but things fell apart due to disagreements on qualified immunity and other issues. Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits unless they violate a clearly established constitutional right. It generally means public officials are...

Why it matters: The analysis, published recently in Criminology further illustrates the racial disparities of federal sentencing at a time when advocates are pushing for sentencing reforms for nonviolent offenders. Details: An examination of more than 366,000 offenders convicted and sentenced in 90 federal district courts from 2010 to 2017 found racial disparities around life sentences targeting Black offenders. (The research excluded offenses related to immigration law.) More than 4,800 of all offenders were eligible...
__label__4 'Time is not on our side' — Biden navigates cyber attacks without a cyber czarThe Biden White House is facing multiple cyber attacks and cyber espionage campaigns targeting U.S. companies and government agencies, without the services of a cybersecurity czar to coordinate a response and keep lawmakers in the loop. The role, known officially as the national cyber director, remains unfilled two months into Joe Biden’s presidency despite a legal mandate that it be occupied. Congress had ordered the creation of the post in a defense bill it enacted late last year over then-President Donald Trump’s veto. And they expected the Biden White House...

That’s according to a detailed intelligence report, produced by the New York Police Department and obtained by The Intercept, which finds that cellphone towers and other critical infrastructure have become an attractive target for conspiracy theorists, especially in the weeks and months following the presidential election. Conspiracy theorists, joined by far-right white supremacist groups, “increasingly target critical infrastructure to incite fear, disrupt essential services, and cause economic damage...
__label__3 The House Just Voted To Let Marijuana Businesses Legally Use BanksOn Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of letting state-legal marijuana businesses have access to banks and other financial institutions. It was a historic bipartisan moment, and an important one—though one that skirts the larger and more important matter of changing how the federal government treats marijuana. The bill was the first stand-alone marijuana legalization bill to pass either chamber of Congress. The SAFE Banking Act—the acronym stands for "Secure and Fair Enforcement"—would shield banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions from being held liable for doing...

Former U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr officially designated as special counsel last year, is reportedly exploring criminal charges against lower-level FBI officials and tipsters who may have provided false leads to the bureau in the 2016 investigation.

The Justice Department temporarily expanded the DEA’s power to collect information on protesters — and to share that intelligence with other law enforcement agencies and make arrests for non-drug related crimes — last weekend. The measure, first reported by BuzzFeed News, followed remarks by Attorney General William Barr that blamed, without evidence, “anarchistic and far left...

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo insists that the narcotics officers who shot and killed a middle-aged couple on January 28 after breaking into their home "had probable cause to be there," even though they were executing a search warrant that was based on a fraudulent affidavit. Acevedo's position is pretty puzzling, since the sole basis for the no-knock search warrant, which led to a...
__label__1 In push for police reform, small steps no longer enoughPolice reform used to be about small steps. But the past year has brought a seismic shift. The goal is now to reconsider the nature of policing itself. When it comes to policing and violence, Ronal Serpas has what might seem like an odd suggestion: Wind the clock back 50 years. As heated as the public debate around policing is today, years of social unrest had the United States in a similar place in the 1960s. In response, President Lyndon Johnson set up a commission to explore the problems and...

Skin peeled from her arms and back. Doctors administered more antibiotics, more...

But once on the ground in Mexico, from where they hope to smuggle their contraband into the United States, those tiny planes will be greeted by a swarm of Mexican law enforcement. What’s more, they will never know a Department of Homeland Security plane was flying within 100 feet of them,...

Meanwhile, in a separate decision, the government has announced it will start allowing more universities to start growing marijuana for research purposes. Currently it is only allowed at the University of...

Three years ago, Ukraine filed an international legal challenge against Australia, over Australia’s right to enact antismoking laws on its own soil. To a number of lawmakers, the case seemed absurd, and they wanted to investigate why it was even being pursued. When it came time to defend the tobacco industry, a man named Taras Kachka spoke up. He argued that several “fantastic tobacco companies” had bought up Soviet-era factories and modernized...

He said last week, “It’s time to end the forever war.” We should “be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again. We did that. We accomplished that objective.” Biden sounds like his predecessor, Donald Trump, whom I...

Contrasting styles of worship were a source of tension after the Civil War and during mass migrations of Southern Black people to Northern cities, when Black Northerners objected to expressive forms of worship that were common in the South, such as dancing in church. Today, there are few regional differences among Black Americans when it comes to worship styles, but Black Southerners diverge...

__label__2 Biden warns Putin on Russian ransomware attacksPresident Biden spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday and urged him to take action to disrupt criminal groups operating in Russia that are behind recent ransomware attacks in the United States. Biden also warned that the U.S. would “take any necessary action to defend its people and its critical infrastructure in the face of this continuing challenge,” according to a White House readout. The conversation came after a ransomware attack last week on software company Kaseya impacted up to 1,500 companies, many of which were vulnerable small businesses in...
__label__5 Even Trump’s Defense Secretary During the Capitol Riot Blames Him for Inciting ItANALYSISOne of the most senior Cabinet officials in the Trump administration, Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, has told VICE on Showtime that he believes the speech made by former President Donald Trump on the morning of January 6 was responsible for causing the mob to violently attack the Capitol later that day. Trump installed Miller after firing his predecessor Mark Esper in the days after the election. Speaking exclusively to VICE on Showtime, Miller said, “Would anybody have marched on the Capitol, and tried to overrun the Capitol, without...

__label__2 Pentagon cancels disputed JEDI cloud contract with MicrosoftThe Pentagon said Tuesday it canceled a disputed cloud-computing contract with Microsoft that could eventually have been worth $10 billion. It will instead pursue a deal with both Microsoft and Amazon and possibly other cloud service providers. “With the shifting technology environment, it has become clear that the JEDI Cloud contract, which has long been delayed, no longer meets the requirements to fill the DoD’s capability gaps,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The statement did not directly mention that the Pentagon faced extended legal challenges by Amazon to the...
__label__5 Austin confirmed as nation’s first African American defense secretaryRetired four-star Army general Lloyd Austin became the first African American defense secretary on Friday, shattering a racial barrier for the United States armed forces and underscoring President Biden’s commitment to diversity within his Cabinet. The Senate confirmed Austin, 67, as the president’s nominee in a 93-to-2 vote, giving the incoming Pentagon boss a near-unanimous bipartisan congressional mandate, as he sets about overseeing the 2.9 million service members and civilians across the world who fall under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Defense. For Austin to be confirmed, the...
__label__3 America thinks the unthinkable: More than half of Trump voters and 41% of Biden supporters want red and blue states to SECEDE from one another and form two new countries, shock new poll findsMany breathed a sigh of relief when President Biden was elected, not for policy but for a reunification of the country after four years of tumult and fiery division under President Trump. But eight months into the new presidency, America's deep disunity might not be letting up.  A new poll has revealed that political divisions run so deep in the US that over half of Trump voters want red states to secede from the union, and 41% of Biden voters want blue states to split off.   According to the analysis from the University...
__label__2 China is reining in one of its most successful tech businesses just days after its US IPOChina’s cybersecurity regulator has ordered all app stores in the country to block downloads of Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ride-hailing app. The Cyberspace Administration accused Didi of improperly collecting and using its customers’ personal data.For now, the app’s existing 600 million users and drivers customers can continue using Didi normally, so long as they have already downloaded the app. But new customers will not be able to start using the service until the company addresses the regulators’ data concerns.
__label__4 New Pentagon chief racing to make changes before Trump's exitActing Defense Secretary Chris Miller has just 63 days to put his stamp on the Pentagon.Miller, a former Green Beret and counterterrorism professional, has been unexpectedly vaulted from midlevel National Security Council desk officer to Pentagon chief in under a year. Now, Miller is looking to use his position to make quick policy changes that incoming President Joe Biden is unlikely to overturn before the clock runs out on the Trump administration in late January.
__label__3 In Post-COVID Election, Democrats Claim They Fought To Open SchoolsOPINIONIn 2020, Americans’ lives were disrupted as teachers refused to work even as parents still had to go to their jobs. How would moms and dads manage to not get fired, while watching their kids all day and serving as de facto teachers? In some Democrat-controlled states, politicians did not seem to care. National statistics show that whether a school district was closed for an extended period was correlated less with how severe coronavirus was there, than the political power of unions. Shortly before the pandemic, Virginia state legislators expanded the power...
__label__1 Gang behind huge cyber-attack demands $70m in BitcoinThe gang behind a "colossal" ransomware attack has demanded $70m (£50.5m) paid in Bitcoin in return for a "universal decryptor" that it says will unlock the files of all victims. The REvil group claims its malware, which initially targeted US IT firm Kaseya, has hit one million "systems". This number has not been verified and the exact total of victims is unknown. However, it does include 500 Swedish Coop supermarkets and 11 schools in New Zealand. Two Dutch IT firms have also been hit, according to local media reports. On Friday, cyber-security firm Huntress...
__label__4 Inflation emerges as a 2022 campaign dividing lineTight congressional races across the nation are quickly turning into battlegrounds over a key economic question: whether President Joe Biden’s spending agenda is the chief culprit for inflation concerns gripping the country. Republicans are latching onto heightened anxiety tied to the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in three decades. Democrats, meanwhile, are scrambling to preempt the attacks by focusing on broader benefits of the multitrillion-dollar packages. The opposing bets on the infrastructure and social spending plans are laying the groundwork for a year of sparring tied to voters’ growing worries about...
__label__3 Senate Dems undercut Schumer’s claims of unity on tax hikes: ‘We don’t have an agreement’Members of Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer’s leadership team contradicted his claims Thursday that Democrats had agreed to a “framework” of tax hikes to pay for a $3.5 trillion expansion of the federal welfare state. Mr. Schumer’s closest allies, including Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, said they had not seen the framework or agreed to its contents. “I haven’t seen it,” said Mr. Durbin, Illinois Democrat. He was among several in the leadership team who said they weren’t part of an agreement. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Democratic Policy...
__label__1 US companies hit by 'colossal' cyber-attackAbout 200 US businesses have been hit by a "colossal" ransomware attack, according to a cyber-security firm. Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a "potential attack". Huntress Labs said it believed the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal agency, said in a statement that it was taking action to address the attack. The cyber-breach emerged on Friday afternoon as...
__label__5 Democrats have no plan to fight housing inflationOPINIONInflation has taken center stage, and the White House desperately wants its signature bill to be the solution. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that in October, its main measure of inflation saw an increase of 6.2 percent, “the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1990.” The official response was to argue that the Build Back Better plan, President Biden’s social spending package, is the path forward to fighting inflation. This line is not a new one. “If your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more...

__label__4 No One Is Prepared for the New GerrymandersOPINIONToward the end of the last decade, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices effectively abolished constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering. But don’t worry about it, Chief Justice John Roberts told the country: You, the citizens, can fix this problem yourselves! States “are actively addressing the issue on a number of fronts,” Roberts promised, and Congress isn’t far behind. “The avenue for reform established by the Framers,” he assured readers, “and used by Congress in the past, remains open.” Two years later, this passage reads like a twisted joke....
__label__3 N.Y. And N.J. To Receive Federal Aid After Deadly FloodingNew York and New Jersey were granted to receive much needed federal aid as they have struggled to recover from Hurricane Ida. Joe Biden issued disaster declarations in both states on Sunday and approved federal aid for the hardest hit areas in the region. The storm killed dozens of people in the northeast, while destroying multiple homes and public infrastructure. FEMA officials said the federal aid could be used for temporary housing, home repairs and to help businesses recover from the disaster. “What we saw today was absolutely heartbreaking, the...
__label__1 Ransomware attacks: How should the U.S. respond?Ransomware attacks are increasingly targeting companies’ computer systems, demanding money in exchange for returning access and data. Last month, hackers breached Colonial Pipeline — which supplies 100 million gallons of fuel daily along a 5,500-mile pipeline — and gained access to its business networks. In response, Colonial shut down pipeline operations, which led to nearly a week of widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast. The CEO of Colonial Pipeline testified before a Senate committee last week, explaining his decision to pay a multimillion-dollar ransom to regain access: “I made the decision...
__label__5 Two recounts appear likely in tight Virginia House racesDays after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts show Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by The Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are under 0.5%, which...
__label__3 Biden Says Feds ‘Moving Quickly’ to Boost Gasoline Deliveries to Areas Hit Hard by Hurricane IdaPresident Joe Biden said Friday that his administration is pushing to boost gasoline deliveries to regions badly impacted by Hurricane Ida, where flooding, road closures, and downed power lines have led to gas shortages, leaving residents scrambling to find fuel for generators. Biden said at a Friday press briefing in LaPlace, Louisiana, that measures to boost fuel supplies include dipping into the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to enable refiners in the region to access the crude they need to continue operations, while providing flexibility for truck drivers to ramp up gasoline deliveries. “We’re...
__label__2 How A New Team Of Feds Hacked The Hackers And Got Colonial Pipeline's Ransom BackThe Department of Justice on Monday touted the recovery of $2.3 million — about half — of the ransom that was collected by hackers in the Colonial Pipeline attack last month. Experts say it was a surprising outcome to an increasingly frequent and severe crime. "Ransomware is very seldom recovered," said April Falcon Doss, executive director of the Institute for Technology Law and Policy at Georgetown Law, who described it as "a really big win" for the government. "What we don't know is whether or not this is going to pave the...
__label__5 Progressives Helped Biden Pass His Infrastructure Bill. But They Gave Up Their Leverage.ANALYSISHouse progressives backed down on Friday, giving President Joe Biden a chance to claim a win—even as his party’s hopes of enacting a broader agenda wobbled. In remarks Saturday morning, Biden said that the infrastructure bill will create millions of jobs. “Yesterday we took a monumental step forward as a nation,” he said. “And we’re just getting started.” Progressives permitted passage of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill without assurance that the bigger prize they have spent months holding out for—a far-reaching package of climate, family and health provisions—will also become law....
__label__3 Here’s What Migrants Say About Why They’re Coming To The US NowSome migrants who spoke to the DCNF said they were motivated to come to the U.S. by the Biden administration, while others cited death threats from “narcos” and disaster in their home countries. “Suddenly, the situations during the previous years weren’t like this one. This year was much more difficult,” a Honduran migrant named Javier told the DCNF after illegally crossing into the U.S. near the Hidalgo Point of Entry early Tuesday morning. Javier said increasing “crime and a lot of insecurity” including “extortions and death threats from the cartels”...
__label__1 Senate sergeant at arms says cyberattack more worrisome than repeat of Jan. 6 insurrectionSenate Sergeant at Arms Karen Gibson said Saturday she is more concerned about a cyberattack on the government than another insurrection like the one that rocked Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. “Our networks ... have attempted intrusions every single day. And so, cybersecurity for me is a much greater concern than the prospect of thousands of people storming the West Terrace,” Gibson said in an interview that aired on CNN Saturday. “Members have sensitive information that they would not necessarily want to have disclosed that may be in documents. Much of what...
__label__5 Democrats Face Economic Gut-Check After GOP Taps Voters’ AngstANALYSISDemocrats will argue for months about what led to their defeat at the ballot box on Tuesday -- whether it was their messaging, their candidates or their president. But there was consensus that the first step is to get something done on economic issues. One day after an embarrassing loss in the Virginia gubernatorial election and a dispiritingly tight race in New Jersey, Democrats from President Joe Biden to moderate and progressive members of Congress cast passage of his infrastructure and $1.75 trillion social spending package as a panacea for...
__label__3 At least 29 dead in Haiti after 7.2 magnitude earthquake hits Caribbean nation: Quake is stronger than the 2010 disaster that killed thousandsAt least 29 people have been killed after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on Saturday, just days before a tropical storm is expected to make landfall. The major quake hit five miles from the town of Petit Trou de Nippes, about 7.5 miles west of Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, and was felt across the Caribbean with people fleeing their homes for fear that buildings might collapse. The 7.2 magnitude quake was stronger and closer to the surface than the magnitude 7.1 quake that damaged much of the capital in 2010 and killed...
__label__1 U.S. to give ransomware hacks similar priority as terrorism, official saysThe U.S. Department of Justice is elevating investigations of ransomware attacks to a similar priority as terrorism in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline hack and mounting damage caused by cyber criminals, a senior department official told Reuters.Internal guidance sent on Thursday to U.S. attorney’s offices across the country said information about ransomware investigations in the field should be centrally coordinated with a recently created task force in Washington.
__label__4 Pramila Jayapal is one of the most powerful leaders on Capitol Hill right nowANALYSISDemocratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal has risen quickly in the ranks of Washington to become a powerful progressive leader on Capitol Hill since first winning her House seat in 2016. Democrats control extremely narrow majorities in Congress, a dynamic that has empowered moderates as well as progressives and the two factions have become locked in a power struggle. Against that backdrop, the Washington state Democrat has become a prominent voice for the party's left flank and liberal policies as chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Before coming to represent Seattle in Congress, Jayapal was...

__label__2 What We Know About The Apparent Russian Hack Exploiting A U.S. Aid AgencyThe same Russian hackers who carried out the SolarWinds attack and other malicious campaigns have now attacked groups involved in international development, human rights and other issues, according to Microsoft. The company says the breach began with a takeover of an email marketing account used by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Hackers sent malicious emails from the agency's account.

__label__5 Why the Virginia Election Is Freaking Democrats OutOPINIONWith just under a week to go, the governor’s race in Virginia has gotten tighter than Spanx on a hippo, prompting much agita in Democratic circles. When the Democrats won full control of the statehouse in 2019, for the first time in over 20 years, many political watchers declared the swing state’s blue shift complete. But a recent poll from Monmouth University has the party’s nominee, the former governor Terry McAuliffe, tied with Glenn Youngkin, a former private equity exec who has flirted with the election-fraud lies that are now dogma in Donald Trump’s G.O.P.

Kyrsten Sinema — a key Democratic swing vote — has said she will not be putting off August vacation plans to vote on the bipartisan infrastructure deal and $3.5 trillion reconciliation budget bill, according to a report. Sinema, who previously said she would not support the $3.5 trillion bill that Democrats plan to push through with no Republican support, told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) of her intentions to keep her summer plans, multiple unnamed sources told Politico’s Playbook.
__label__2 DHS to require pipeline companies to report cyberattacksThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will issue a directive later this week requiring all pipeline companies to report cyber incidents to federal authorities after a devastating ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline forced a shutdown of operations. The Washington Post first reported that DHS’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for securing critical pipelines, will issue the directive this week following concerns that pipeline operators are not required to report cyber incidents, unlike other critical infrastructure sectors. A spokesperson for DHS told The Hill in an emailed statement Tuesday that...
__label__4 The World ‘Has Found a Way to Do This’: The U.S. Lags on Paid LeaveANALYSISCongress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave. But it would still be an outlier. Of the 185 countries that offer paid leave for new mothers, only one, Eswatini (once called Swaziland), offers fewer than four weeks. Of the...
__label__3 America's choice: Build bridges or grow governmentOPINIONWe face a pivotal choice for the direction of our country. We have an opportunity to pass a very important transportation and infrastructure bill or go down the path of the most massive level of spending ever contemplated in the history of the United States. We are witnessing the Left attempting to justify a historically preposterous expansion of government by leveraging a crisis that is largely already behind us. People weathered significant challenges during the pandemic. To mitigate the effects of this crisis, Congress authorized relief spending, much of which...
__label__1 SolarWinds CEO says hackers may have struck months earlier than thoughtThe company had previously said it had learned that the hackers had been inside the company in Septmember 2019, but Sudhakar Ramakrishna said on Wednesday it appeared that they had been doing “reconnaissance” at the beginning of that year, almost two years before the hacking was detected elsewhere. He spoke at the annual RSA Conference on security, which is being held virtually this year. The hackers, accused by the United States of working for Russian intelligence, were unsually sophisticated and modified code in SolarWinds network management software that was downloaded...
__label__5 Sinema’s Tax-Rate Blockade Prods Democrats Left Toward Billionaires’ TaxSenator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona and one of her party’s only holdouts on President Biden’s sprawling budget bill, has cultivated a profile in Congress as a business-minded centrist. But her refusal to raise tax rates on high earners and major corporations to pay for Mr. Biden’s plan is pushing Democrats toward wealth taxation and other measures once embraced only by the party’s left flank. The frenzied search for new paths around Ms. Sinema’s tax-rate blockade has cheered liberals but raised serious qualms among more moderate Democrats, who now openly say they hope that...
__label__3 Urban Policy Can Help Bridge Political DividesOPINIONUrbanists lament the fact that the average American knows and cares little about the built environment, but this sad reality has a significant upside. Because urban policy is a relatively fringe topic, it presents what is in today’s political climate a rare opportunity: the chance to make converts to conservative principles through rational persuasion. As the left and right solidify into ever more intransigent blocs, thoughtful dialogue has been relegated to internal discussions, while cross-faction exchanges have little hope of changing minds. There are myriad explanations for the trend, but...

__label__5 Republicans Are Passing Rigged Maps and Democrats Are Running Out of Time to Stop ItIt took Texas Republicans less than 30 days to pass redistricting maps for Congress and the state legislature that will help them retake the US House in 2022 and entrench control of state politics for the next decade. Meanwhile, it’s been 230 days since the House of Representatives passed federal legislation—the For the People Act—that would roll back the gerrymandering and voter suppression enacted by GOP-controlled states such as Texas, but the Senate has taken no action to protect voting rights while Republican-dominated states relentlessly undermine them. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled...
__label__3 Republicans Shouldn’t Fall for Biden’s Infrastructure CharadeANALYSISLast month, we warned Republicans about the pitfalls of indulging President Biden’s infrastructure fantasies. The bipartisan framework announced Thursday isn’t causing us to change our mind. There is much to dislike about the so-called compromise proposal (even putting aside the minor detail that the nation’s infrastructure is not, in fact, in dire need of repair). The deal negotiated by a group of five Republicans and five Democrats would mean $579 billion in new spending that, when slapped on top of what the federal government is already slated to spend on infrastructure, could mean $1.2...

__label__5 David Shor Is Telling Democrats What They Don’t Want to HearOPINIONPresident Biden’s agenda is in peril. Democrats hold a bare 50 seats in the Senate, which gives any member of their caucus the power to block anything he or she chooses, at least in the absence of Republican support. And Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are wielding that leverage ruthlessly.But here’s the truly frightening thought for frustrated Democrats: This might be the high-water mark of power they’ll have for the next decade.

"We have a deal," President Biden announced as he walked out of the White House surrounded by a bipartisan group of senators. With most of his top legislative priorities stalled on Capitol Hill, he announced he'd struck a $1.2 trillion deal on a scaled-back version of...

__label__4 The 2022 Races That Could Determine if Trump Steals the Election in 2024ANALYSISArizona’s partisan election review concluded last month by finding more votes for Joe Biden in its flawed hand count of Maricopa County and without alleging any specific fraud. Despite these findings, the partisan review offered false and unvetted innuendo about “anomalies” in the 2020 election that were parroted by Donald Trump to claim that he had been indicated in his lie that the election was stolen. The result of the failed and illegitimate Arizona election review has not made the Big Lie go away. Instead, other states have pushed for similar reviews with Trump’s backing, including in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and...

__label__1 U.S.-Mexico Efforts Targeting Drug Cartels Have Unraveled, Top DEA Official SaysA senior Drug Enforcement Administration official told NPR efforts to target drug cartels operating inside Mexico have unraveled because of a breakdown in cooperation between law enforcement agencies and militaries in the two countries. "We're willing to share [intelligence] with our counterparts in Mexico, but they themselves are too afraid to even engage with us because of repercussions from their own government if they get caught working with DEA," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's deputy chief of operations. The collapse of joint drug interdiction efforts has occurred at a time...

New covid infections in the United States have fallen twenty-five per cent over the past couple of weeks. Vaccine mandates by large companies and government agencies, many of them imposed at President Biden’s behest, seem to be working—without vaccine-refusenik workers quitting en masse, as threatened. As recent weeks go for the Biden Administration, this one was not terrible. Then again, not shutting down the government because you managed to pass and sign a bill pushing the problem off until early December is...

__label__2 Legalization Advocates Hope to End Mexico’s Drug WarA determined political movement to end the war on drugs has taken shape across Europe and North America. Harm reduction advocates say lives can be saved and resources spared, if only the state would move away from punishing drug users. Perhaps, some predict, the state could even get into the business of regulating the production and sale of once-illegal substances. Just last month, voters in Oregon and politicians in Vancouver, British Columbia, approved plans to decriminalize all illicit drugs, paving the way for a health care approach. They’re following the...
__label__4 When Democrats Go Small, They Lose BigOPINIONPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt taught Democrats how to keep power by enacting bold programs that spoke to the pressing needs of working-class Americans. Unfortunately, the heirs to what is still referred to as “the party of FDR” have spent the better part of 75 years trying to unlearn that lesson. This week, as Democrats toy with the politics of compromise and concession in a high-profile fight over spending priorities, they are once again breaking faith with what was best about FDR’s approach. At the same time, they are setting themselves...
__label__3 Elaine Chao hints Biden could secure bipartisan infrastructure deal provided it's not bloatedFormer Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the Biden administration has orchestrated a “skillful” rollout of its infrastructure proposal, even though she said the plan is too bloated with “superfluous” programs to attract Republican support.“I think this administration has been very skillful at rolling out their proposal and deploying the Cabinet secretaries to talk to their various constituent groups about this proposal, and they had a proposal ready from the transition,” Chao told the Washington Examiner.
__label__2 Trump praises scientists for developing AIDS vaccine that doesn’t existPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday falsely suggested that scientists have developed a vaccine for AIDS, the late stage of HIV infection in which the virus badly damages the immune system. “They’ve come up with the AIDS vaccine,” Trump said during a press conference on police reform, referring to scientists. “As you know, there’s various things, and now various companies are involved.” Trump later appeared to backtrack those comments, saying, “AIDS was a death sentence, and now people live a life with a pill. It’s an incredible thing.” The White House...
__label__4 ‘Non-starter’: Dems tangle over how to raise the debt ceilingANALYSISSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin says raising the debt ceiling via budget reconciliation is a “non-starter” that simply takes too long. Across the Capitol, his House counterpart Steny Hoyer put it differently: “Reconciliation is one option and that’s on the table.” Those mixed messages underscore the confusion among congressional Democrats about how the majority party and its slim majorities will avoid a potential default just three weeks away. Senate Republicans sank Democrats' plan to fund the government into December and kick the debt limit through the 2022 midterms, and now...

__label__4 Four Jagged Puzzle Pieces and a Few Weeks for Democrats to Assemble ThemANALYSISIn a pivotal week, in a make-or-break stretch for President Biden’s domestic agenda, congressional Democrats are trying to assemble a puzzle of four jagged pieces that may or may not fit together. Making them work as a whole is critical for the party’s agenda and political prospects, and how quickly they can assemble the puzzle will determine whether the government suffers another costly and embarrassing shutdown — or, worse yet, a first-ever default on its debt that could precipitate a global economic crisis. Here are all the moving parts. Piece...
__label__3 Ric Grenell: Susan Rice Acting as 'Shadow President' for 'Weak' BidenRic Grenell, who served as acting director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration, is blasting Susan Rice and says she is acting as a “shadow president.” His comments came during an interview on CPAC Now. An excerpt of the interview was posted on Twitter by the Conservative Political Action conference. “Susan Rice has been appointed as domestic policy adviser,” he said. “ That’s a joke. She doesn’t know anything about domestic policy. “So, she’s a foreign policy expert that’s been placed in the domestic policy role. And that is...
__label__1 U.S. Spies on Millions of DriversThe Justice Department has been building a national database to track in real time the movement of vehicles around the U.S., a secret domestic intelligence-gathering program that scans and stores hundreds of millions of records about motorists, according to current and former officials and government documents. The primary goal of the license-plate tracking program, run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, is to seize cars, cash and other assets to combat drug trafficking, according to one government document. But the database’s use has expanded to hunt for vehicles associated with numerous...
__label__5 Facing a heap of defeat, progressives stake hopes on spending billImmigration, voting rights, policing, gun control: Congress is filled with liberal hopes crushed by the reality of slim Democratic majorities. So progressives are digging in on what could be their last chance at success in years. As Democrats race to pull together a multitrillion-dollar party-line social spending package, Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s left flank is pushing as hard as it can to see progressive priorities reflected. They’ve repeatedly vowed to tank a bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor as soon as this week if they don’t see more movement — a...
__label__3 Republicans describe 'productive' meeting with Biden, but no deal on infrastructureHouse and Senate leaders in both parties met with President Joe Biden for more than an hour Wednesday for “productive” talks that have not yet yielded a critical deal on infrastructure. Biden told reporters at the start of the meeting he will “try to reach some consensus” on an infrastructure accord, but the two parties remain starkly divided on the size, cost, and offsets for the massive plan put forward by Biden. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, described the meeting as productive but said Biden’s plan to...

It will instead pursue a deal with both Microsoft and Amazon and possibly other cloud service providers. “With the shifting technology environment, it has become clear that the JEDI Cloud contract, which has long been delayed, no longer meets the requirements to fill the DoD’s capability gaps,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The statement did not directly mention that the Pentagon faced extended legal challenges by Amazon to the...
__label__4 We can’t just run away from wildfiresANALYSISIt has been yet another breathtaking year for disasters. While Hurricane Ida drenched a path from New Orleans to New York, leaving flooding and power outages in its wake, wildfires forced thousands to evacuate and sent choking smoke across the US. Such disasters are a fact of life in many parts of the country, and the risks are only growing as human activity continues to warm the planet. For those living in the West within reach of devastating blazes, that raises a difficult question: Should I stay or should I go?

National Guard to intervene in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, the commanding general of the outfit told senators on Wednesday. Maj. Gen. William Walker testified he had National Guard troops at the ready and sitting idly for hours before he was finally given authorization to send them into the field. Walker said that the delay was caused at least in part over concerns of the optics of sending uniformed...
__label__4 Mudslide on scenic Colorado highway tests limits of aging infrastructure in era of climate changeThe flash flood roared down Glenwood Canyon with such force that it changed the course of the Colorado River. Torrents of mud, boulders as big as cars and toppled trees plunged down towering walls of rock carved over millennia. When it was over, the July 29 mudslide left a gaping hole in Interstate 70. The river of mud had breached a wall and swept across the highway, sending the eastbound deck crashing into the waterway and burying one of the most scenic drives in Colorado under 6 feet of debris.

Biden has pushed paying for the plan in part by raising corporate income taxes. "It's not just roads, bridges, highways," Biden said, according to The Washington Post. "That's what we're talking about. And I'm confident that everything is going to work out for us." He said the talks were...

At a briefing with local officials at St. John Parish’s Emergency Operations Center in LaPlace on Friday, Biden said he understood the frustration of many residents with the widespread lack of power.  “There’s nothing political about this. It’s just simply about saving lives and getting people back up and running,” Biden said. “We’re in this together, and so we’re not going to leave...
__label__3 Sen.

Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who rebuked the legislation as a "purely partisan exercise." "I think there's an easy win here for the White House if they would take that win, which is make this an infrastructure package, which is about 30% – even if you stretch the definition of infrastructure some – it's about 30% of the $2.25 trillion we are...
__label__1 Revolutionary Change or Practical Help? Democrats Struggle With the DifferenceAre President Biden and his Democratic Party proposing sweeping, revolutionary change to the economy and the government’s social contract with Americans? Or are they offering practical help to citizens struggling to overcome longstanding problems as they recover from the economic shock of a pandemic? Some Democrats describe the former, others the latter. The difference may seem merely semantic, but in fact it has significant substantive effect: The split goes to the heart of a division within the Democratic Party that has plagued the effort to pass the Biden agenda, and to the...

The toll was highest in New Jersey, where 25 people died in heavy rains late Wednesday and early Thursday, Gov. Phil Murphy said on NBC's "TODAY" show. He said six more people were missing. A majority of the people who lost their lives drowned after their vehicles were caught in flash floods, with some dying in their submerged cars and others getting swept...
__label__3 Ending Civil Asset Forfeiture Should Be a Bipartisan ProjectANALYSISDuring the seemingly endless run-up to the last election, my partisan friends would often say to me, "politics is binary." Their point is that voters only have two serious choices in any election, the Democrats or the Republicans. We need to pick a side and then, apparently, serve as cheerleaders for whatever that side is doing. As a libertarian who doesn't like either choice, I often scream in frustration. Baltimore Journalist H.L. Mencken succinctly captures my view of the reigning Democrats and Republicans: "Under democracy one party always devotes its...
__label__1 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...
__label__4 New Orleans Needs Its Own Power SupplyOPINIONIn a city gone dark, the St. Peter Apartments were a bright spot. After most of New Orleans’ power went out over the weekend, the 50-unit affordable housing complex in Mid-City had eight hours of electricity a day. That’s a luxury right this moment; nearly a million people in Louisiana have been without service since Hurricane Ida made landfall. Residents at St. Peter Apartments can charge their phones and run appliances thanks to a 178-kilowatt solar array on the roof and a battery downstairs. “We were able to give folks...
__label__2 Why Biden’s Infrastructure Bill Will Likely Only Worsen Supply Chain CrisisOPINIONPresident Joe Biden on Nov. 15 signed his infrastructure bill, a trillion-plus-dollar handout to left-wing special interests masquerading as a solution to the supply chain crisis he created. The administration is touting the bill as a fix, but the truth is, the bill is at best irrelevant, and most likely will make the crisis worse, at an enormous cost to taxpayers. The core of the supply chain crisis is a lack of capacity at ports and among truckers—and a historic shortage of workers, now at 10.4 million unfilled jobs nationwide. Together, these shortages drive inflation, empty...
__label__2 Virginia’s wake-up call: Democrats ignore rural voters at their perilShortly after Glenn Youngkin secured the Virginia GOP’s gubernatorial nomination, Andy McCready, chair of the Pulaski County Republicans, says he got a call from some data specialists on the Youngkin campaign.   “They sent me a printout of my county and said, ‘A typical Republican turnout in your county is 7,100 voters. Do you think we could get 7,300 voters to come to the polls?’” recalls Mr. McCready over a lunch special at Fatz Cafe, a restaurant off Interstate 81. “And I said, ‘Absolutely.’”  The Youngkin campaign didn’t just meet that...

In fact, food, like many goods and services, is costing us more as the flood of dollars unleashed by the federal government diminishes their value, ensuring our money doesn't go as far as it once did. If you're looking for a relative bright spot, count yourself lucky as an American, because things could be worse: Around the world, people generally far less prosperous than those in...
__label__2 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...
__label__5 Ida intensifies into 'catastrophic' Category 4 hurricaneHurricane Ida strengthened rapidly as it barreled its way towards Louisiana's coast early Sunday, prompting the National Hurricane Center to warn of "catastrophic" winds once it moved onshore. With top sustained winds of 150 mph, Ida was located about 50 miles southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, the NHC said in an advisory. If wind speeds reach 157 mph it will be considered a Category 5 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, a 1 to 5 rating based on maximum sustained wind speed. Only four storms have made landfall...
__label__3 Biden’s Inflation ProblemOPINIONThere’s no way to spin it: Wednesday’s inflation report is bad news for the country economically and for the president politically. The year-over-year overall increase was 6.2 percent, the highest rate in over 30 years. It wasn’t from any particular category of expenditure, either. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the increase was “broad-based,” with significant increases in energy, food, and shelter. The standout category in this month’s report was energy, which rose 30 percent overall since last year and — incredibly — 4.8 percent in just the last month. More specifically, gasoline...

According to a USA Today-Suffolk University poll, Biden's approval rating is currently at 38 percent, lower than another Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll taken since he took office and only just hovering above the president's all-time lows of 37 percent which were recorded by two other surveys in mid-October. Biden's approval rating is even suffering with those who voted for him in 2020. According to the results, 46...

High temperatures were forecast to soar 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit above average across the East on Wednesday, meaning that in cities including Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s could feel closer to 100 degrees when combined with high humidity. Away from the urban corridor, some interior locations such as Syracuse and Binghamton, New York, also are feeling the heat. Erie,...

Cindy Axne (D-IA) claimed last week that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will cost Iowans “literally nothing.” VERDICT: False. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will stick Americans with trillions more in debt. “This cost Iowans literally nothing,” Rep. Axne said of the far-left’s agenda during an interview on Let’s Talk Guthrie County. “If you’re making under $400,000, you know what you’re going to get? A tax break. Because this bill is literally the first time in a long time that we’ve had a substantial approach to helping working...
__label__2 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...

The rainfall was likely historic, the National Weather Service said. Preliminary data from McEwen, Tennessee, recorded more than 17 inches of rain — the highest ever in a 24-hour period in state history. On Sunday, rescue crews were going door to door in search of missing people, with deputies also responding to calls for welfare checks, Humphreys...
__label__3 Biden Moves to Wreck U.S. Oil IndustryOPINIONthe Biden administration is escalating its war against the American oil industry. According to an article in the November 2, 2021, Wall Street Journal, Biden’s EPA will soon issue regulations requiring that all associated natural gas released in conjunction with oil production be put in pipelines for delivery to market. The destructive impact of the proposed new regulations cannot be overstated. Oil producers already put associated natural gas in pipelines wherever they are available. The problem is that they are not always available. For example, they are never available offshore or in regions that are new...
__label__2 Voters punish Democrats amid left driftANALYSISFrom Virginia to New Jersey to Minnesota, voters in yesterday's off-year elections sent Democrats a warning for 2022: There could be a massive backlash to perceptions that progressives are pulling the party too far left. Why it matters: Now the finger-pointing begins. President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can use the wake-up call to try to force a reset, starting with swift passage of a long-stalled $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. But the same GOP gains that narrowed Dems' margins or flipped advantages in some swing...

Video shot above a residential neighborhood of Les Caves appeared to show rescuers painstakingly going through the pancaked ruins of a building. Furniture and air conditioning units could be seen tangled into the twisted concrete wreckage. The Haiti Civil Protection Agency said Sunday that 13,694 homes were destroyed and that 13,785 were damaged. Saturday's earthquake struck 78 miles west of the capital, Port-au-Prince, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
__label__3 Biden's spending plan could cost up to $4T, Penn Wharton analysis showsPresident Biden unveiled a revised framework last week for a modified social spending plan that imagines spending close to $1.75 trillion over the next decade, but a new analysis released Tuesday suggests the actual price tag is far higher. The newest "Build Back Better" proposal – pared down from the original $3.5 trillion request – would expand Medicaid, establish universal preschool, provide new funding for child care and offer green energy tax credits, though it notably omits progressive priorities like free community college and Medicare coverage of dental and vision. It relies on $1.95...
__label__2 Democrats' billionaires tax explainedANALYSISThere is now legislative language behind the push to tax American billionaires on unrealized capital gains, as Sen. Ron Wyden last night released his 107-page plan. Why it matters: This would be a sea change in U.S. tax policy, which has only applied to realized gains (otherwise known as income). Wyden's proposal would apply to those with more than $1 billion in assets or more than $100 million in adjusted gross income over three consecutive years. The biggest tax bills would come up front, charging a long-term cap gains rates on all...

But I remember one image with indelible clarity. It’s the face of a young woman in a color photograph on a flyer that appeared at the entrance to my subway stop in Brooklyn, around my neighborhood, and then all over the city. "We need your help," the flyer said. The sign was posted right after the attacks and stayed up long after it stopped being an...
__label__3 Dems Abandon Billionaire Tax That Faced Constitutional HurdlesAn aborted Democratic plan to tax assets held by billionaires was vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds, experts told the Washington Free Beacon. The Constitution authorizes three forms of taxation, and tax-law gurus interviewed by the Free Beacon said the ill-fated billionaire's tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories. The measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year—like a stock or a closely held company—which aren't currently taxed until they're sold. Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) on Wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire's tax...

On Monday, veteran Reps. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., and David Price, D-N.C., announced they would not run for another term in Congress. Their departures mean at least seven House Democrats will not seek reelection in 2022, compared with at least three Republicans, according to an NBC News tally. The retirements come as Democrats face the prospect of losing House control in the midterms....

__label__3 Democrats' Proposed 'Billionaire Tax' Is Definitely a Wealth Tax, and It May Be UnconstitutionalOPINIONPresident Joe Biden got himself elected partly by opposing the billionaires' wealth tax proposed during the primary campaign by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.). Now, in a reversal, Biden is preparing to embrace the idea. It wouldn't be the first time that a presidential candidate's plans changed after getting elected. The shamelessness of the way that Biden has shifted on the issue, though, is something else. It risks undercutting Biden's claim to being a voice of moderation. It also may reinforce voter cynicism. How's democracy supposed to...
__label__2 Biden Predicts Dems Are 'Going to Get Something Less' Than $3.5 Trillion for His Spending BillPresident Joe Biden says it is unlikely Democrats are going to get $3.5 trillion for his spending bill this year. While delivering remarks Friday, Biden explained, “The cost of the Build Back Better bill, in terms of adding to the deficit, is zero. So when I hear people say, ‘It cost $3.5 trillion…’ To be honest with you, we’re probably not going to get $3.5 trillion this year.” He added, “We’re going to get something less than that. But I’m going to negotiate, I’m going to get it done.” The president previously...

White House considering 4 ways to pay for spending packageCongressional lawmakers are still hammering out a deal on President Biden’s multitrillion-dollar spending package that would boost funding for infrastructure and clean energy, along with social spending initiatives. The president said this week he has agreed to cut the mammoth $3.5 trillion price tag, and reports have suggested lawmakers will land somewhere between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion. But some Democratic legislators, like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Az., have said they will not agree to a package that includes tax hikes on corporations and high earners. Here’s how the Biden administration has proposed paying for the package: Minimum corporate...
__label__2 Why Democrats may be facing a generation in the wildernessANALYSISThis fall, Democrats have struggled to push their legislative agenda through Congress. They’ve argued among themselves, put off votes, and radically trimmed bills to try to get past the fact that their margin in the House is tissue-thin and in the Senate barely exists. But what if, in terms of political power, this is as good as it gets for the Democratic Party for years to come? What if, electorally-speaking, they are doomed?  That’s a discussion that’s exploded among party activists and officials in recent days as they take a...
__label__5 California prepares to bury 10,000 miles of power lines as wildfires force new evacuationsA northern California wildfire crossed into Nevada, prompting new evacuations, but better weather has been helping crews battling the nation’s largest blaze in southern Oregon. Meanwhile, the major California utility provider PG&E has announced a multibillion-dollar effort to bury 10,000 miles (16,000km) of its power lines, after its electrical equipment was once again blamed for igniting a separate, fast-growing fire in the state’s north-east. There are dozens of fires burning across the American west. The Tamarack fire, which crossed into Nevada, is burning south of Lake Tahoe and had burned more than...
__label__3 CNN Fact Checks Biden’s Town Hall But Neglects Claim That Multi-Trillion-Dollar Agenda Will Cost $0President Joe Biden made some false claims at his town hall with moderator Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, prompting the CNN Newsroom to fact check a few of his statements. Responding to concerns about the southern border Biden stated, “I’ve been there before. I know it well.”  Later, he conceded, “I guess I should go down but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole lot of time to get down.”   CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pushed back against this claim, stating that he “could not find any...
__label__2 Why can’t Biden be the next LBJ or FDR? It comes down to math.He was a man of the Senate, a skilled legislator who rose to the vice presidency under a much younger, more charismatic president. Upon assuming the Oval Office in his own right, he knew that his time to accomplish big things was limited – and he swung for the fences. That president was Lyndon B.

The blaze torched close to 23,000 acres (9,300 hectares), destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings, and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton. Refugio Manuel Jimenez Jr and Angela Renee Jimenez were indicted for 30 crimes including involuntary manslaughter, said Jason Anderson, the San Bernardino county district attorney, during a press conference. The couple pleaded not guilty and were released to await their court...
__label__3 Yes, Biden Is Proposing That the IRS Spy on Your Bank RecordsOPINIONHere’s yet another example of why “fact-checking” is the most dishonest form of journalism. To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...
__label__2 Democrats see political peril in replacing Minneapolis PDAs activists mobilized this summer to ask Minneapolis voters to replace their police department, one of the first prominent Democrats to slam the plan was a moderate congresswoman who doesn’t even live in the city. Angie Craig declared it “shortsighted, misguided and likely to harm the very communities that it seeks to protect.” She warned that it could push out the city’s popular Black police chief. Craig’s district covers a suburban-to-rural and politically divided region south of the city, but her willingness to jump into the fight next door highlights...

Xu said seven people are missing.
__label__3 Majority of Americans Blame Biden’s Policies for Rising InflationA majority of Americans blame the Biden administration’s policies for rising inflation, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday.In answer to the question “to what extent” do they think “the Biden administration’s policies” are responsible for rising inflation, 62 percent of respondents blamed the administration’s policies. Of those, 40 percent of respondents said those policies are “very responsible” for inflation while 22 percent said “somewhat responsible.”
__label__2 Democrats Aim to Keep Government Funded as Talks Continue on $3.5 Trillion BillDemocrats raced to both avoid a government shutdown and salvage President Biden’s domestic agenda on Capitol Hill, with the Senate preparing to take up a short-term funding patch and advance one of the fiscal priorities lawmakers are weighing simultaneously. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said that the chamber could vote as early as later Wednesday on a stand-alone measure extending government funding, currently set to expire on Friday at 12:01 a.m., through Dec. 3. Such a measure would likely garner GOP support, allowing it to quickly pass both...
__label__5 Wind and lightning complicate Bootleg fire as 80 blazes burn across 13 statesErratic winds and dry lightning added to dangers for crews battling the largest US wildfire on Monday in parched Oregon forests, just one of 80 large fires burning across 13 US states. The destructive Bootleg fire, one of the largest in modern Oregon history, has burned more than 476 sq miles (1,210 sq km), an area about the size of Los Angeles. The blaze just north of the California state line was 25% contained. Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather through at least Monday with lightning possible in California and southern Oregon. “We...
__label__3 7 Ways Democrats’ $3.5 Trillion Tax-and-Spend Bill Would Take Over Your Health CareOPINIONAs a senior fellow in health policy, Nina Owcharenko Schaefer helps develop The Heritage Foundation’s research and policy prescriptions on such issues as health care reform on the federal and state levels, Medicare and Medicaid, children’s health and prescription drugs. Read her research. Slimming down the cost of the Democrats’ massive $3.5 trillion social-welfare spending bill is a compromise that misses the point. Opposition to the tax-and-spending bill is not just about cost, it’s about a policy agenda that shifts more power and control to the federal government and away from...
__label__1 America’s Infrastructure Struggles With New Weather ForecastA 22-foot-high floodwall was supposed to protect Aqua Pennsylvania’s water-treatment facility near the Schuylkill River from a 100-year storm. But when the remains of Hurricane Ida barreled through the area near Philadelphia in September, the 18-inch-thick wall proved no match for the record rains. Waters breached the barrier and inundated the plant. Mud and debris coated offices. Employees rushed to shut down the facility. They barely got out in time, some rolling down car windows in case they got caught in the rising waters and had to leap out, said Chris Franklin,...

__label__3 Under Biden Administration Plan, Poor Would Be Three Times More Likely To Get IRS Audit Than 1 PercentersUnder a new Biden administration proposal, the Internal Revenue Service is three times more likely to audit a citizen making less than $25,000 rather than someone in the top 1 percent of wealth. The new proposal, which would require financial institutions to annually report customers’ account deposits and withdrawals at $600 or more, gives the IRS more leverage over those making less than $25,000, because they are more likely to have irregular income. Over the next decade, the reporting on more than 140 million bank accounts would raise an estimated $700 billion in tax revenue — which would...
__label__1 Ocean drone caught inside Hurricane Sam captures hair-raising videoHurricane Sam is the strongest storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season so far, though it's fortunately not threatening to make landfall. While we've seen Sam churning from orbit, we now have some extraordinary new footage from inside the Category 4 storm. Autonomous ocean vehicle company Saildrone is working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to monitor the storm from an unusual vantage point. On Thursday, Saildrone shared a video taken by its Saildrone Explorer SD 1045. The video shows heaving waves at stomach-turning angles as witnessed by the drone ship.

__label__5 These Photos Show The Devastation Of The Floods In Germany That Have Killed Over 100 PeopleMore than 100 people have been killed by floods in Germany after extreme rainfall caused rivers to overflow in the western part of the country on Thursday, and the toll is expected to increase as the floodwaters recede. Dozens have also been killed in neighboring Belgium and the Netherlands. Rescue operations are ongoing as hundreds of people are still listed as missing, although officials hope the number will decrease as communications are restored. According to the Associated Press, dozens of residents were rescued from their roofs, where they had taken...
__label__3 Dems Want to Soak the Rich by Snooping on the PoorOPINIONHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) snapped when asked Tuesday if the proposal to dramatically increase the surveillance capabilities of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would remain in the trillion-dollar social spending bill currently being negotiated among Democrats on Capitol Hill. "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes," the speaker said. Then she waved aside the questioner's accurate comment that banks have reported customer concerns about the idea that the IRS would scrutinize accounts with inflows and outflows as low as $600. "With all due respect, the plural of anecdote is not data," Pelosi said, disrespectfully. "Yes, there are...
__label__2 Tropical storm Nicholas brings heavy rain to Texas and LouisianaTropical storm Nicholas has been downgraded from a hurricane after making landfall on the Texas coast in the US, bringing heavy rain and the risk of life-threatening flooding. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane after reaching land at 00:30 (05:30 GMT), but has now weakened. More than 360,000 power outages have been reported in Texas, according to PowerOutage.us. President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Louisiana. It comes just weeks after Hurricane Ida - the fifth strongest to ever hit the US mainland - killed dozens and left more than a million...
__label__4 It Seems Odd That We Would Just Let the World BurnOPINIONI spent the weekend reading a book I wasn’t entirely comfortable being seen with in public. Andreas Malm’s “How to Blow Up a Pipeline” is only slightly inaptly named. You won’t find, anywhere inside, instructions on sabotaging energy infrastructure. A truer title would be “Why to Blow Up a Pipeline.” On this, Malm’s case is straightforward: Because nothing else has worked. Decades of climate activism have gotten millions of people into the streets but they haven’t turned the tide on emissions, or even investments. Citing a 2019 study in the journal Nature,...
__label__3 Why Biden’s Infrastructure Bill Will Likely Only Worsen Supply Chain CrisisOPINIONPresident Joe Biden on Nov. 15 signed his infrastructure bill, a trillion-plus-dollar handout to left-wing special interests masquerading as a solution to the supply chain crisis he created. The administration is touting the bill as a fix, but the truth is, the bill is at best irrelevant, and most likely will make the crisis worse, at an enormous cost to taxpayers. The core of the supply chain crisis is a lack of capacity at ports and among truckers—and a historic shortage of workers, now at 10.4 million unfilled jobs nationwide. Together, these shortages drive inflation, empty...
__label__2 After Ida: Power outages, calls for aid ... and sighs of reliefVast stretches of Louisiana lacked electric power after one of the strongest hurricanes in the nation’s recorded history made landfall Sunday accompanied by major rains as well as winds of 150 mph. The storm’s surge was so powerful that it reversed the flow of the Mississippi River, but it was not strong enough to break the will of some New Orleans residents.  In particular, residents of the city’s Lower Ninth Ward, which captured national attention as it was swamped by a levee failure following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, were grateful...
__label__5 On Chicago’s West Side, Urgent Needs Collide With Washington CompromisesDemocrats in Washington want to talk about what has made it into President Biden’s domestic legislation. Chris Brown on Chicago’s West Side wants to talk about what has been cut. For many in the North Lawndale neighborhood, affordable housing has a direct link to curbing gun violence in the area, where five people were shot near an elementary school this year. One proposed solution — which includes building thousands of homes and rehabbing vacant lots — could hinge on how much federal investment makes it from the halls of the Capitol to...
__label__3 Thank the Government for the High Price of Holiday MealsOPINIONAs we head into the holidays, part of the season's cheer will be tarnished by the higher prices we'll all pay for holiday festivities. In fact, food, like many goods and services, is costing us more as the flood of dollars unleashed by the federal government diminishes their value, ensuring our money doesn't go as far as it once did. If you're looking for a relative bright spot, count yourself lucky as an American, because things could be worse: Around the world, people generally far less prosperous than those in...
__label__2 Hurricane Ida: New Orleans loses power as storm strikesThe US city of New Orleans has lost power, with only generators working, as Hurricane Ida batters Louisiana. The storm brought 150mph (240km/h) winds when it made landfall and those people who did not flee have been advised to shelter in place. One person was killed when a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in the Baton Rouge area. Ida will test New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened after Hurricane Katrina killed 1,800 people in 2005. President Joe Biden said Ida would be "life-threatening", with immense devastation likely beyond...
__label__5 Republicans at Odds Over Infrastructure Bill as Vote ApproachesBusiness groups and some Senate Republicans — working at cross-purposes with Republican leaders in the House — have mounted an all-out drive to secure G.O.P. votes for a bipartisan infrastructure bill ahead of a final vote on Thursday. Although the measure is the product of a compromise among moderates in both parties, House Republican leaders are leaning on their members to reject the $1 trillion infrastructure bill by disparaging its contents and arguing that it will only pave the way for Democrats to push through their far larger climate change...
__label__3 Psaki Says Inflation Is Being Used As A ‘Political Cudgel’White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that inflation is being utilized as a “political cudgel” and predicted that it will decrease next year. During a press briefing on Friday, Psaki was asked about the administration’s view on rising price levels — which are now accelerating at a 6.2% year-over-year rate. “One in four Americans, according to a new survey, have experienced some kind of loss of income as a result of higher prices,” noted one reporter. “The president has expressed concern about this. I know that you were working on different...
__label__2 Ida Batters Louisiana, Leaving New Orleans Without PowerHurricane Ida made landfall on Sunday and battered this city and much of southeast Louisiana, knocking out power, downing trees and causing havoc as the region’s most severe storm since Hurricane Katrina exactly 16 years earlier. Ida arrived at Port Fourchon, 60 miles south of New Orleans, at midday. It was a Category 4 hurricane, the second-highest storm classification. It brought pounding rain, sustained winds of 150 miles an hour and dangerous sea surges. All of New Orleans had lost power by Sunday night, an Entergy spokesman confirmed. More than 1 million...

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to authorize $110 billion for new roads and $39 billion for public transit, among many other provisions.
__label__3 Team Biden and its media apologists blame you for supply shortages the White House refuses to fixOPINIONWorried about the shortages of goods due to the supply chain crisis? You’re right to be. But instead of fixing the problem, President Joe Biden and his team are blaming you for it — and telling Americans to just suck it up. It’s outrageous. And short-sighted. The images of hundreds of cargo ships waiting to be unloaded isn’t one of those economic issues ordinary people have a hard time understanding. The inability of the transportation system to handle the flow of goods shipped from manufacturers is threatening to not only make it harder to get...
__label__1 Behind The Florida Condo Collapse: Rampant Corner-CuttingA startling discovery awaited an engineer who drilled into the ground-level concrete slab at Champlain Towers South last year. He could find no waterproofing in two separate sections, the engineer wrote in a letter to the condominium board. Without that essential layer for a high rise facing the punishing Atlantic Ocean, rainwater and salty sea spray likely had seeped in for decades, slowly weakening the steel rebar and concrete holding up the condo building. Indeed, the engineer reported at the time seeing significant concrete deterioration. Less than a year later,...
__label__4 GOP senators say they've reached agreement on "major issues" in infrastructure billFive Republican senators negotiating the bipartisan infrastructure framework said Wednesday they have reached an agreement on the "major issues" of the bill with Senate Democrats and the White House, potentially capping weeks of talks that at times appeared on the brink of collapse. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who has been leading negotiations for Republicans, announced the breakthrough after meeting with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and four other Republican senators. A vote to advance the measure would require 60 votes, meaning 10 Republicans would have to join all Democrats in voting...

Rains from the storm, which spared coastal areas of New York and New England major damage when its center made landfall Sunday in Rhode Island as a tropical storm, deluged areas from New Hampshire to New York City and down to New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Downpours, flooding and even tornadoes were possible Monday in New England, where officials fretted that...

__label__2 New England Is Facing Its 1st Direct Hurricane Landfall In 30 YearsThe National Hurricane Center has issued a rare hurricane watch for parts of New England, warning that Tropical Storm Henri will likely develop into a hurricane before making landfall on the northeastern U.S. coast this weekend. "If Henri strikes southeast New England as a hurricane this weekend, it will be the first direct hurricane landfall since Bob in 1991," National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesman Chris Vaccaro told NPR. Henri's maximum sustained winds grew to 70 mph on Friday, making it "almost a hurricane," the NHC said in its 2 p.m. ET...

__label__3 GDP Grows Just 2% in Third Quarter, Falling Short of Diminished ExpectationsU.S. economic growth crashed in the third quarter, as the economy grappled with the Delta variant driving a resurgence of Covid-19 infections and supply-chain disruptions. Gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S.—grew at an annualized rate of two percent from July through September, after adjusting for inflation and seasonality, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was below the consensus expectation for 2.9 percent growth. The economy grew at a better than expected 6.7 percent in the second quarter, boosted by widespread business reopenings, vaccinated Americans...
__label__1 Tropical Storm Henri poses uniquely dangerous threat to New EnglandTropical Storm Henri, currently spinning its way west-northwest about 320 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, is likely to become the first hurricane to make landfall in southern New England in 30 years. Why it matters: Factors ranging from soggy soils from previous rainstorms to astronomical high tides, and Henri's slow forward motion will combine to create a uniquely dangerous scenario for New England beginning Sunday and lasting through at least Monday. Driving the news: Tropical Storm Henri has survived a battle with strong upper level winds that have tipped over...
__label__5 "We have a deal": Biden announces bipartisan compromise on infrastructurePresident Joe Biden threw his support behind an infrastructure proposal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, boosting momentum for the deal even as congressional leadership also presses forward with a larger bill addressing the more ambitious aspects of the president's agenda."We have a deal," Mr. Biden told reporters outside the White House after a meeting with the 11 senators of both parties who had negotiated the package. "We made serious compromises on both ends."
__label__3 Vaccine Mandate Threatens Major Trucking Disruption, Industry Insiders SayAmerican truckers don’t like taking orders. But the Biden administration has increased pressure on some of them to take the vaccine—willing or unwilling. All through the pandemic, truckers endured hardships to keep America’s infrastructure running. They waited in line for hours in sight of bathrooms they weren’t allowed to use. On the road, some died alone of COVID-19. Now, with supply chains disrupted, Americans need them more than ever. But faced with the prospect of mandated vaccination, many drivers are considering quitting. “I’d fight it,” said veteran trucker Mike Widdins,...

Storms leave Louisiana city facing tough choices.With weather events like hurricanes growing more severe, a rising number of people are being forced from their homes by winds and rain. A key question is what happens after that. After back-to-back storms struck southwest Louisiana last year, Monty and Nashonna Aucoin were left without a home to return to. Many of their friends and family, in a similar position, decided not to go back, citing the exhausting rebuilding process that lay ahead.  But the Aucoin’s have a different plan.

__label__5 Is Biden Setting Harris Up to Fail?ANALYSISIf you look at the assignments Kamala Harris has been given during her tenure as vice president, it’s pretty easy to think that she’s getting the short end of the political stick. First, she was tasked with taking on immigration: After mostly staying in D.C. during the pandemic, Harris is on her first international trip, a visit aimed at helping Guatemala and Mexico stem migration. She’s also been assigned to help protect voting rights that are under attack across the country. It’s hard to know what to call her job, why...

__label__3 Beat the Supply Chain Crisis With Smart InvestmentsOPINIONPresident Biden’s recent announcement that he struck a deal with one of the nation’s largest ports to increase output and alleviate our nation’s growing supply chain crisis is nothing more than a headline. It’s a pebble tossed in a fast-moving river. Alas, even the positive spin Team Biden hoped to gain from that event was quickly overshadowed by the news that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg — the government official charged with keeping his eye on this exact ball — has quietly been absent from his office since mid-August.

Why it matters: Extreme heat can kill, and it can also greatly aggravate wildfire conditions, making it even harder for thousands of firefighters to contain California's Dixie Fire, the state's second-largest on record. Although it is summer, it's unusual to see so much of the Lower 48 states experiencing extreme heat simultaneously. The big picture: An area of upper level high pressure, also known as a heat dome, is...

__label__2 Wildfires in U.S., Siberia are unusually intense, setting emissions recordsWildfires across parts of the U.S. and Canada are burning unusually intensely and emitting larger amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than typical during midsummer, scientists say. Massive blazes in Siberia are also adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, while contributing to local air pollution. Why it matters: The fires are thriving in areas experiencing extreme heat and drought conditions. They are both a consequence of climate change and an accelerant of global warming. Driving the news: About 300 wildfires are burning in British Columbia alone, and about 80 large fires are burning in the West. In Siberia,...
__label__4 Americans 'want to see us get it done': Buttigieg on Biden's infrastructure planSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said Sunday that he believes it could be possible to get Republicans on board with President Joe Biden's massive, $2 trillion infrastructure bill that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said he plans to fight "every step of the way." "I'm having a lot of conversations with Republicans in the House and Senate, who have been wanting to do something big on infrastructure for years. We may not agree about every piece of it, but this is one area where the American people absolutely...
__label__3 Unions Have Made Supply-Chain Problems WorseANALYSISOrganized-labor headlines typically offer a zap of top-line shock — UPS is paying some drivers $134,000 a year? Philadelphia is paying a police detective $310,000 a year? — but those six-figure sums don’t capture the true cost. As can be seen with the enormously costly backup at the port complex in San Pedro, Calif. — which handles about 40 percent of U.S. container-ship cargo — the issue is not so much high wages as highly rigid and inflexible labor practices. The problem in San Pedro isn’t that the longshoremen are earning, on average,...
__label__2 Western wildfire smoke chokes Upper Midwest, East CoastSmoke from the wildfires engulfing the U.S. West and Canada and carrying harmful air pollution has triggered air quality alerts in the Upper Midwest and East Coast cities including New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Driving the news: The coast to coast smoke, which is clearly visible from space, is due to the nearly 300 wildfires burning in British Columbia and the more than 80 large blazes in the U.S. The towering pyrocumulus clouds coming off these fires is lofting smoke all the way into the stratosphere, and the...
__label__5 Inflation emerges as a 2022 campaign dividing lineTight congressional races across the nation are quickly turning into battlegrounds over a key economic question: whether President Joe Biden’s spending agenda is the chief culprit for inflation concerns gripping the country. Republicans are latching onto heightened anxiety tied to the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in three decades. Democrats, meanwhile, are scrambling to preempt the attacks by focusing on broader benefits of the multitrillion-dollar packages. The opposing bets on the infrastructure and social spending plans are laying the groundwork for a year of sparring tied to voters’ growing worries about...
__label__3 Keeping Warm This Winter Could Be More Costly As Inflation Heats UpRising inflation and higher demand for fuel mean most Americans will see big increases in their winter heating bills this year, the U.S. Department of Energy warns in a report released Wednesday. About half of American households rely on natural gas for heat, and they will pay about 30 percent more for heat than last year—and perhaps as much as 50 percent more if the winter is 10 percent colder than expected, the department estimates. That means the average family that relies on natural gas to stay warm this winter will shell out $746...
__label__2 Largest fire grows, forces evacuation of wildlife stationThe nation’s largest wildfire torched more dry forest in Oregon and forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station Monday as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Firefighters were forced to pull back as flames, pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions, jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said. The destructive Bootleg Fire in south-central Oregon is just north of the California border and grew to more than...
__label__4 Why the Fed’s only Democrat could unseat the current chairANALYSISNearing a decision on who should lead the Federal Reserve, President Biden brought two contenders into the White House last week: the current chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Fed governor Lael Brainard. White House officials have stayed in touch with Brainard since her meeting with Biden, and the administration emphasizes that no final decision has been made. But the conversations underscore how the White House could be looking to make a change by picking Brainard for one of the world’s most powerful policymaking roles, despite Powell’s popularity and his record steering the economy out of the...
__label__3 Rep. Jim Jordan: Email Shows FBI Using ‘Counterterrorism Tools’ Against ‘Concerned Parents’The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee is asking Attorney General Merrick Garland about his October testimony to that same committee, citing a document unearthed by a whistleblower that shows the FBI started using a specific tag to track threats related to schools. “We are now in receipt of a protected disclosure from a [Justice] Department whistleblower showing that the FBI’s counterterrorism division is compiling and categorizing threat assessments related to parents, including a document directing FBI personnel to use a specific ‘threat tag’ to track potential investigations,” writes Rep. Jim...
__label__2 CDC: Northwest heat wave led to major spike in emergency room visitsThe unprecedented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest led to a major spike in emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses, according to a report published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why it matters: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S. during a typical year, and climate change is dramatically raising the risk of such events. Multiple all-time temperature records were shattered during the late June into early July heat wave in the Pacific Northwest. During the event, Seattle hit an all-time record high of 108°F, while Portland hit...
__label__4 US must rethink attitude to parental leave, Pete Buttigieg saysThe US needs a fundamental rethink of its attitudes towards parenting, according to Pete Buttigieg, who was the target of criticism from conservatives for taking leave to care for his newborn children. Buttigieg, the US transport secretary, came under attack after he took time to help care for his newborn twins, a boy and a girl, in August. Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said Buttigieg was “absent during a transportation crisis” while Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, told his audience: “Pete Buttigieg has been on leave from his job...

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, has called for an investigation into criminal activity due to the availability of pornographic content in the state’s public schools.Abbott directed his request to the Texas Education Agency."NEW: Directing @TEAinfo to investigate any criminal activity in public schools related to the availability of pornographic material & to report such instances for prosecution to the fullest extent of the law," Abbott tweeted Wednesday morning.
__label__1 Infrastructure bill unleashes funding to address risky damsStates will soon be flooded with federal money to address a pent-up need to repair, improve or remove thousands of aging dams across the U.S., including some that could inundate towns or neighborhoods if they fail. The roughly $3 billion for dam-related projects pales in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars going to roads, rails and high-speed internet in the $1 trillion infrastructure plan signed Monday by President Joe Biden. But it’s a lot more than dam projects had been getting. The money could give “a good kick-start to...
__label__4 On Chicago’s West Side, Urgent Needs Collide With Washington CompromisesDemocrats in Washington want to talk about what has made it into President Biden’s domestic legislation. Chris Brown on Chicago’s West Side wants to talk about what has been cut. For many in the North Lawndale neighborhood, affordable housing has a direct link to curbing gun violence in the area, where five people were shot near an elementary school this year. One proposed solution — which includes building thousands of homes and rehabbing vacant lots — could hinge on how much federal investment makes it from the halls of the Capitol to...
__label__3 Eric Adams says he wants to end NYC’s school mask mandate, calls himself ‘conservative’ on crimeMayor-elect Eric Adams took to the airwaves Sunday and declared he wants to nix mask mandates in the classroom and called himself “conservative” on public safety. Adams fears masks are stopping students from making friends and said he wants to end the school mask mandate when he takes office come Jan. 1. “If we can find a safe way to do it, I look forward to getting rid of the mask,” Adams told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday morning. “Part of the socialization of a child is that...

__label__4 Progressives Helped Biden Pass His Infrastructure Bill. But They Gave Up Their Leverage.ANALYSISHouse progressives backed down on Friday, giving President Joe Biden a chance to claim a win—even as his party’s hopes of enacting a broader agenda wobbled. In remarks Saturday morning, Biden said that the infrastructure bill will create millions of jobs. “Yesterday we took a monumental step forward as a nation,” he said. “And we’re just getting started.” Progressives permitted passage of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill without assurance that the bigger prize they have spent months holding out for—a far-reaching package of climate, family and health provisions—will also become law....
__label__2 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__1 Here's What's Included In The Bipartisan Infrastructure BillSenators announced the long-awaited text of a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package Sunday night over a month after President Biden and a bipartisan group of senators first announced such a deal. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act focuses on investments in roads, railways, bridges and broadband internet, but it does not include investments that Biden has referred to as "human infrastructure," including money allocated for child care and tax credits for families. Democrats are looking to address those priorities separately. The package calls for $550 billion in new spending over five years.
__label__4 How These Ultrawealthy Politicians Avoided Paying TaxesAs a member of Congress, Jared Polis was one of the loudest Democrats demanding President Donald Trump release his tax returns. At a rally in Denver in 2017, he warned the crowd that Trump “might have something to hide.” That same year, on the floor of the House, he introduced a resolution to force the president to release the records, calling them an “important baseline disclosure.” But during Polis’ successful run for governor of Colorado in 2018, his calls for transparency faded. The dot-com tycoon turned investor broke with recent...
__label__3 Inflating Grades For Social JusticeOPINIONAt a party over the weekend I was introduced to a college professor, and fell into conversation with him about teaching and Covid. Then I asked about how wokeness affects his teaching. I had no idea of the man’s politics, but I would bet the farm that he is a liberal, given that his academic field skews heavily to the left. He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...
__label__1 Infrastructure costs billions. Who should pay for it?President Biden and a bipartisan group of senators announced last week that they reached a deal on an infrastructure bill. The $1.2 trillion plan, which includes $579 billion in new spending, will largely focus on America’s physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, airports and public transportation. The bill will have to overcome heavy political headwinds if it is going to pass through Congress, but it still marks a significant step forward in a lengthy negotiating process that left many in Washington questioning whether a bipartisan deal was even possible. One of the...
__label__4 There’s No Reason for Progressives to Vote for the Watered-Down Infrastructure BillOPINIONThe perennial dilemma for congressional progressives has always been that while they have a working moral conscience, their opponents don’t. This fundamental quandary is at work yet again, as progressives, after gamely holding the line for months on the Democrats’ infrastructure bills, are now coming under intense pressure to swallow another loss, smile, and say thank you. As Senator Joe Manchin, the public face of the corporate-funded wrecking ball that’s been taken to the party’s once-ambitious plans, reportedly told Bernie Sanders behind closed doors, he’s willing to go without any of the reconciliation...
__label__3 MIT Canceled a Professor's Guest Lecture Because He Opposes Race-Based AdmissionsANALYSISDorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...
__label__2 Graham calls Democrats' dual-track infrastructure plan "extortion"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Politico Thursday that he will not support the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal that President Biden struck with 10 senators, after Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded it be passed alongside a budget resolution with key Democratic priorities. Why it matters: The bipartisan infrastructure bill needs every Democrat and 10 GOP votes — meaning five more than the number of Republicans that have already signed on — in order to overcome a legislative filibuster in the Senate. Graham originally signed onto the original bipartisan infrastructure framework, but is now...
__label__5 Deficit shrinks in the first year of Joe Biden's presidencyANALYSISWhen it comes to the deficit, Americans have endured a remarkably consistent pattern for four decades. It starts with a Republican presidential candidate denouncing the deficit and vowing to balance the budget if elected. That Republican then takes office, abandons interest in the issue, and expresses indifference when the deficit becomes vastly larger. Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize. During the Democratic administration, the...
__label__3 420,000 homeless kids went missing from schools’ rolls last year. They may never be foundANALYSISA week before school started in the sunny desert city of St. George, Utah, Mike Carr waited at the front desk of the only emergency youth shelter in this southern Utah county. He noticed a young mother on a sectional couch in the living room swaddling her infant in a pink blanket, idly watching a Marvel movie. In the neighboring kitchen, some teenagers — each a potential student that Carr hoped to talk to — prepared lunch before retiring to one of the shelter’s 15 beds. Carr runs a one-person...
__label__2 Bipartisan infrastructure deal omits major climate change measuresWhite House negotiators and a group of senators struck a deal on a bipartisan infrastructure agreement on Thursday that slashes measures to combat climate change and help the U.S. transition to a clean energy economy. The narrow infrastructure deal leaves President Joe Biden’s proposals on climate change to a separate bill that Democrats could attempt to pass through Congress using reconciliation, a process that doesn’t require Republican support. The second package could also include programs related to child and elder care, education, and health care, in addition to climate change measures, issues that administration officials...
__label__5 The World ‘Has Found a Way to Do This’: The U.S. Lags on Paid LeaveANALYSISCongress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave. But it would still be an outlier. Of the 185 countries that offer paid leave for new mothers, only one, Eswatini (once called Swaziland), offers fewer than four weeks. Of the...
__label__3 Leaked Docs: Prestigious DC School Poised To Crack Down on ‘Harmful’ HumorStudents at one of the oldest and most prestigious boys schools in the United States could soon face expulsion for a single "misplaced" joke, according to a draft "anti-bias" policy circulating among school administrators and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. St. Albans, whose alumni include vice presidents and two current U.S. senators, is considering a crackdown on "harmful" speech that prioritizes the impact of the speech rather than the intent of the speaker. "It is the impact of hate speech, rather than the intent of those perpetrating it, that is...
__label__2 Centrists gain leverage over progressives in Senate infrastructure battleCentrists have gained leverage in the Senate battle over an infrastructure package after 11 more senators backed a $974 billion infrastructure framework. Twenty-one senators in all are supporting the proposal, which is much smaller than what the White House and liberals prefer. The group includes 11 Republicans, nine Democrats and an independent who caucuses with Democrats. Liberals who were calling on fellow Democrats to “cut bait” only a few days ago now grudgingly acknowledge they will have to review the details of what the centrists will come up with before...
__label__4 Where President Biden’s economic plan appears to stand right now: From taxes to climate policy to Medicare to immigrationEven as negotiations over President Biden’s economic package continue, Democratic officials have started signaling which parts of the White House agenda could be cut from the legislation and which are likely to be approved. Biden, for instance, said on Thursday night that his plan to create universal free community college had fallen out of the bill. The president acknowledged his new clean energy plan to incentivize utility firms to move away from fossil fuels is in danger of being jettisoned. By contrast, universal prekindergarten and a national child care program...
__label__3 'Domestic Terrorism'? Biden's AG Tells FBI to Protect School Boards from Parent ProtestersU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has directed the FBI to work with law enforcement to protect school board members, teachers, and other public school employees after some rowdy parent protests. Garland's order comes after numerous school board meetings across the country erupted in chaos as parents voiced their concerns about serious issues, including the teaching of Critical Race Theory, transgender policies, graphic sexual content, and pandemic restrictions like mask mandates. Those debates have led parents and board members to face off in heated discussions and angry outbursts. 'You Are Predators':...
__label__2 Ohio sues Google, seeks to declare the internet company a public utilityOhio Attorney General Dave Yost has filed a lawsuit asking a court to declare Google a public utility that should be regulated as such. "Google uses its dominance of internet search to steer Ohioans to Google’s own products – that's discriminatory and anti-competitive," Yost said in a statement. "When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access." The lawsuit, filed in Delaware County Common Pleas Court, is believed to be the first of its kind, Yost's office said....
__label__4 White House, Dems hurriedly reworking $2 trillion Biden planThe White House and Democrats are hurriedly reworking key aspects of President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion domestic policy plan, trimming the social services and climate change programs and rethinking new taxes on corporations and the wealthy to pay for a scaled-back package. The changes come as Biden more forcefully appeals to the American public, including in a televised town hall Thursday evening, for what he says are the middle-class values at the heart of his proposal. As long-sought programs are adjusted or eliminated, Democratic leaders are showing great deference to Biden’s preferences to swiftly wrap...
__label__3 Teachers Union Boss Accidentally Endorses School Choice While Rushing To Support Masking in SchoolsANALYSISThe performative politics of mask mandates have produced some weird moments during the pandemic. Now, they've even managed to get a prominent teachers union boss to argue in favor of school choice. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, on Monday night tweeted out a story from the Detroit News about how parents are navigating the complexities of some school districts in Michigan mandating that children wear masks in the classroom while others don't. At the center of the story is a mother, Janine Fogg, who recently pulled her kids out of public schools in Brighton,...
__label__2 Biden eyes 15% minimum corporate tax rate to pay for infrastructurePresident Joe Biden has proposed focusing on a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, as well as increased Internal Revenue Service funding, as a way to to pay for a possible infrastructure package, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Thursday. Driving the news: The proposal could could help negotiations with Senate Republicans. Biden made the offer in his meeting yesterday with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R- W.Va.) who is leading a group of GOP centrists trying to find a compromise on infrastructure spending. The Washington Post first reported Biden’s new offer, couching...
__label__4 The Federal Government Gave Billions to America’s Schools for COVID-19 Relief. Where Did the Money Go?After the pandemic shut down schools across the country, the federal government provided about $190 billion in aid to help them reopen and respond to the effects of the pandemic. In the year and a half since millions of children were sent home, the Education Department has done only limited tracking of how the money has been spent. That has left officials in Washington largely in the dark about how effective the aid has been in helping students, especially those whose schools and communities were among the hardest hit by the pandemic....
__label__3 Washington state school required White privilege training for teachersA Washington state public high school required its teachers in 2018 to undergo mandatory training in White, heterosexual male privilege. The suburban Tumwater School District, southwest of Tacoma, hired a consultant to help the predominantly White high school faculty “examine our privilege” and learn about microaggressions at a two-hour, in-service session, according to a teacher who anonymously sent materials to the conservative advocacy group Parents Defending Education (PDE) on Aug. 4. “Because everyone was terrified to contribute to the discussion we were supposed to be having, lest we offend someone...
__label__2 Biden, GOP senator to meet as infrastructure deadline loomsDeadline looming, President Joe Biden is set to meet with the top Senate Republican negotiator on infrastructure as the administration signals time is running out to strike a bipartisan deal on the White House’s big investment proposal and top legislative priority. The president is looking forward to hosting West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the White House said ahead of the Wednesday afternoon session. The two will continue bipartisan negotiations. The administration’s deadline for a deal is now June. 7. Privately, however, the president has sized up the GOP’s latest $928...
__label__5 Will Banks Have To Report All Transactions Over $600 to IRS Under Biden Plan?ANALYSISClaim: The Biden Administration’s American Families Plan proposes that financial institutions report all transactions from personal and business accounts except those below $600. Rating: Mixture What's True: According to the proposed American Families Plan, banks would “report gross inflows and outflows” for all business and personal accounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), “with the exception of accounts below a 'low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600.'” But ... ... this does not mean all individual transactions above that threshold would be reported....
__label__3 Students in this state don’t have to quarantine after COVID-19 exposureFlorida students do not have to quarantine after they are exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, leaving the decision up to individual families. Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the newly-appointed surgeon general for Florida, signed new protocols for the state that allows parents to decide whether their children should quarantine after COVID-19 exposure or stay in school, according to NPR. Ladapo eliminated mandates that required students to quarantine for four days after they were exposed. The new guidelines allow for students to attend school “without restrictions or disparate treatment,” as long as they do...
__label__2 White House makes $1.7 trillion infrastructure counteroffer to Senate RepublicansWhite House aides working on a bipartisan infrastructure deal made a counteroffer on Friday to Republican senators, reducing their initial proposal by $600 billion. The latest offer would cost $1.7 trillion over a decade, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. In order to trim the original $2.3 trillion plan down to $1.7 trillion, the White House would reduce funding for rural broadband, as well as for bridges and roads. It would also shift funding for research and development, small businesses and supply chain improvements from this package over to...
__label__5 $2.7 Trillion in Crisis Savings Stay Hoarded by Wary ConsumersConsumers in Europe and the U.S. aren’t rushing to spend more than $2.7 trillion in savings socked away during the pandemic, dashing hopes for a consumption-fueled boost to economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. In the wake of lockdown easing during the northern hemisphere’s summer holiday season, excess savings in euro-area bank balances declined only marginally in August, and Italy still recorded an increase, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics. In the U.S. there has also been no drawdown, the figures show.  The absence of a consumption surge...
__label__3 Majority of parents believe distance learning caused their children to fall behind in school, survey findsA new survey has found that more than half of parents are concerned that their children have fallen behind as a result of remote learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the poll – which was released by USA Today and Ipsos last week – 55% of parents "believe online learning caused their children to fall behind in school." That’s up from May 2020, when 46% of parents felt the same way.  Many parents do believe their children will be able to make up lost progress, however, according to the survey. Ipsos found 67% of...
__label__2 White House: User fees for infrastructure deal would "violate" Biden's tax pledgeThe White House on Friday said that Republicans' idea to impose user fees for infrastructure spending would "violate" President Biden's promise not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 annually. What they're saying: "The president's pledge and his commitment, his line in the sand, his red line, whatever you want to call it, is that he will not raise taxes for people making less than $400,000 a year," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. "User fees that have been proposed out there would violate that." Driving the...
__label__4 Oil prices are finally falling. Thank China and Joe BidenANALYSISThe price of oil has shot up this fall, boosting profits for major producers but hurting the wallets of drivers who need to fill up their tanks. Just a few days back, gas prices in California hit their highest level ever. This week, however, some of the pressure has started to lift. What's happening: West Texas Intermediate futures, the US benchmark for oil prices, and Brent futures, the global benchmark, are now trading at their lowest levels in six weeks on signals that supply constraints could begin to ease soon. In the United...

Biden will commute via motorcade to the Alexandria campus every Tuesday and Thursday, and will even hold office hours. Secret service agents will be accompanying the first lady, who will wear a mask at all times when on campus, even though she is fully vaccinated, in accordance with the college's rules.  She said she welcomed the return to in-person teaching, adding that 'It's hard to learn on Zoom,' as...
__label__2 Bernie Sanders wants to constrain police union negotiating powersSen. Bernie Sanders told "Axios on HBO" he'd support legislation to prevent police unions from negotiating benefits and disciplinary procedures that shield law enforcement officers from accountability. Why it matters: Sanders is one of the most vocal supporters of organized labor in Congress. But powerful police unions have been a major obstacle to criminal justice reforms — and the killing of George Floyd has fueled a growing fight within the labor movement over the proper role of police unions. Over the years, they've established a web of benefits for their...
__label__5 Fewer boots, more slippers: How a shortage of shipping containers is changing what shows up on shelvesThe furniture giant Ikea is known for flattening tables, chairs and even beds into compact bundles that can be lugged home in car trunks and pickup beds. Now its executives are using that expertise to squeeze as many seasonal offerings as possible into massive metal boxes for ocean transport. They prioritized lightweight and pliable — pillows and throws, wine glasses and plates — and holiday perennials like children’s easels and toys, said Javier Quiñones, chief executive of Ikea U.S. The desks, chairs and home office accessories that were big sellers early in the...
__label__2 Perspective: Welcome to ‘woke’ universityOPINIONBefore 2020 began and life came to a screeching halt, it had grown obvious to observers of higher education trends that something very strange, even dangerous, was unfolding at universities across the country. Perhaps the peculiar situation first became evident in the fall of 2015, when a group of Yale University students surrounded one of their professors and berated him for failing to protect them from offensive ideas, screaming, “You have created space for violence” and “I am sick looking at you.” Maybe matters became clear when in early 2017 students at...
__label__2 Infrastructure Package May Be Delayed By $10,000 DeductionANALYSISThe new infrastructure package may be delayed by a $10,000 deduction. Here’s what you need to know—and what it could mean for your bank account. Infrastructure President Joe Biden’s new infrastructure package — a $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal — has met some opposition from an unlikely source: House Democrats. Members of the New York Congressional Delegation aren’t upset with the new infrastructure package. Rather, they’re potentially willing to oppose the infrastructure package based on this one thing: a cap on a $10,000 tax deduction that adversely affects residents of...
__label__4 As supply lines strain, some corporations rewrite production playbookThe pandemic caught Stanley Black & Decker midway through an overhaul of its 18-country supply chain. Executives at the toolmaker’s New Britain, Conn., headquarters already had shifted most production of heavy-duty industrial products closer to customers in the United States and Europe. But efforts to do the same with Stanley’s popular hand tools were unfinished when the coronavirus pandemic began disrupting global commerce. This year, as ports grew clogged, Stanley saw its freight bills jump by a factor of seven, endured months-long shipping delays and scrambled to obtain computer chips...
__label__3 School Investigates Teacher Who Said She Told Students to Pledge Allegiance to Pride FlagA California school district is investigating one of its teachers for encouraging students to pledge allegiance to the pride flag in place of the American flag, according to a viral video posted by the teacher and a district statement. Fox News identified the teacher as Kristin Pitzen of Newport-Mesa Unified School District in Orange County. In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...
__label__1 How bad is the census news for Democrats?The first numbers from the nation’s decennial census were published this week. On top of providing top-level figures about the U.S. population — which grew to 331,449,281 last year — census data is used to determine how many seats in the House of Representatives and how many Electoral College votes each state gets. The total number of House seats is capped at 435, meaning for one state to gain a seat, another state must lose one. Texas added 4 million new residents in the past 10 years and is the...
__label__4 A Record 4.4 Million Americans Quit Their Jobs in SeptemberAn unprecedented number of Americans quit their jobs in September, highlighting how persistent churn is undercutting employers’ efforts to fill a near-record level of vacancies. A record 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs in September, the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed Friday. Meanwhile, the number of available positions eased to 10.4 million. Incentivized by record wage gains and other attractive terms offered by employers desperate for talent, Americans are leaving their jobs in droves. That’s made it even more challenging for employers to fill...
__label__3 Families Are Fleeing Government-Run SchoolsANALYSISThis fall may be the biggest moment of truth for public education since the 1970s. After seeing enrollment in government-run K-12 schools decline by 3 percent in COVID-marred 2020–21 (including 13 percent for kindergarten and pre-K), all while homeschooling tripled, the $122 billion question facing this new school year is whether that defection is an aberration or inflection point.

__label__2 US agency seeks to speed up Native American land decisionsU.S. Interior Department officials on Tuesday moved to reverse policies adopted under former President Donald Trump that Native American leaders said were hindering efforts by tribes to establish, consolidate and govern their homelands. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland issued an order that allows regional Bureau of Indian Affairs officials to approve the transfer of private land that’s not on a designated reservation into federal trust for tribes. Putting land into trust gives the federal government legal title to the property, while allowing tribes or individual Native Americans to use it for...
__label__5 No, Workers Aren’t Striking Because of Vaccine MandatesOPINIONThere’s a meme traveling around conservative media that vaccine mandates are the cause of the ongoing strike wave. Although you certainly can find news stories here and there about someone quitting due to a vaccine mandate or a small-scale labor protest (such as a slowdown or sickout) due to the vaccine mandate, it is clearly not the case that opposition to the vaccine mandate is driving the much bigger labor market developments. The real driver is labor market tightness. Quits Quit rates and levels tend to move in lockstep with...
__label__3 State Bans on Critical Race Theory Won’t WorkOPINIONI knew we’d lost the day I met the superintendent of North Carolina’s schools in 2011. I was leading a nonprofit whose civics curriculum was a stark improvement over the mishmash that the state’s teachers were then using. The Legislature had recently passed the Founding Principles Act, which required North Carolina schools to teach concepts like property rights, due process and federalism. Unlike the textbooks then in use, our materials were loaded with facts and original documents, illuminating concepts that undergird the U.S. Constitution and its founding. We were offering...
__label__1 D.C. statehood: Advancing the cause of Democrats? Or democracy?Eleanor Holmes Norton’s family has been fighting for equality since the 1800s, when her great-grandfather escaped slavery to come work in Washington, D.C., but – as she puts it – “didn’t quite find his freedom.”  She grew up in segregated neighborhoods, went on to Yale Law School, and has represented the District of Columbia in Congress for 30 years. Yet as a delegate, she has never been allowed to vote on a piece of legislation – not even her recent bill to grant the district statehood, which would give...
__label__4 U.S. hiring rebounded in October, with 531,000 jobs addedAmerica’s employers stepped up their hiring in October, adding a solid 531,000 jobs, the most since July and a sign that the recovery from the pandemic recession may be overcoming a virus-induced slowdown. Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 4.6% last month, from 4.8% in September. That is a comparatively low level but still well above the pre-pandemic jobless rate of 3.5%. The economy’s emergence from the pandemic, by most measures, remains on course. Services companies in such areas as retail, banks and warehousing...
__label__3 Mom Rebels as Elementary School Creates ‘Black Classes’ to Segregate ChildrenA mother filed a federal complaint against her child’s Atlanta elementary school after students were reportedly separated into classes based on their race, her lawyer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Kira Posey filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights after learning her child and 11 other black students were placed into “black classes” at the Mary Lin Elementary School in Atlanta, Posey’s lawyer Sharese Shields said. Last spring, the school’s principal, Sharyn Briscoe, put the segregation policy in place, arguing the decision was beneficial to...
__label__2 Democrats Outline 'Care Infrastructure' Plan, With Paid Leave And Child CareCongressional Democrats are further expanding the definition of infrastructure with a plan to provide paid leave and family benefits for the vast majority of Americans. Democrats are specifically calling the proposal "care infrastructure," adding to a party-wide push to redefine infrastructure beyond physical projects like roads, bridges and waterways. Republicans have almost universally rejected this rebranding, but Democrats insist that infrastructure should refer to all of the systems that contribute to a thriving economy. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., is leading the effort along with members...

Amazon Is Threatening to Terminate Their Contracts.In September, the owner of a small delivery company in Minnesota received an email from Amazon threatening to end its contract to deliver packages for the e-commerce giant. The email said the company hadn’t been keeping up with route quotas set by Amazon.  “Amazon hereby notifies your company that your company is in breach of certain requirements of the Program Agreement,” the email said. “If your company fails to cure the breach, Amazon may terminate the Program Agreement and end the business relationship between Amazon and your company.” (The “program...
__label__3 Quinnipiac Poll: More Americans Want GOP to Win Control of Congress Next YearMore U.S. voters want Republicans to take control of Congress next year, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll. The Quinnipiac survey found that 46% of registered voters said they wanted Republicans to capture the House majority in 2022, with 41% preferring Democrats. A total of 16% did not offer an opinion. Independents overall, registered and nonregistered voters, prefer Republicans over Democrats winning control of the House by 41% to 31%. Regarding the Senate, 46% of registered voters said they wanted the GOP to take control of the upper chamber. A total of 42% hope...
__label__1 Biden Claims GOP Voters Support His Infrastructure Plan; Poll Shows They Don'tPresident Biden and his team have been making a simple case for why Republican elected officials should support his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan: Lawmakers might not like it, but their voters do. "Overwhelmingly, the majority of the American people — Democrats, Republicans and independents — support infrastructure investments that meets the moment," Biden said last week. "So, I urge the Congress: Listen to your constituents and, together, we can lay a foundation for an economy that works for everyone and allows America to remain the world leader." Biden and other...
__label__5 U.S. economy grew at annual rate of 2% in the third quarter, as delta variant pulled back progressThe U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, in the latest sign of how the recent delta variant of the coronavirus held back the economic recovery. The gross domestic product figures for the July-through-September period, released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, came in far lower than the booming 6.7 percent growth in the previous quarter, reflecting an economy struggling anew amid the delta variant surge, which tore through unvaccinated communities in August and September and is only easing now. The third quarter was the...
__label__3 In ‘Deep Blue’ New York, Voters Reject Democrats’ Push for Election ChangesIn one of the bluest states in the nation, voters soundly rejected proposed changes to election law that congressional Democrats are trying to impose nationally.  New York state voters voted “no” on Democrat-supported amendments to the state Constitution, pitched as “voting rights” measures, that would have expanded absentee voting, allowed same-day voter registration, and changed the rules on drawing legislative districts.  Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year have passed four bills that were variations of their initial bill, HR 1, dubbed the “For the People Act.” The measures would ban...
__label__2 With racial justice in mind, US rethinks highwaysThrough the years that she has been fighting against it, Amy Stelly’s opponent has remained unmoved, looming nearby and covering her New Orleans home with filth: an elevated highway, towering above her once-thriving neighborhood. Since its construction in the 1960s, the section of Interstate 10 running above Claiborne Avenue has decimated what used to be the center of the city’s Black community, said Ms. Stelly, including businesses and greenery. Once a bustling retail corridor shaded by mature oak trees, the street satisfied all of the community’s needs, the designer and...
__label__5 Deficit shrinks in the first year of Joe Biden's presidencyANALYSISWhen it comes to the deficit, Americans have endured a remarkably consistent pattern for four decades. It starts with a Republican presidential candidate denouncing the deficit and vowing to balance the budget if elected. That Republican then takes office, abandons interest in the issue, and expresses indifference when the deficit becomes vastly larger. Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize. During the Democratic administration, the...
__label__3 Trump’s Bad NightOPINIONGlenn Youngkin did it his own way, barely mentioning the former president’s name, and still turned out MAGA voters in droves. November 2 was a boffo night for the Republican Party, and not such a great night for Donald Trump. It’s not as though the interests of the two are diametrically opposed, but they are in tension. To the extent that the GOP shows that it can thrive without former President Trump being on the ballot or even at the center of attention, it undermines the idea that he, and only...
__label__1 U.S. announces plans to ramp up offshore wind capacity in a big wayThe U.S. wants to expand its offshore wind capacity to 30 gigawatts by 2030, a move the Biden administration hopes will generate thousands of jobs and unlock billions of dollars in investment in coming years. The target, announced by the Departments of Energy, Interior and Commerce on Monday, represents a significant ramp-up of America’s fledgling offshore wind industry, which trails other parts of the world. The United States’ first offshore wind facility, the 30 megawatt Block Island Wind Farm, began commercial operations in late 2016. By contrast, the world’s first...
__label__5 Biden’s vaccine mandate has cargo giants in a pre-holiday panicA trade group for air cargo giants like UPS and FedEx is sounding the alarm over an impending Dec. 8 vaccine deadline imposed by President Joe Biden, complaining it threatens to wreak havoc at the busiest time of the year — and add yet another kink to the supply chain. “We have significant concerns with the employer mandates announced on Sept. 9, 2021, and the ability of industry members to implement the required employee vaccinations by Dec. 8, 2021,” Stephen Alterman, president of the Cargo Airline Association, wrote in a letter...

"In a cycle like this, no Democrat is safe," said NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN). Adding fuel to the fire, Tuesday's...
__label__1 If Biden picks Brainard over Powell for Fed chief, expect an immediate market impactANALYSISIf Lael Brainard is named Federal Reserve chairman, the first move by financial markets may be to price in an even more dovish central bank. That means the Fed would be expected to take longer to raise interest rates or tighten policy than under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Currently, traders are expecting the Fed to begin raising rates in the second half of next year, once it winds down its bond buying program. Until just recently, Powell was expected to be renominated to the chairmanship, but President Joe Biden has now interviewed both Powell and...

Next came the headlines, and then the reminders from social media users dishing out the same advice. Holiday shopping starts a little earlier every year, but this isn’t just the typical push. People are encouraged to order their gifts as soon as possible or risk having packages arrive late, due to rampant supply chain disruptions and mailing delays. Even books (yes, books!) aren’t safe from the impending shortages. The holiday shopping industrial...

__label__2 Ignore ‘hysterical people’ — inflation is not here to stay, economist saysA breakdown of the latest U.S. data indicates that inflation is confined to certain sectors and will not pose a threat to the recovery, according to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. U.S. CPI inflation came in at an annual 6.2% in October, its steepest climb for more than 30 years. Energy, shelter and vehicle costs led the gains, which more than wiped out the wage increases that workers received for the month. The persistent high inflation and continuation of pressures such as supply chain bottlenecks have led many...

In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin knocked off Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor, upsetting the former governor of Virginia who was an early favorite to retake the office. Youngkin’s victory was joined by Republican Winsome Sears, who defeated Democrat Hala Ayala for lieutenant governor, and Republican Jason Miyares, who upset incumbent Democrat Mark Herring for attorney general. In New Jersey, GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is running neck-and-neck with Democratic...

On Tuesday more than 100 ships were waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The backlog has seen dozens of ships idling in the waters outside the ports for weeks, and the bottleneck is expected to continue into next year. The Biden administration has pledged to expand port operations to address the mounting problems amid an overwhelming demand for imported...

'Annoying and offensive' Jones surmised that Democrats have been living in a political bubble and not paying attention to voters' real day-to-day needs — and paid for it at the ballot box. "I think that the Democrats are coming across in ways that we don't recognize that...
__label__2 Judge Tosses Out Michael Cohen’s Bid For Trump Organization To Pay His Legal BillsA state court in Manhattan will not require the Trump Organization to reimburse former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for millions of dollars in legal expenses, a judge ruled Friday, dismissing a years-old lawsuit filed by the Trump loyalist-turned-antagonist. Manhattan Judge Joel Cohen dismissed Michael Cohen’s lawsuit with prejudice Friday. Cohen sued the Trump Organization in early 2019, alleging the company had promised to pay any legal bills he incurred for a slew of federal investigations into his work, but backed out of that agreement after Cohen began cooperating with investigators. But the judge concluded many...

A choir of more than a dozen stand in front of a crowd singing a gospel song that holds a little extra weight this year. “Hold out, don’t give up. Help is on the way.” The help students want is both specific and broad. At its simplest level, they are demanding that the school fix their living...
__label__3 Youngkin Defeats McAuliffe, Wins Virginia In Decisive Referendum On The Left’s Culture WarOPINIONRepublican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday to become the next governor of Virginia. The race is widely seen as a bellwether for far-left Democrat policy priorities, specifically the party’s radical positions on education. Those include COVID school closures, critical race theory, targeting parents who speak out against school boards, and — in Virginia’s Loudoun County — covering up alleged incidents of sexual assault that cast doubt on transgender policies. Youngkin gave a victory speech to his supporters in Chantilly in the early hours of the morning, promising...
__label__1 Most Americans Are Afraid Of InflationANALYSISYou can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, not at the liquor store): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to a report released Wednesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, largely as a result of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic.  Despite a mix of coverage in the media, the prevailing...

__label__3 Seven Take-Aways From 'Blood Bath' GOP Victories Last NightANALYSISWell, it happened.  After witnessing the party get shut out of statewide races for the last dozen years, the 2021 Virginia GOP ticket swept all three major races on Tuesday, flipping a state that voted for Joe Biden by ten percentage points just one year ago.  Any way you slice it, this is an incredible feat.  In my predictions post yesterday, I offered the following analysis, which I believe has aged rather well:  This race is a home game for McAuliffe. The fundamentals of the new Virginia electorate favor him and his party. On...
__label__2 Inflation at 30-year high. Where it goes next is (partly) up to you.Many Americans have never lived through severe inflation. Here’s why the answer to today’s worrisome price spike may revolve around consumer and business mindsets, not just kinks in supply chains. Inflation hit a 30-year high last month, according to federal data released today. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics adds new fuel to growing worries that recent price increases are not a temporary bump but the beginning of high inflation that could last – possibly for years.  American households are being strained by rising prices for everything from...

Candidates, including Democrats, have stepped away from the Black Lives Matter movement’s calls to defund police departments in response to the death of George Floyd, as crime has risen in cities and the public demands for traditional policing strategies, according to the Washington Post. A Tuesday Pew Research poll revealed that 47% of Americans want to increase funding toward police departments, while 15% want to decrease funds....

In the freest nation in the world, our system of government and our very liberty depend on free and fair elections. Whether selecting a mayor or the president of the United States, every American must be able to trust the process, or the democratic system itself breaks down. When someone commits election fraud, the process is no longer fair, everyone’s vote gets diluted, and in some cases, election results are changed.

Terry McAuliffe and Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin is firmly in the national spotlight. The commonwealth, a onetime general election battleground that’s still very competitive between the two major parties, is one of only two states that hold races for governor in the year after a presidential election, guaranteeing outsized attention from coast to coast. And the state’s gubernatorial contest is seen as a key barometer ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when the Democrats will be defending their razor-thin margins in both the House of Representatives and...
__label__2 Biden gets a new opening to shape the Federal ReserveRandal Quarles, who was the Federal Reserve's vice chair for bank supervision, submitted his resignation on Monday and will step down from his post at the end of December. Why it matters: Quarles' resignation opens up a seat on the Federal Reserve Board for President Biden to fill, giving Biden an avenue with which to shape the Fed — and a choice that could offer a clue about the president's broader vision for the central bank. What he's saying: "It has been a great privilege to work with my colleagues on the Board, throughout the Federal...

In a speech promoting the plan, Biden said it represents “historic investments in our nation and in our people.” There’s truth to that claim. The bill includes $555 billion to combat climate change, which would be by far the most substantial climate investment ever made by the federal government. It would also establish a nationwide universal preschool program, provide money to help families...

But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans.

Where Did the Money Go?After the pandemic shut down schools across the country, the federal government provided about $190 billion in aid to help them reopen and respond to the effects of the pandemic. In the year and a half since millions of children were sent home, the Education Department has done only limited tracking of how the money has been spent.

There are “no immediate plans” to tap into emergency reserves or limit energy exports outside the United States, the Energy Department told CNBC. Those are two market levers the executive branch could pull. Administration officials have suggested privately that a release from the strategic petroleum reserve would have a negligible impact, and curtailing...

On his first day in office, he canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried more than 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada through the U.S. He also rejoined the Paris Agreement and has since dispatched regulatory agencies to cut off capital from the oil and gas sector. The results have been predictable: declining domestic oil production and rising gasoline prices. And now that the chickens are coming home to roost, Biden is...

__label__2 There's a Huge Problem With Senate Democrats' Proposal to Bring Down Gas PricesOPINIONA group of Senate Democrats expressed their dismay over rising gas prices in a letter to President Biden this week, urging him to “consider all tools available at your disposal to lower U.S. gasoline prices." As Spencer reported, their ideas included "a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a ban on crude oil exports." But energy experts sounded off on their proposed strategies for bringing down prices, calling them “pure folly.” "That proposal does absolutely nothing to alleviate higher prices or to make prices lower than in any sort of...
__label__4 UN Warns Of Soaring Prices In 2022 Due To Freight Rate SpikeThe United Nations warned Thursday that a surge in container freight rates could mean higher prices for consumers next year unless pandemic-fuelled problems are untangled.The UN's trade and development agency (UNCTAD) said global import price levels could increase by 11 percent and consumer price levels by 1.5 percent between now and 2023."Global consumer prices will rise significantly in the year ahead until shipping supply chain disruptions are unblocked and port constraints and terminal inefficiencies are tackled," UNCTAD said in its Review of Maritime Transport 2021 report.
__label__3 The cold truth about hot lunch: School meal programs are running out of food and workersSquare pizza and chicken tenders suddenly get swapped for meatloaf and zucchini coins. American schoolchildren and lunch ladies grimace. And now the federal government is stepping in to help. School districts in Kansas can’t get whole-wheat flour, ranch dressing or Crispitos rolled tacos right now. In Dallas, they can’t put their hands on flatware, plates and napkins. In New York, school districts are unable to find antibiotic-free chicken, condiments or carrots. With the school year in full swing, product shortfalls, delivery delays and labor shortages have pushed the nation’s public...
__label__1 What to Do about the Left’s Empty EnvironmentalismOPINIONPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and other world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Recep Erdogan are gating in Scotland for a climate summit. You know, the usual thing. Once again, we are at a “moment of truth” and taking our “last best chance” to save the blah blah blah, you’ve heard it all before. The results are surely going to be unenforceable, meaningless, or poorly understood goals. Maybe China will pretend to comply with them. Maybe it won’t bother. World leaders will be scowled at by neurodivergent children....
__label__5 Inflation in ‘process of peaking,’ but still poses threat to investor portfolios, says Wells FargoInvestors are watching closely for any signs that the surge in the cost of living during the pandemic may be starting to ebb, with Wells Fargo Investment Institute among financial firms pointing to possible relief ahead. “Inflation is in the process of peaking out,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. The recent decline in prices of raw materials for finished goods may be a sign of that, he said, as the ups and downs in costs of finished goods...
__label__3 Schools in New York City fully reopen after 18 months of pandemic restrictions.New York City’s classrooms reopened on Monday to roughly a million children, most of whom were returning for the first time since the United States’ largest school system closed in March 2020. While the city reopened schools last fall for part-time learning, the vast majority of students chose to keep learning remotely. But with no remote option now available to almost all parents, classrooms will be full for the first time in a year and a half. For months, Mayor Bill de Blasio has forecast the first day of school to be...
__label__1 Amid soaring gas prices, Democrats target oil CEOs for alleged climate liesGasoline prices at the pump are at the highest level since 2014, while the price for heating homes is projected to increase by double digits this winter. But House Democrats are focusing on what oil executives said decades ago about global warming. On Thursday, CEOs of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell will be on Capitol Hill to face a grilling about whether they deceived the public on climate perils, as the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on the Environment holds a hearing titled, "Fueling the Climate Crisis: Exposing Big Oil’s Disinformation Campaign to...
__label__4 Biden Asks FTC to Examine Oil, Gas Companies’ Role in High Gasoline PricesPresident Biden called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether oil-and-gas companies are participating in illegal conduct aimed at keeping gasoline prices high.In a Wednesday letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan, Mr. Biden alleged that there is “mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil-and-gas companies.” He said gasoline prices are rising even as the price of unfinished gasoline goes down.
__label__3 Texas Teachers Asked to Snitch on Colleagues Promoting ‘Radical Politics and Weird Theories’Some teachers at the Dallas Independent School District woke up to an email this week asking them to rat out any fellow employees for supposedly promoting so-called “critical race theory” and “predatory gender fluidity.” And they’re not happy about it. Two teachers who received the email on Wednesday shared their reactions with The Daily Beast. Both teachers requested to remain anonymous for fear of being reported on amid an increasingly tense environment for teachers. “I was incredulous that someone would take the time to write and disperse it,” one middle school...
__label__2 Biden Ditches Alaska Oil Drilling Project That Would’ve Created Thousands Of JobsThe Biden administration abandoned an oil and gas drilling project in Alaska approved by former President Donald Trump, which it had previously defended. The Department of the Interior failed to file an appeal to a federal judge’s August decision blocking the multi-billion dollar Willow Project being developed by the Texas-based oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips. Judge Sharon Gleason of the U.S. District Court of the District of Alaska ruled that the federal government hadn’t adequately reviewed the emissions profile of the project, which she said would ultimately harm the environment and wildlife. “Today’s affirmation...
__label__4 Ignore ‘hysterical people’ — inflation is not here to stay, economist saysA breakdown of the latest U.S. data indicates that inflation is confined to certain sectors and will not pose a threat to the recovery, according to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. U.S. CPI inflation came in at an annual 6.2% in October, its steepest climb for more than 30 years. Energy, shelter and vehicle costs led the gains, which more than wiped out the wage increases that workers received for the month. The persistent high inflation and continuation of pressures such as supply chain bottlenecks have led many...
__label__3 Biden Administration Promises to Help School Districts That Defy DeSantis’ Mask Mandate BanThe Biden Administration is offering a helping hand to school districts that are fed up with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ handling of COVID-19. In a Friday letter to DeSantis and Florida’s Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona offered financial assistance to schools in the state implementing their own mask mandates to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On July 30, DeSantis announced an executive order banning school districts from imposing mask mandates for students. As punishment for defiance, DeSantis said that he would strip pay for teachers and administrators in Florida...
__label__2 Climate backfire: Coal-fired power jumps as natural gas prices soarCoal-fired electricity generation climbed this year in the U.S. for the first time since the Obama administration, spurred by spiking natural gas prices, a setback for the Biden climate agenda and a sign that the president’s drilling crackdown may be backfiring. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday that electricity generated by coal-fired plants is expected to jump by 22% in 2021 over last year’s levels for the first year-over-year increase since 2014. The reason: the rising cost of natural gas, which began climbing in April and hit a 13-year...
__label__5 Warehouses are overwhelmed by America's shopping spreeDoug Kiersey has been building, buying and leasing warehouses for almost 40 years. He's never seen a time like this. "It's completely unprecedented," says Kiersey, president of Dermody Properties, which owns warehouses used by some of the country's largest retailers. "In some markets ... we're over 99% occupancy." In simplest terms, America's warehouses are running out of space. It's all claimed and bursting at the seams. How did that happen? Warehouses have become a key middle link in the country's supply chain. Couches, phones, floorboards and virtually everything else a...
__label__3 Inflation emerges as a 2022 campaign dividing lineTight congressional races across the nation are quickly turning into battlegrounds over a key economic question: whether President Joe Biden’s spending agenda is the chief culprit for inflation concerns gripping the country. Republicans are latching onto heightened anxiety tied to the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in three decades. Democrats, meanwhile, are scrambling to preempt the attacks by focusing on broader benefits of the multitrillion-dollar packages. The opposing bets on the infrastructure and social spending plans are laying the groundwork for a year of sparring tied to voters’ growing worries about...
__label__2 Keeping Warm This Winter Could Be More Costly As Inflation Heats UpRising inflation and higher demand for fuel mean most Americans will see big increases in their winter heating bills this year, the U.S. Department of Energy warns in a report released Wednesday. About half of American households rely on natural gas for heat, and they will pay about 30 percent more for heat than last year—and perhaps as much as 50 percent more if the winter is 10 percent colder than expected, the department estimates. That means the average family that relies on natural gas to stay warm this winter will shell out $746...
__label__4 U.S. Shoppers Boosted Spending Last Month, Taking on Higher PricesAmerican consumers spent more at the start of the holiday shopping season, brushing off concerns about higher prices at retailers last month. Sales at U.S. retail stores, online sellers, and restaurants rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% in October compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Consumers continued their stepped-up spending despite continued Covid-19 fears and inflation concerns. Spending rose sharply, by 4%, at online retailers, along with big gains at electronics, appliance and hardware stores. Grocery-store sales rose by 1.1% while restaurant and bar sales were flat. Other gains occurred at...

__label__2 House Republicans Probe Climate Groups’ Ties to ChinaA pair of top House Republicans demanded information from several progressive organizations on their ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, ranking member on the oversight and investigations subcommittee, wrote letters Sunday to four left-wing climate-focused groups with a series of questions. The groups—the Sunrise Movement, the Union of Concerned Scientists, MoveOn, and Earthworks—had asked the Biden administration in a July letter to “eschew the dominant antagonistic approach” toward China and work with it on combating climate change....
__label__4 Who still thinks inflation is transitory?Is inflation transitory? Executives are talking about it more than ever, but there’s little agreement on whether the spike in price increases will be sticky or fleeting. The word “transitory” has been mentioned more than 200 times in November, according to transcripts of earnings calls, conferences, and shareholder meetings compiled by Sentieo, a financial data platform. That’s already a monthly record, even though November is only half over. Discussions about price increases between executives and analysts have reached a fever pitch as US inflation rose in October at the fastest pace in 30 years.
__label__3 Beto O’Rourke to run for governor of Texas in 2022 electionBeto O’Rourke, a former congressman, Senate candidate and contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, will run for governor of Texas next year. O’Rourke is seeking to take on Greg Abbott, the Republican governor who is pursuing a third term. Abbott is seen as more vulnerable than he was previously, given demographic changes and events including the failure of much of the Texas power grid during a period of very cold weather in February of this year, which led to numerous deaths. “I’m running for governor,” O’Rourke announced on Monday. “Together, we can push past the small and divisive...
__label__1 NYC Will Invest $75 Million in Electric Vehicles and Charging InfrastructureThe New York City mayor announced on Wednesday a new $75 million investment in state electric vehicles and charging infrastructure as a part of a bigger initiative to transition the entire city fleet to electric vehicles. The plans will replace 300 gas-powered city fleet vehicles and retrofit 125 diesel-powered trucks to run on electricity, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, according to a statement. The investment also includes replacing three diesel buses and adding 78 electric ambulances, the statement said. Nearly 275 electric chargers, 20 portable chargers that can be moved around the city,...
__label__5 Most Americans Are Afraid Of InflationANALYSISYou can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, not at the liquor store): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to a report released Wednesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, largely as a result of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic.  Despite a mix of coverage in the media, the prevailing...
__label__3 Christie’s calculus: Trump is ‘in the rearview mirror’He doesn’t actually say the name Donald Trump when he lays out what’s wrong with the Republican Party. But it’s obvious who Chris Christie is talking about in recent speeches, interviews and in a new book that’s set for release next week. The former New Jersey governor has launched what amounts to a de facto exploratory bid for president, and it’s already put him on a collision course with his longtime political ally. While Christie’s criticism of the party’s focus on the 2020 election results and subtle knocks on other...
__label__2 How Manufacturers Are Modifying Processes to Conserve WaterThe appeal for green is growing: among Americans, 77 percent say they are concerned about the environmental impact of the products they buy, according to a 2021 study from GreenPrint, an environmental technology company. In addition, nearly eight in ten consumers indicate sustainability is important for them, and more than 70 percent would pay an average of 35 percent more for brands that demonstrate environmental responsibility, per an IBM survey released in 2020 (pdf). These preferences note a change from several years ago, when a study by Euromonitor International found consumers to...
__label__4 Why are oil prices so high? And what can be done about it?ANALYSISPresident Joe Biden faced an awkward moment during the international climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, when he was asked at a press conference about inflation back home, including gasoline prices. “If you take a look at gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil,” Biden said Nov. 2 at the United Nations’ COP26 summit. “And we’ll see what happens on that score sooner than later.” OPEC is the group of 13...

Analilia Mejia, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ former national political director, and DaMareo Cooper, BlackPAC’s previous national organizing director, will be co-executive directors of the organization. Mejia and Cooper said their strategy to win Senate and gubernatorial races next year, which are expected to be an uphill climb for the Democratic Party, is to prioritize the progressive...
__label__2 Biden Administration Releases Plan to Shift Half of U.S. Energy to Solar by 2050The Biden administration on Wednesday released an outline mapping out how the U.S. could produce half of its electricity using solar power by 2050 — a sizeable undertaking given that it accounted for just 4 percent of the country’s electricity last year. The blueprint showed the U.S. would have to double the amount of solar energy installed each year over the next four years and then double it again by 2030. While the report says the increase is in line with what has been recommended by climate scientists to prevent the worst effects of...
__label__5 A surge in the US affordable housing supply is coming from people who can’t afford their homesANALYSISMore affordable housing is finally coming back onto the market. The pandemic-triggered housing boom in the US, which saw average prices rise 13.2% over the last year, is finally slowing down. More low-priced homes were put up for sale in the third quarter of 2021 than any other segment, according to the latest housing report from real estate brokerage Redfin. Homes in the “most affordable” tier, which represents homes priced below 95% of others on the market, rose by 13% compared to a year prior. The affordable listings were up across the US, but the highest...
__label__3 Two recounts appear likely in tight Virginia House racesDays after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts show Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by The Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are under 0.5%, which...
__label__2 Environmentalists irked after Interior resumes oil-and-gas leasing under court orderThe Interior Department announced Monday that it would resume new oil-and-gas leasing on public lands to comply with a federal court order, but environmentalists weren’t happy about it.   Climate groups urged President Biden to stick to his promise to ban drilling on federal lands and waters after the department said it would adhere to the June 15 preliminary injunction ending the pause on leasing sales while the Justice Department appeals the ruling.   “DOJ is appealing that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,” said the...
__label__5 Investors are piling into infrastructure stocks after House passes Biden planStocks tied to infrastructure moved higher on Monday morning after the House of Representatives passed a $1 trillion bill over the weekend, giving President Joe Biden one of his signature achievements and rewarding investors who bet on his plan. The strength for those infrastructure stocks showed up in the Global X US Infrastructure Investment ETF, which trades under ticker PAVE, as it gained 1.5% and hit an all-time high in the opening minutes of the session. The fund’s top holdings include stocks like Nucor and Vulcan Materials, which moved solidly higher on Monday morning....
__label__3 Republican wave builds to take back the HouseRepublicans could hardly be better poised to recapture the House majority. Increasingly aggressive redistricting, a diverse slate of candidates raking in record-breaking amounts of cash and a political atmosphere that just keeps getting more favorable has Democrats watching with a growing sense of dread. Last week alone, the GOP saw the stirrings of a full-fledged suburban revival from Virginia to New Jersey to New York — and also possibly ended the careers of as many five Democratic incumbents with punishing new congressional maps in three other states. Republicans were plotting to cement...
__label__2 Biden’s energy idiocy: Kneecap US oil but beg OPEC to pump moreOPINIONPresident Joe Biden’s latest policy push has us doing not just a double take but a triple take: The man who’s put roadblock after roadblock in the way of North American energy companies in pursuit of his vow to decarbonize the US economy is . . . begging OPEC to boost fossil-fuel production. Why? The prez complains the high price of gas is hurting the post-pandemic economic recovery. Seriously. “OPEC+ must do more to support the recovery,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared Wednesday, and his boss backed him up. The...

From impacting their ability to get ahead in the country to shaping their daily life experiences to dealing with discrimination, skin color is seen by Latinos as an important factor affecting their lives and life chances. A majority (62%) of Hispanic adults say having a darker skin color hurts Hispanics’ ability to get ahead in the United States today at least a little. A similar share (59%) say having a lighter skin color helps Hispanics get...
__label__3 Column: Biden’s in deep trouble. He can still bounce backOPINIONWhen Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he had all the advantages of a nonincumbent in a year when everything had gone wrong. Biden waged a careful, disciplined campaign, built around a simple message: He would end the pandemic, rebuild the economy and restore normalcy. After the chaos of the Trump years, that was enough. Governing has been more difficult. The pandemic, fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, didn’t end. The economy’s recovery has come with worrisome inflation, shortages and supply chain problems. In public opinion polls,...

The field, known as Savage's Station, owes its name to the...
__label__4 Moderna Crash Wipes Out Another $24 Billion After Supply-Chain Issues Dent Covid Vaccine SalesModerna shares plummeted Thursday morning after the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech firm posted worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and warned sales of its Covid-19 vaccines would fail to meet previous projections, fueling pessimism among analysts that warning the stock’s meteoric gains would fail to hold up amid supply-chain constraints as the pandemic wanes. Shares of Moderna plunged 17% shortly after the market opened Thursday, wiping out more than $24 billion in market value and pushing prices to a three-month low of $287. Triggering the morning crash, Moderna on Thursday reported third-quarter sales and earnings that...
__label__3 Murphy Narrowly Wins Re-election as New Jersey GovernorPhilip D. Murphy, a New Jersey Democrat whose aggressive approach to controlling the pandemic became a focal point of the bid to unseat him, narrowly held onto the governor’s office in an unexpectedly close election that highlighted stark divisions over mask and vaccine mandates, even in a liberal-leaning state. With roughly 90 percent of the vote tallied, Mr. Murphy was ahead of his Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, by less than 1 percentage point when The Associated Press called the race just before 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday after a protracted count....

Biden’s executive order will also set a new schedule for the development of new long-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards to tackle pollution and other objectives, the White House said in a release. There is also action on near-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway...

__label__3 Progressives bare teeth after election debacleProgressives are over it. Minutes after networks declared Republican Glenn Youngkin the winner of Virginia’s gubernatorial race, strategists, activists and outside groups in the Democratic Party’s left wing began firing the first shots in the intraparty war over who is at fault for Tuesday’s shellacking. Their message: Blame the moderates in charge, not us. Their emboldened stance in the wake of the devastating loss for Democrats in Virginia, as well as setbacks in New Jersey, Minneapolis and Buffalo, N.Y., suggests that progressives will not change course ahead of the 2022 midterms...
__label__1 Top Republican says Biden oil and gas leasing pause has already stopped investmentWESTERMAN ON LEASING PAUSE: Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, argues the Biden administration’s pause on oil and gas lease sales, now in its sixth month, has already had its intended effect, even if leasing resumes soon. “Their objective is to create uncertainty, which is just as good as saying we aren't leasing anymore,” Westerman told me in an interview. “If they stop capital investment in these projects, they are accomplishing the same thing to say no more leases.” Westerman’s argument comes as the Interior...
__label__4 Weekly jobless claims better than expected in another sign of healing for employmentThe U.S. unemployment picture improved again last week, with initial filings for unemployment insurance falling to another pandemic-era low. First-time claims dropped to 269,000 for the week ended Oct. 30, down 14,000 from the previous period and better than the Dow Jones estimate for 275,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The decline in filings comes amid a rollback in special programs initiated during the crisis, with the total of those receiving benefits under all programs dropping another 157,731 to 2.67 million. As the jobs picture clears up, the four-week moving...
__label__3 Democrats Face Economic Gut-Check After GOP Taps Voters’ AngstANALYSISDemocrats will argue for months about what led to their defeat at the ballot box on Tuesday -- whether it was their messaging, their candidates or their president. But there was consensus that the first step is to get something done on economic issues. One day after an embarrassing loss in the Virginia gubernatorial election and a dispiritingly tight race in New Jersey, Democrats from President Joe Biden to moderate and progressive members of Congress cast passage of his infrastructure and $1.75 trillion social spending package as a panacea for...
__label__2 Biden's environmentalism is pummeling the nationOPINIONPresident Joe Biden inherited a great gift from the Trump administration: energy independence. The benefits cannot be overstated: Cheap, reliable energy is key to economic growth and broad-based prosperity. Yet Biden has squandered this advantage. Retail gas prices are up 55.95% from last year, with California gas prices hitting nearly $8 a gallon . This has hit pocketbooks directly through costs to keep the lights and heat on in homes, and indirectly through rising prices for all sorts of goods, the production and transportation of which require the use of more expensive...

They work for profit or fees in their own enterprises and are a representation of America’s small business owners. Many also create jobs for other workers, on the order of about 30 million in recent years. A new Pew Research Center analysis of government data finds that the COVID-19 recession, which curtailed business operations for public health reasons, had a similar impact on employment levels among both those who are and are not self-employed....
__label__3 Republicans Once Supported the Voting Rights Act. Today, They Voted Against its Restoration.ANALYSISOn Wednesday afternoon, GOP senators blocked Democrats from advancing a key voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, marking the second time in two weeks and the fourth time this year that Republicans have filibustered voting rights legislation that would combat GOP voter suppression efforts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it a “low, low point in the history of this body.” Republicans have now prevented three different voting rights bills introduced by Democrats from reaching the Senate floor.

__label__2 Biden Moves to Wreck U.S. Oil IndustryOPINIONthe Biden administration is escalating its war against the American oil industry. According to an article in the November 2, 2021, Wall Street Journal, Biden’s EPA will soon issue regulations requiring that all associated natural gas released in conjunction with oil production be put in pipelines for delivery to market. The destructive impact of the proposed new regulations cannot be overstated. Oil producers already put associated natural gas in pipelines wherever they are available. The problem is that they are not always available. For example, they are never available offshore or in regions that are new...
__label__4 Wanted, due to supply chain shortages: used crutches, walkers and canesFrom Utah to South Carolina and Kentucky, hospitals and charities are asking for gently used crutches, canes and walkers.

Terry McAuliffe and delivering the state back into the GOP’s hands. Media outlets called the race for Youngkin early Wednesday morning. The final margin isn’t yet clear, but no matter what, it represents a major swing of Virginia voters toward Republicans that will strike fear into Democrats’ hearts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. In 2017, Democrats won the governor’s race by 9...
__label__2 Elite Hypocrisy on Display at Glasgow Climate SummitOPINIONPresident Biden and other world leaders are gathered in Glasgow, Scotland this week for a United Nations summit on climate change. It's basically a self-flagellation ceremony for the leaders of the world to traverse from their respective countries around the globe in order to talk about how evil carbon emissions are and what they're going to do to supposedly save the world.  From what can be seen at the climate change confab, though, these world leaders shouldn't be lecturing citizens of the world about how they can adjust their habits...
__label__4 Your public school kid's lunch might be served on a pizza slice box. Here's whyAmerican public school students are likely eating a lot more meals at school this year. School food has been free for lower-income kids and some entire districts in the past, and it has been available for purchase to other kids, sometimes at a reduced cost. School districts are responsible for their own programs and are then reimbursed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), primarily for the subsidized meals.

But even as Democrats were processing a battering in the Virginia governor’s race and the uncomfortably close gubernatorial election in New Jersey, the White House and officials across the party pledged to forge ahead with the twin pillars of the president’s domestic agenda. Several made the case that Tuesday’s results only added to the pressure for them to do so. “We have to show we can govern,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), citing a recent breakthrough in talks to...
__label__2 What to Do about the Left’s Empty EnvironmentalismOPINIONPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and other world leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Recep Erdogan are gating in Scotland for a climate summit. You know, the usual thing. Once again, we are at a “moment of truth” and taking our “last best chance” to save the blah blah blah, you’ve heard it all before. The results are surely going to be unenforceable, meaningless, or poorly understood goals. Maybe China will pretend to comply with them. Maybe it won’t bother. World leaders will be scowled at by neurodivergent children....
__label__4 Covid-19 Pushed Many Americans to Retire. The Economy Needs Them Back.ANALYSISThe Covid-19 pandemic has boosted retirements among baby boomers, further straining the tight labor supply and leaving a hole for employers to fill. Older workers who could least afford to retire early—those with lower incomes and less education—have been more likely to leave the workforce during the pandemic, researchers have found. The question is whether their retreat is temporary or permanent. Some retired because of Covid-19 fears, and others after failing to find suitable work. The rising value of stocks, homes and other assets also has prompted a group of more affluent boomers to...
__label__3 Maricopa County Audit Did Not Find 712,152 New Trump VotesFACT CHECKSince June 23, 2021, a political Facebook post has been shared at least tens of thousands of times. The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona. It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden’s Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes. In November 2021, the same misleading Maricopa County audit post was shared again, thrusting it back into the spotlight. For example, it was shared by...
__label__2 Amid soaring gas prices, Democrats target oil CEOs for alleged climate liesGasoline prices at the pump are at the highest level since 2014, while the price for heating homes is projected to increase by double digits this winter. But House Democrats are focusing on what oil executives said decades ago about global warming. On Thursday, CEOs of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell will be on Capitol Hill to face a grilling about whether they deceived the public on climate perils, as the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on the Environment holds a hearing titled, "Fueling the Climate Crisis: Exposing Big Oil’s Disinformation Campaign to...
__label__4 Want to solve America's labor shortage? Hire immigrants and foreignersOPINIONThe U.S. war on immigrants is worsening the labor shortage. But some Americans would rather destroy the supply chain and shutter industries than admit it – and do something about it. Evidence of scarce workers is everywhere. Shipping containers remained unopened from Los Angeles to Georgia. Restaurants, hotels, trucking and other industries are begging for workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that “employers are struggling to fill more than 10 million job openings and meet soaring consumer demand.” Industries hardest hit by a record number of workers quitting include manufacturing, retail, trade, transportation and utilities. And those workers...
__label__3 In the city where George Floyd was killed, the mayor fights to keep his job in a tough reelection raceMayor Jacob Frey (D) had barely begun his event on public safety when a woman confronted him about the violence that has erupted across the city in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. The day before, a boy had been grazed by a stray bullet that pierced his bedroom wall while he was sleeping — one of more than 575 people injured by gunfire across Minneapolis this year. Why wasn’t Frey talking about the wounding of another child, demanded Angela Williams, a Black anti-violence activist who clutched a...
__label__1 New Zealand Becomes First Country in the World to Pass Climate Change Disclosure LawNew Zealand has become the first country in the world to pass a law ensuring financial organizations disclose and act on climate-related risks and opportunities, the government announced on Thursday. The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Bill passed its third reading with the goal of driving New Zealand’s push toward carbon neutrality by 2050. In a statement, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister David Clark and Climate Change Minister James Shaw said the bill was one of several actions New Zealand’s government is taking to meet its international obligations in achieving the carbon...
__label__5 The creative force of a worker exodusAmericans are quitting their workplaces at a record pace – 4.3 million in August – which may be one of the most unexpected shifts as the pandemic eases. Yet it may also be one of the most promising for the U.S. economy. Many of these “quits” are people who simply seek more pay or less stress. Yet others want to use and grow their skills with employers who – again, because of the pandemic – need the intangible capital of worker creativity to be resilient in a disrupted economy. The...
__label__3 Virginia voters head to the polls in governor's race seen as referendum on Biden and TrumpFormer Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin are locked in a tight race for Virginia governor, and the end result may provide signs for both parties on what it takes to win in the post-Trump era, as well as during Mr. Biden's first year in office.  A Republican hasn't won statewide in Virginia since 2009, one year into former President Obama's first term, when Republican Robert McDonnell won the governor's race by 17 points. For over 40 years, the party in control of the White House lost...
__label__2 Climate backfire: Coal-fired power jumps as natural gas prices soarCoal-fired electricity generation climbed this year in the U.S. for the first time since the Obama administration, spurred by spiking natural gas prices, a setback for the Biden climate agenda and a sign that the president’s drilling crackdown may be backfiring. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday that electricity generated by coal-fired plants is expected to jump by 22% in 2021 over last year’s levels for the first year-over-year increase since 2014. The reason: the rising cost of natural gas, which began climbing in April and hit a 13-year...
__label__5 A COVID strategy backfires at schoolsHundreds of school districts and universities around the country rushed to invest in new electronic air cleaning systems in the last two years to help alleviate COVID concerns. But in many cases, those investments turned out to be doing more harm than good.Why it matters: In some cases, the efforts to keep kids and teachers safe in schools may not be as effective as claimed. In other cases, the air cleaning systems could be exposing them to the harmful toxins ozone and formaldehyde, experts warn.
__label__3 The Virginia Governor's Race Will Be The Latest Verdict In The Culture WarsOPINIONEver since the Unite the Right rally, in 2017, Virginia’s politics have been in flux. Is the state, like Charlottesville, a place under threat from reactionaries, or is it, also like Charlottesville, a place that has fought them back? This past week, two developments have pointed toward some resolution: a civil trial against the rally’s organizers began, and the city of Charlottesville released six proposals to take ownership of the Confederate monuments that drew the extremists in the first place. The Statuary Park at Gettysburg proposed displaying the monuments alongside...
__label__1 Cargo ship near California pipeline made strange movements: reportA massive cargo ship made a series of unusual movements while anchored in the closest spot to a Southern California oil pipeline that ruptured and sent crude washing up on beaches, according to data collected by a marine navigation service.The Coast Guard is investigating whether a ship anchor might have snagged and bent the pipeline owned by Amplify Energy, a Houston-based company that operates three offshore oil platforms south of Los Angeles.
__label__4 Is civics education a ‘right’? Rhode Island case tests theory.An educated society is vital to democracy, but are schools obligated to teach students how government works? And who should decide that, the states or the courts? Both questions are at the heart of an appeals case in Boston. Growing up in Providence, Rhode Island, Ahmed Sesay never had a class in civics. When he graduated from high school in 2019, he had to teach himself how to vote and pay his taxes. Now 20 years old, Mr. Sesay is part of a lawsuit being decided by a Boston-based court...
__label__3 Letitia James Declares Her Candidacy for N.Y. GovernorLetitia James, the New York attorney general who oversaw the inquiry into sexual harassment claims against former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that ultimately led to his resignation, declared her candidacy for governor on Friday, setting up a history-making, high-profile matchup in the Democratic primary. She begins the campaign as Gov. Kathy Hochul’s most formidable challenger, and her announcement triggers a start to what may be an extraordinarily competitive primary — a contest set to be shaped by issues of ideology, race and region in a state still battling its way out of the...
__label__1 Biden Moves to Wreck U.S. Oil IndustryOPINIONthe Biden administration is escalating its war against the American oil industry. According to an article in the November 2, 2021, Wall Street Journal, Biden’s EPA will soon issue regulations requiring that all associated natural gas released in conjunction with oil production be put in pipelines for delivery to market. The destructive impact of the proposed new regulations cannot be overstated. Oil producers already put associated natural gas in pipelines wherever they are available. The problem is that they are not always available. For example, they are never available offshore or in regions that are new...
__label__4 Economics 101: More college classes bring moral debates to the surfaceProfessors have often presented economics as the realm of rational people making efficient choices. Now many are highlighting the ethical questions behind the theories. For the past five years, economists Wendy Carlin and Sam Bowles got professors from around the world to ask thousands of first-year economics students one basic question on their first day of class. What is the most pressing problem economists should be addressing? Among responses such as globalization, digitalization, and unemployment, two concerns dwarf the rest in the most recent data: inequality and climate change.  But...

The countries which have signed up are responsible for around 40 percent of methane emissions around the planet, whose molecules have a more powerful warming effect than carbon...
__label__1 EPA issues emergency OK for first long-lasting disinfectant against COVID-19The Environmental Protection Agency granted emergency approval Monday for the first long-lasting disinfectant against COVID-19 — which could kill the virus on surfaces for days after cleanings. The product, SurfaceWise 2 from the Texas-based company Allied BioScience, has the technology to deactivate the virus on surfaces for up to a week, ABC News reported. “This initial EPA approval clears the way to effectively protect people against COVID-19 as a residual solution proven to provide long-term, non-toxic surface protection from viruses, including coronaviruses,” Allied BioScience CEO Michael Ruley said in a...
__label__5 What’s behind the growing gap between men and women in college completion?DATAThe growing gender gap in higher education – both in enrollment and graduation rates – has been a topic of conversation and debate in recent months. Young women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, and among those ages 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have a four-year college degree. The gap in college completion is even wider among younger adults ages 25 to 34. Women’s educational gains have occurred alongside their growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy. The implications...
__label__3 Money For Green Energy Creates More Jobs Than Fossil Fuel Investment, New Study FindsAs Congress debates whether to pare down the Biden administration’s signature climate proposals or allow the fossil fuel industry to benefit more from new government programs, new research suggests doing so would create far fewer jobs. For every million dollars the United States government invests, solar produces over 2.7 times more jobs than fossil fuels, according to an analysis from two environmental think tanks and a labor union. Wind energy spurs over 2.8 times more jobs than investments in oil, gas and coal. And retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient creates demand for...

The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing $300 million to fund the architectural, engineering, planning, design, and construction of wastewater facilities in the Tijuana River Valley, which stretches several miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, an EPA spokeswoman wrote in an email Thursday. The money is part of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act,...
__label__5 COMIC: If history is a guide, schools will start requiring COVID vaccinesANALYSISThe first time kids had to get a vaccine to go to school was more than 200 years ago. The disease? Smallpox. For the past four decades, all 50 U.S. states have required that parents, if they want to enroll their children in any school, public or private, must vaccinate them against contagious diseases like polio and measles. The reason is simple: High rates of vaccination dramatically cut deaths and have all but eliminated some diseases. But as long as there have been vaccines, there have been people who oppose them, formerly known as...
__label__3 From Soda to Blackouts, A Global Gas Crisis Is Causing HavocChina is experiencing rolling blackouts and factory shutdowns. U.K. soda shelves may soon be empty. Fertilizer plants are shutting down and slaughterhouses are growing wary of how long they can withstand periods without a crucial ingredient they need to keep up meat production.  The common denominator between all of these strained industries is a crucial, yet perhaps unexpected commodity: natural gas.  A confluence of factors, and political entities (governments of China, Russia, the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U., to name a few) have coalesced and caused global natural gas prices to surge to record highs. This is...

__label__5 Why education was a top voter priority this electionIt touches most every household in the United States, whether as taxpayers or as parents, but come Election Day, education rarely makes it to the top of voter priorities. That wasn't the case this week. Republican Glenn Youngkin made schools, and particularly parental control, his closing issue in his upset win over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. Between September and October polls, education rose 9 points to be the top issue for voters going into the race, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Parents who wanted more voice...
__label__2 ‘Eco’ wood stoves emit 750 times more pollution than an HGV, study showsNew wood burning stoves billed as more environmentally friendly still emit 750 times more tiny particle pollution than a modern HGV truck, a report has shown. Only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold from the start of 2022 in the UK and EU, but experts said the regulation was shockingly weak. The report used data on the emissions produced by stoves in perfect laboratory conditions and the pollution could be even higher in everyday use, the researchers said, with older stoves being much worse. Tiny particle...

Youngkin made the pledge during a rally in Henrico on Saturday. His comments came during a section of his speech that focused on improvements to education he would implement if he were elected. "We all know education starts with curriculum," Youngkin told supporters at the rally. "So let me be clear: we will teach accelerated math, we will award advanced diplomas and we will teach all...
__label__3 Google wants to show flyers their carbon emissions with flight options in sustainable travel pushThis Wednesday, Google launched a new feature that displays a carbon emissions estimate for nearly every flight in its search results next to the price and duration of the flight. It'll allow eco-conscious travelers to factor carbon emissions into their choice when deciding which flight to book. These emissions estimates are flight-specific as well as seat-specific. For instance, newer aircraft generally pollute less than older aircraft, and emissions increase for premium economy and first-class seats because they take up more space and account for a larger share of total emissions, according to Richard Holden, Google's vice president of...
__label__2 Asian Americans Disprove CRTOPINIONAccording to the illiberal race-hustlers among us, America is a thoroughly racist nation where you only succeed if (and because) you are white. Therefore, we need government to coercively redistribute wealth and allocate important positions by racial quotas. Only through such measures can we attain “equity.” That theory collapses when examined with any care. A person’s race or ancestry has nothing to do with his success or failure in life. In today’s Martin Center article, Kenny Xu demolishes critical race theory by pointing out that Asian Americans have enjoyed great success...
__label__4 Should there be special programs for gifted students?New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday announced a plan to gradually eliminate his city’s program for gifted and talented students in K-12 schools. Starting next fall, the nation’s largest school district will no longer admit incoming kindergartners into special gifted classes or schools. Instead, accelerated learning will be made accessible to all students in their own schools. The impending change comes after years of criticism of the racial makeup of students in the city’s gifted and talented program. About 75 percent of the 16,000 students in New York’s gifted...
__label__3 Why nuclear plants are shutting downANALYSISThe infamous Indian Point nuclear plant, located roughly 30 miles north of Manhattan, shut down earlier this year. To many, the shutdown was a victory following decades of protests about safety and environmental concerns. Here’s the problem: When operating, Indian Point provided more electricity than is produced annually by all solar and wind in New York state.Indian Point is not the only nuclear plant shutting down. Since 1990, the number of operating nuclear units in the United States has been declining.

The Equality Act would nullify the right of Christian and other religious groups and schools to hire people according to their moral and religious beliefs, and force acceptance of lifestyles contrary to their deeply held values.

__label__4 Student Loan Forgiveness Won’t Be Available To These BorrowersStudent loan forgiveness won’t be available to these student loan borrowers. Here’s what you need to know. If there is more student loan forgiveness, it’s clear who it will help. Democrats in Congress and President Joe Biden agree that there should be wide-scale student loan forgiveness. However, they disagree on at least two points on student loan cancellation. First, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) want up to $50,000 of student loans cancelled, Biden wants up to $10,000 of student loans forgiven. Second, Warren...

"I'm sure this comes from a place that is well-intended,...
__label__5 Biden plan seeks to expand education, from pre-K to collegeAs Democrats push ahead with President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion rebuilding plan, they’re promising historic investments across the arc of an education — from early childhood to college and beyond — in what advocates describe as the most comprehensive package of its kind in decades. The education provisions in Biden’s “Build Back Better” proposal would serve as a bedrock for schooling opportunities for countless Americans and test the nation’s willingness to expand federal programs in far-reaching ways. Equity is a focus, as it seeks to remove barriers to education that for decades have...
__label__3 New Orleans Needs Its Own Power SupplyOPINIONIn a city gone dark, the St. Peter Apartments were a bright spot. After most of New Orleans’ power went out over the weekend, the 50-unit affordable housing complex in Mid-City had eight hours of electricity a day. That’s a luxury right this moment; nearly a million people in Louisiana have been without service since Hurricane Ida made landfall. Residents at St. Peter Apartments can charge their phones and run appliances thanks to a 178-kilowatt solar array on the roof and a battery downstairs. “We were able to give folks...
__label__2 Black History Month: 4 Inspirational African-American InventorsAs the nation continues to deal with racial injustice, February provides us with the opportunity to celebrate the many Black Americans who have shaped our history. When Carter G. Woodrow proposed Black History Month in 1926 (initially Negro History Week), it was his intent to address the lack of African-American history acknowledged in the school systems. Woodrow, known as the Father of Black History, said, "Those who have no record of what their forebears have accomplished lose the inspiration which comes from the teaching of biography and history." Many of...
__label__5 Can there be a winner in the school culture wars?ANALYSISIn a typical back-to-school season, markers and poster board might be on a classroom supply list. This year, they’re also hot items for protesters attending their local school board meetings.  Mask mandates, critical race theory, “you name the issue and people want to speak out,” says Heath Miller, a high school band director in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who considers this the most stressful period of his 20 years teaching. In recent weeks, individuals in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, lit masks on fire outside a school board meeting. Pro-mask protesters in Fort Worth, Texas, staged a mock...

But it was recently the backdrop, in the search for greener flying, to a strange and remarkable scene. “Anyone passing would have wondered why these people were staring at a pipe and whooping and laughing,” says Bobby Sethi, associate professor of gas turbine combustion at Cranfield University. “But we were almost certainly the only people in the world right then burning anything without producing CO2.” In...
__label__1 Asian-American Activists Blast Biden’s ‘Pandering’ Anti-Racism OrderActivists said that President Joe Biden ignored the actual concerns of Asian Americans when he signed a "pandering" executive order against anti-Asian coronavirus rhetoric that failed to mention affirmative action policies that discriminate against Asians. Biden signed an order to combat "racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders" on Tuesday. The order—which requires federal agencies to fight anti-Asian racism and promote "sensitivity" toward the Asian community in their pandemic response—was met with skepticism by some activists. Kenny Xu, an activist and author of an upcoming book, An...

__label__3 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...

Local news isn’t really helping.Parents around the country are freaking out and holding their collective breath as a new school year begins. My kid has been back at in-person school for about a month, and we’ve been averaging about two robocalls a week about new cases of Covid at school. What’s worse, the school district’s Covid plans, 20 months into the pandemic, seem to be another fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants affair. Our school didn’t post its Covid protocols on its website until three weeks after classes started. Quarantine criteria are opaque, and what you do catch in tidbits from...
__label__3 How you could see cleaner air and water with Biden’s new infrastructure lawANALYSISPresident Joe Biden signed into law on Monday a bipartisan infrastructure bill that includes $350 billion to address long-ignored environmental threats. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the largest sum in recent memory directed at cleaning up pollution, from replacing lead pipes to capping methane-spewing oil wells. The funding could make a serious dent in air and water pollution for certain communities by preventing runoff from abandoned mines and cleaning up old, toxic manufacturing sites. People who live near busy roadways, airports, and ports may benefit from the boost to electric vehicle charging stations,...
__label__1 The Confederacy Is DeadOPINIONIt has become fashionable in some circles to liken the Republican Party to the Southern Confederacy—the same Confederacy created out of the throes of sectionalism and secession to preserve racial slavery, and the same Confederacy that in 1861 inaugurated violent civil war against the lawful government of the United States. Recent essays in Rolling Stone and the New York Review of Books have given the clearest expression to this comparison. But the analogy is false, and it demands a corrective. It is self-evidently false because no American today sanctions the...

More fundamentally, as our disagreements over the rights of the unborn occur in the context of increasingly irreconcilable philosophical divisions, the new documentary is also a window into the story of our looming national crack-up. Abortion, says one of the film’s interviewees, “is our new civil war. . . in many ways, it’s a great...
__label__4 House Democrats have a new strategy to engage voters of color in the midterm electionsThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a new, multimillion-dollar effort to engage and mobilize voters of color ahead of the midterm elections, including investments in local organizing and a seven-figure research and polling effort. The plan, the details of which were shared first with NPR, includes an initial $30 million investment to hire local community organizers, launch targeted advertising campaigns aimed at nonwhite communities, as well as building voter protection and education programs. The committee is also working to combat disinformation efforts that are specifically focused on voters of...
__label__2 Countries’ climate pledges built on flawed data, Post investigation findsMalaysia’s latest catalogue of its greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations reads like a report from a parallel universe. The 285-page document suggests that Malaysia’s trees are absorbing carbon four times faster than similar forests in neighboring Indonesia. The surprising claim has allowed the country to subtract over 243 million tons of carbon dioxide from its 2016 inventory — slashing 73 percent of emissions from its bottom line. Across the world, many countries underreport their greenhouse gas emissions in their reports to the United Nations, a Washington Post investigation has found. An examination of...
__label__2 Not All Identities Are Created EqualOPINIONIn 2020, much of the public discussion of social issues revolves around notions of identity. Ideas about race, reformulations of gender, and considerations of class or religious confession. But it is not often stated that these identity categories are qualitatively different, and these differences have different implications for the real world. Some reflection on the real-world consequences of identity ought to make this apparent. Why is a party based on working-class solidarity far less sinister than a party based on a racial or ethnic group? Perhaps because being working-class is...
__label__5 Fact Checking McAuliffe’s Claim That Youngkin Wants to Ban Books by Black AuthorsFACT CHECKThe Democratic nominee in the Virginia gubernatorial race Terry McAuliffe has accused his Republican opponent Glenn Youngkin of “want[ing] to ban books by prominent Black authors from Virginia schools.” McAuliffe has made similar comments in the past few days, claiming that Youngkin is “closing his campaign on banning books … he wants to ban Toni Morrison’s book Beloved” in an interview with Meet the Press on Sunday. The basis for this claim is Youngkin’s criticism of McAuliffe’s veto of two bills that would have allowed parents to opt their children out of reading texts that contain sexual material. Neither bill...
__label__3 Fossil Fuel Lobbyists Have Larger Presence at COP26 Than Any Single Country: ReportA coalition of watchdog groups estimated Monday that fossil fuel industry representatives have a larger presence at COP26 than officials from any single country, a finding that further intensified environmentalists' concerns about the legitimacy of the high-stakes climate summit. After pouring over a 1,600-page United Nations list of approved COP26 attendees, the coalition led by Global Witness published an analysis showing that at least 503 fossil fuel lobbyists have been admitted to the summit in Glasgow, Scotland. That means the oil and gas industry—the principal driver of the crisis that COP26 was ostensibly convened to tackle—unofficially has...
__label__1 The Reawakening of the Black Gun-Rights MovementWhen Second Amendment activist Brent Holmes started showing up at police brutality protests in Richmond, Virginia, over the summer while carrying an assault rifle across his chest, passersby would cheer him on.  "'Yes, yes, he gets it,'" Holmes says. "He knows that he has those rights, too.'" Holmes, who also wears a red baseball cap with the words "I CAN'T BREATHE" embroidered across the front, is part of a community of black gun-rights activists who have been showing up armed to protests in several American cities. "You have this...
__label__5 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...
__label__3 Why some experts say corporate 'net-zero' emissions pledges could have net-zero impact on climate crisisDubbed a "code red for humanity" by the head of the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its most-recent report that the impacts of human-induced climate change are already being seen in "every region across the globe" and urgent action must be taken immediately, not decades into the future, to mitigate the devastation. As scientists sound the alarms, it has become near-impossible for business leaders to ignore the research -- or the global, youth-led protests spurred by activists like Greta Thunberg, who view climate change as an intergenerational justice issue -- as...
__label__2 China Bringing Xinjiang-Style Forced Labor Camps to Tibet, Report SaysIn what appears to replicate what’s happening in China’s Xinjiang region to Uighur Muslims, a new report from the Jamestown Foundation, corroborated by Reuters, details evidence of a vast program in a remote region of Tibet aimed at promoting Chinese national unity and patriotism, instilling “work discipline,” and eradicating what the Chinese Communist Party refers to as “backward thinking” by the Tibetan people.  According to evidence uncovered by researcher Adrian Zenz of the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank, China relocated more than 500,000 “rural surplus workers” in Tibet...
__label__5 Joe Biden's Approval Rating Remains Dismal, Kamala Harris' Is Even WorsePresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are continuing to suffer heavily in the polls following a week in which their party was rocked by a number of elections. According to a USA Today-Suffolk University poll, Biden's approval rating is currently at 38 percent, lower than another Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll taken since he took office and only just hovering above the president's all-time lows of 37 percent which were recorded by two other surveys in mid-October. Biden's approval rating is even suffering with those who voted for him in 2020. According to the results, 46...
__label__3 Biden to Unleash 'Irrevocable Climate Chaos' if US Fracked Gas Export Projects Proceed: Groups"Would climate leaders build 399 new coal plants in the U.S.?" So asks an advertisement placed in Scotland's largest daily newspaper this week by U.S. environmental and climate justice groups during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, part of an effort to persuade the Biden administration to reject all new gas exports and fossil fuel infrastructure. "The answer is no," the ad says. "Yet right now, 23 liquefied natural gas export terminals and pipelines are sitting on your desks. These projects will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to doubling all existing...
__label__1 ‘Not Refugees’: Polish Government Fact-Checks CNN on Belarus-Engineered Migrant CrisisANALYSISPoland’s national-conservative government has fact-checked CNN on the migrant crisis engineered on the European Union’s eastern border by Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman for the Minister-Coordinator of Special Services at National Security Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, admonished CNN after it published an article on the ongoing border crisis, which has seen mostly Middle Eastern and South Asian migrants clashing with Polish border guards, police officers, and soldiers manning the frontier. The American news outlet, Żaryn alleged, had “missed the point” by characterising the situation as one in which...
__label__5 Biden meets with Fed leaders Powell and Brainard as nomination decision nearsPresident Joe Biden met with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday as the administration decides whom to nominate to lead the central bank for the next four years, according to a person familiar with the matter. Powell and Brainard are seen as the two most likely candidates to lead the globe’s most powerful central bank, which sets interest rates, works to control inflation and oversees the country’s largest banks. The person told CNBC that the president has not made a final decision on who will lead the Fed. Washington and Wall...
__label__3 Scotland's 'Sphinx' snow patch melts away for only eighth time in 300 yearsThe United Kingdom's longest-lasting patch of snow, located in a remote mountain range in the Scottish Highlands, has melted away for only the eighth time in 300 years, experts have confirmed. The snow patch, nicknamed the Sphinx, is the U.K.'s most durable, which means it typically stays frozen through the summer, even after most snow has melted across the region's upland terrain. The rare disappearance of the patch comes as Scotland plays host to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, during which government officials from around the world...
__label__1 UK Government Approves Coronavirus Vaccines for 12 to 15 Year Olds to ‘Reduce Disruption’ in SchoolsThe UK’s chief medical officer announced on Monday that children from the ages of 12 to 15 years old will be offered coronavirus vaccines in England. Announcing the long-anticipated ruling, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Monday that the government made the decision upon assessing “what effect this will have on transmission in schools and effects on education,” adding: “It’s a useful tool to reduce the disruption.” Children over the age of 12 will be offered a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine “as soon as possible,” England’s deputy CMO Jonathan...
__label__5 Rep. Adam Kinzinger says he’s eyeing potential GOP run for Illinois governor or U.S. senator after opting out of reelection to CongressLess than a week after announcing he would not seek reelection to Congress under a Democratic redistricting map, Republican U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN Thursday he is weighing possible statewide bids for Illinois governor or U.S. senator in next year’s election. In an interview with the network, the six-term Republican from Channahon said he expected to make a decision on a statewide bid “probably” in January. Candidates are scheduled to begin seeking petition signatures Jan. 13 to appear on the June 28 primary ballot. Kinzinger also said he would not rule...
__label__3 Biden heads into international climate negotiations with a weak handOPINIONOn the opening day of the 26th international climate conference in Glasgow, President Joe Biden’s pitch to the world was, more or less, to trust that the US would lead on the climate crisis. Biden originally hoped to arrive in Scotland with a pair of laws in hand that marked the US’s most significant investment ever in the climate crisis. Instead, he brought a smattering of executive actions and pledges, while his main agenda remains a moving target in Congress. It’s almost exactly a year since the Trump administration officially, though...
__label__2 He Was Murdered Over a Lie: What the Killing of Samuel Paty Means for Free ExpressionOPINIONSamuel Paty was decapitated on Oct. 16, 2020, outside the middle school in a north Paris suburb where he had taught history and civics for five years. The murderer, a radical Islamist terrorist, acted because Paty had supposedly shown his class images of the Prophet Mohammed from the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a lesson on free expression in France. The magazine was the target of a high-profile Islamist terrorist attack back in January 2015 that spurred a month’s long wave of jihadi violence across the country. In a...
__label__5 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...
__label__3 Big Oil Climate Denial Hearing Features Even More DenialA landmark congressional hearing to probe the extent to which the oil industry misled the public about global climate change featured executives of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies and industry trade groups further downplaying climate science. “We know the combustion of oil and gas releases greenhouse gases,” Darren Woods, CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil, told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform before misrepresenting the findings of the world’s leading climate science body. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he said, “has concluded that increased greenhouse...

The 9M730 Burevestnik missile, also known as Skyfall by Nato, has been linked to the deaths of at least five scientists in an accident in Nyonoksa, north eastern Russia, that caused a radiation spike 'one thousand times higher than lethal,' last August. Britain's Chief of Defence Intelligence, Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, told a media briefing: 'Moscow is testing a subsonic nuclear-powered cruise...
__label__5 Democrats’ big problem: How to win without Trump to run againstIn the Virginia elections, as well as nationally, we look at the role of negative partisanship. It’s when voters are more motivated by what they dislike in an opponent, than by what they like in their own candidate. Democrats had some blockbuster years in Virginia during Donald Trump’s presidency.  In 2017, Ralph Northam won the governorship by almost 9 points, more than tripling former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s margin from four years earlier. Democrats flipped three of the state’s 11 congressional seats in 2018, and in 2019 took control of the...
__label__3 China at COP26: Beijing's coal addiction is key to climate summitChina is a country of epic contradictions. It is home to the world’s largest solar farm, a rolling ocean of 4 million panels high up in the Tibetan plateau that’s large enough to cover Manhattan. Some 600 miles to the east, in Inner Mongolia, are the belching smokestacks of the Tuoketuo power plant, the world's largest coal-fired power station and one of the biggest single sources of pollution ever created. On Sunday, at the start of COP26, the world may get a clue as to which of China’s two extremes will dominate the coming decades —...
__label__2 The Habsburg MomentANALYSISThe European Union is — maybe — on the verge of its much-discussed “Hamilton moment.” A sweeping Franco-German proposal for a $2 trillion EU coronavirus-recovery program would see the European Union itself raising funds in the credit markets for the first time, essentially making the European Union a new issuer of sovereign debt. Such mutual debt had long been opposed by Germany and other wealthy EU members that dread the possibility of the federation being made into a transfer union in which the affluent north pays the taxes and the...
__label__5 Why education was a top voter priority this electionIt touches most every household in the United States, whether as taxpayers or as parents, but come Election Day, education rarely makes it to the top of voter priorities. That wasn't the case this week. Republican Glenn Youngkin made schools, and particularly parental control, his closing issue in his upset win over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. Between September and October polls, education rose 9 points to be the top issue for voters going into the race, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Parents who wanted more voice...
__label__3 In Germany, global warming is changing more than just the climate. It’s changing politics, too.Layers of dried mud on sidewalks, concrete roads turned to gravel and time-worn stone bridges washed away. Three months after this summer’s catastrophic floods in Germany’s Ahrweiler region, there are reminders everywhere of the destruction they wrought. The deluge, which was preceded by three consecutive summers of drought, has brought a new urgency for many to find climate change solutions — and that has impacted Germany’s politics, too. In last month’s federal election, the environmentalist Green Party had its best results yet, winning nearly 15 percent of the vote, and trailing just behind the two largest parties....
__label__1 EU: ‘End of American-led’ World and Rise of China ‘Happening Before Our Eyes’The European Union’s top diplomat has called for the bloc to have a “more robust strategy” toward China amid signs that Asia is replacing the United States as the centre of global power. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell told a gathering of German ambassadors on Monday that “analysts have long talked about the end of an American-led system and the arrival of an Asian century.” “This is now happening in front of our eyes,” he said. Borrell said the pandemic could be seen as a turning point in the...
__label__4 Voters punish Democrats amid left driftANALYSISFrom Virginia to New Jersey to Minnesota, voters in yesterday's off-year elections sent Democrats a warning for 2022: There could be a massive backlash to perceptions that progressives are pulling the party too far left. Why it matters: Now the finger-pointing begins. President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can use the wake-up call to try to force a reset, starting with swift passage of a long-stalled $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. But the same GOP gains that narrowed Dems' margins or flipped advantages in some swing...
__label__3 'Deluge' in a drought: Millions of Californians warned of flash flooding risk on SundayDrought-stricken regions of Northern California could see "excessive rainfall" — as much as 8-10 inches of rain — when an extreme weather system hits the West Coast this weekend, the National Weather Center warns. Millions of people in Northern California were at some risk for flash floods on Sunday due to the system, known as an "atmospheric river," the Weather Prediction Center said Saturday. Meanwhile, residents of a small swathe of coastal Santa Barbara County were told to evacuate Friday due to mudslide concerns. The weather system is expected to begin hitting the coast on Saturday night....
__label__2 NY Gov. Cuomo Bizarrely Calls COVID-19 a ‘European Virus’New York’s increasingly overexposed Governor Andrew Cuomo today confused and angered China-hawks by referring to COVID-19 as a “European virus”. Speaking at his daily press conference, Gov. Cuomo bizarrely declared: “Yes we have more cases than anyone else. Yes we had this European virus attack us and nobody expected it. But we’re not only going to change our trajectory, we’re going to change the trajectory more dramatically than any place else in the nation.” It’s true. Cuomo did help to change the trajectory of the virus more dramatically than anywhere...
__label__4 In heavily Democratic New Jersey, the governor race is surprisingly closeWhile Democrats were bracing for an upset in Virginia, perhaps the biggest shock out of Tuesday's election was a tight race for governor of deep-blue New Jersey. For months, polls have shown that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy had a comfortable lead — as much as 11 points according to a Monmouth University poll released last week — over Republican Jack Ciattarelli. But the race is too close to call and it could take a week to count mailed ballots. Either campaign can request a recount. Even though Jack Ciattarelli ran in the 2017 Republican primary...
__label__3 The fate of the planet will be negotiated in Glasgow, ScotlandOPINIONAlmost every country in the world signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a monumental accord that aimed to limit global warming. But it was forged on a contradiction: Every signatory agreed that everyone must do something to address the urgent threat of climate change, but no one at the time pledged to do enough. In the years since the agreement, the emissions that trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere have continued to rise. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit global warming this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius, compared to temperatures...
__label__1 Social Distancing During the Black DeathOPINIONOne of the comforts of studying history is that, no matter how bad things get, you can always find a moment in the past when things were much, much worse. Some commentators on our current crisis have been throwing around comparisons to earlier pandemics, and the Black Death of 1347 — 50 inevitably gets mentioned. Please. The Black Death wiped out half the population of Europe in the space of four years. In some places the mortality was far swifter and deadlier than that. The novelist Giovanni Boccaccio, who gave...
__label__5 Fact Checking Donald Trump’s WSJ Letter to the EditorFACT CHECKOn October 27, the Wall Street Journal published a letter to the editor from Donald Trump, responding to “Pennsylvania’s 2020 Election.” In it, Trump maintains that the 2020 election was “rigged.” The former president recycled familiar—and previously debunked—voter fraud claims to make his case. In total, Trump makes 20 allegations of voter fraud, but the basis for most of these claims are not immediately clear.  First, Trump claims that in Pennsylvania “71,893 mail-in ballots were returned after Nov. 3, 2020, at 8 p.m.” He adds: “[N]one of these should have been counted according to...
__label__3 ‘No more time to waste,’ chair of House climate panel warns ahead of Cop26The alarm bells are ringing. A code red has been declared. With no less than the future of the planet at stake, Kathy Castor, chair of the select committee on the climate crisis, has warned Democrats that there is precious little time left to enact the US president’s aggressive climate agenda and avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. “We just don’t have any more time to waste,” the Florida congresswoman said in an interview with the Guardian ahead of crucial UN climate talks in Scotland. “We have got to act now or...
__label__1 Will COVID-19 Mark the End of European Liberalism?OPINIONUnderstandably, given its potential for large scale loss of life and severe economic disruption, coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far focused on its short-term health and economic impact. Eventually, however, we will have to start thinking about the longer-term repercussions of the virus—particularly its political fall-out. According to the social science literature, there appears to be a positive correlation between the prevalence of disease and an increase in authoritarian-nationalist political views.1 This could have important ramifications in continental Europe, where several of the countries at the epicentre of...
__label__5 We’re Tracking Trump’s And Harris’s Popularity Ahead Of The 2024 Presidential Election. (Yes, It’s Early.)ANALYSISFormer President Donald Trump ended his presidency more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. Overall, Trump’s unfavorability — now that he’s out of office we’re tracking his favorability numbers rather than his approval rating, both of which capture popularity — has remained steady just as his low approval...
__label__3 Money For Green Energy Creates More Jobs Than Fossil Fuel Investment, New Study FindsAs Congress debates whether to pare down the Biden administration’s signature climate proposals or allow the fossil fuel industry to benefit more from new government programs, new research suggests doing so would create far fewer jobs. For every million dollars the United States government invests, solar produces over 2.7 times more jobs than fossil fuels, according to an analysis from two environmental think tanks and a labor union. Wind energy spurs over 2.8 times more jobs than investments in oil, gas and coal. And retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient creates demand for...
__label__2 Trump announces travel ban from Europe amid growing fears of coronavirusPresident Trump announced Wednesday that he will be suspending all travel from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days starting Friday at midnight in an effort to quell the spread of coronavirus. His address from the Oval Office comes hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic and the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. climbed to more than 1,000. Trump said the new travel exemptions do not apply to the United Kingdom. He reiterated that travel restrictions from China -- the epicenter of the virus,...
__label__5 High Energy Prices Likely to Mean Less Oil Demand This Year, OPEC SaysSoaring energy prices are likely to crimp demand for oil in some of the world’s fastest-growing economies this year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Thursday. In a closely watched monthly market report, OPEC said global demand for oil would grow by 5.7 million barrels a day this year, 160,000 barrels a day less than it expected last month. The revision means the oil-producers group now expects demand for oil in 2021 to total 96.4 million barrels a day. Soaring fuel costs amid a global energy crunch were showing signs of...
__label__3 Huntington Beach Has Reopened, But the Aftermath of the Oil Spill Is Far From OverANALYSISSurf’s up at Huntington Beach, 10 days after a major oil spill spoiled the waters off California’s southern coast. The popular surf spot reopened Monday after city officials and California State Parks announced in a statement that “water quality testing results showed non-detectable amounts of oil associated toxins in our ocean water.” As my colleague Piper McDaniel reported last week, the ocean floor accident has exposed a complicated web of responsibility: An estimated 144,000 gallons of oil gushed into the sea over the weekend before Amplify Energy Corp., owner of the ruptured pipeline, shut...

__label__5 Why are oil prices so high? And what can be done about it?ANALYSISPresident Joe Biden faced an awkward moment during the international climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, when he was asked at a press conference about inflation back home, including gasoline prices. “If you take a look at gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil,” Biden said Nov. 2 at the United Nations’ COP26 summit. “And we’ll see what happens on that score sooner than later.” OPEC is the group of 13...
__label__3 Major Climate Action at Stake in Fight Over Twin Bills Pending in CongressPresident Biden has framed this moment as the country’s best chance to save the planet. “The nation and the world are in peril,” he said weeks ago in Queens, where 11 people drowned in their basement apartments after floodwaters from Hurricane Ida devastated communities from Louisiana to New York. “And that’s not hyperbole. That is a fact. They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living in it real time now.” Mr. Biden’s plan to try to fortify the United States against extreme weather — and...

VERDICT: WTF is he talking about? As of this week, almost 350,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Biden's watch at an average rate of 1,172 per day. That is more than the combined total of American combat deaths in the First and Second World Wars. It is the...
__label__5 U.S. unveils roadmap for net-zero aviation emissions by 2050The Transportation Department is unveiling a multi-agency roadmap to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector with a target of reaching net-zero by 2050. Why it matters: Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, but has other warming impacts too. It accounts for 11% of U.S. transportation-related emissions, according to the White House. Those emissions are projected to rise a lot in coming decades alongside the growth of air travel, absent aggressive adoption of climate-friendly tech. In a hypothetical case of technology frozen in place, the strategy...

Cindy Axne (D-IA) claimed last week that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will cost Iowans “literally nothing.” VERDICT: False. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will stick Americans with trillions more in debt. “This cost Iowans literally nothing,” Rep. Axne said of the far-left’s agenda during an interview on Let’s Talk Guthrie County. “If you’re making under $400,000, you know what you’re going to get? A tax break. Because this bill is literally the first time in a long time that we’ve had a substantial approach to helping working...
__label__4 COP26: What's the climate impact of private jets?FACT CHECKThere has been criticism of the number of world leaders and other delegates who have travelled to the COP26 summit in private jets. How much environmental damage do they do - and did leaders have any choice? Plane spotters at Prestwick Airport in South Ayrshire have been enjoying the unusual range of aircraft arriving there. And it hasn't just been those ferrying the leaders themselves - there have been cargo aircraft arriving, carrying helicopters and vehicles for motorcades. We know, for example, that President Biden has one of his armoured vehicles,...
__label__3 ‘Eco’ wood stoves emit 750 times more pollution than an HGV, study showsNew wood burning stoves billed as more environmentally friendly still emit 750 times more tiny particle pollution than a modern HGV truck, a report has shown. Only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold from the start of 2022 in the UK and EU, but experts said the regulation was shockingly weak. The report used data on the emissions produced by stoves in perfect laboratory conditions and the pollution could be even higher in everyday use, the researchers said, with older stoves being much worse. Tiny particle...
__label__2 For Whom Do the Covid “Fact Checkers” Really Work?OPINIONThere are two types of COVID19 survivors— those who have documented recovery from sars-cov-2 (either PCR, antigen or serology + tests) or those who have self-identified recovery from sars-cov 2 (said they had it). When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...
__label__4 Will China’s energy crisis dampen its effort to cut emissions?China will play a key role in whether the world can curb global warming. But it’s also an industrial powerhouse, and recent electricity shortages reveal challenges ahead in balancing economic and environmental goals. Liu Rui, a university student in Tonghua, a city in Jilin province, felt anxious. A sudden, widespread power outage across northeastern China had left her family without electricity to cook or heat water, and her laptop’s battery was running out before an online class. “I was always worried the internet would suddenly disconnect during class,” says Ms....
__label__3 We Reported on Pollution From Sugar Cane Burning. Now Federal Lawmakers Want the EPA to Take Action.For years, residents living amid Florida’s sugar fields have complained about pre-harvest crop burning, which sends smoke and ash into their communities. And for years, state health and environmental officials, as well as sugar companies, have said the air is healthy to breathe. But now, leading lawmakers in Congress are calling for a federal investigation into how the state has tracked air quality while also pressing to tighten the nation’s pollution standards, in response to an investigation by The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica that found a series of shortcomings in how...
__label__1 Beware People Trying to Dismiss Jack Dorsey's Inflation Analysis as DisinformationANALYSISI hope you squirreled away that cool 16 cents you saved on your Fourth of July barbeque this year. Across the board, prices seem to be going up, up, up. Gas is more expensive (up 42.7 percent). Cars and trucks, too (up 7.6 percent for new and 31.9 percent (!) for used). Your wallet is surely feeling the burn at the grocery store (up 3 percent). Meat, in particular, is getting really expensive (up 10.5 percent), to the sure delight of the anti-animal food crusaders out there. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official measure of...
__label__5 Biden’s big climate policy died. But that’s not the whole story.ANALYSISAmerica’s political commentary about climate change has been rather gloomy recently. Core parts of President Joe Biden’s climate plan have crumbled in the face of Washington political realities. This month, the lack of one key Senate vote in his own party forced the president to scrap a clean electricity proposal that supporters had described as essential for lowering the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Now that same lawmaker, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, is reportedly opposing another climate component of the Build Back Better Act, this one involving fees on emissions of methane, a gas with even more planet-warming...
__label__2 EPA shuts polluting Caribbean refinery reopened under TrumpThe Environmental Protection Agency has ordered an oil refinery in the US Virgin Islands to pause all operations, citing “at least four incidents” in which the facility that significantly affected St Croix residents. The Limetree Bay refinery, which caused a massive oil spill in the 1980s, first reopened in February under an order from the Trump administration, after eight years idle. “These repeated incidents at the refinery have been and remain totally unacceptable,” said the EPA head, Michael Reagan, noting that residents in St Croix are “already overburdened” by pollution...
__label__2 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__5 UN emissions gap report a 'thundering wake-up call'National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. Their Emissions Gap report says country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. Just a few days before COP26 opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is "another thundering wake-up...
__label__3 After four years of inaction, the EPA is finally regulating this superpollutantANALYSISCarbon dioxide gets the fame and attention of the greenhouse gases. But there are others that are even more effective at trapping heat; they just exist in much smaller concentrations, so they don’t usually face the same level of scrutiny or regulation. The United States is finally taking aim at an important type of these lesser-known superpollutants: hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are used in air conditioners and refrigerators. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a rule on Monday, first reported by the New York Times’s Lisa Friedman, that it will phase...
__label__1 Washington Post fact-checker calls asking about Biden visiting the border 'a bit of a gotcha question'Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler seemed to dismiss the ongoing inquires of whether or not President Biden has gone to the southern border and if he has any intention of visiting in the future.  Biden raised eyebrows on Thursday at CNN's town hall when he was asked by an attendee why he hadn't been to the southern border as president.  He responded by saying he had "been there before" but admitted "I guess I should go down" before pointing to his busy schedule that has prevented the visit and touting a trip to the border...
__label__5 Does nuclear power have a place in a green-energy future?Countries around the world have set ambitious goals to fight climate change by drastically reducing their emissions in the coming decades. Doing so means replacing carbon-heavy power sources, like coal and gas, with green-energy solutions. Renewables like solar, wind and hydroelectric power will certainly play a major role. But environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers are divided on whether or not nuclear power should be part of a clean-energy future. In the 1980s, nuclear power provided about 17 percent of the world’s energy. But high-profile disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl led many countries to stop investing...
__label__3 Federal lead-pipe rule overhauled for first time in decadesFor the first time in three decades, the federal government on Tuesday overhauled a rule aimed at reducing lead in drinking water across the country — a long-standing scourge made worse by the nation’s weathered and crumbling infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency’s lead and copper rule, widely criticized as complicated, poorly enforced and too weak to protect the health of many Americans, has not been revised since 1991, when George H.W. Bush was president. The 409-page updated version will for the first time require water utilities to test for lead...
__label__2 CNN Fact Checks Biden’s Town Hall But Neglects Claim That Multi-Trillion-Dollar Agenda Will Cost $0President Joe Biden made some false claims at his town hall with moderator Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, prompting the CNN Newsroom to fact check a few of his statements. Responding to concerns about the southern border Biden stated, “I’ve been there before. I know it well.”  Later, he conceded, “I guess I should go down but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole lot of time to get down.”   CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pushed back against this claim, stating that he “could not find any...
__label__5 Solar panels make money in rural America. They don’t always make friends.Before the end of the year, a colossal, 1,800-acre solar farm will begin delivering its full stream of power from farm fields west of Flint, Michigan. It’s the largest solar installation in the state, by far, and a key driver toward Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal to decarbonize the Midwestern state’s electrical grid, which is still dominated by coal.  The problem with the project: Many locals hate it.  “We’re sick of these ridiculous-looking panels. We don’t like them,” says Jim Sheridan. He lives across the road from the installation in...
__label__3 Trump Made Cars Pollute Again and It'll Take Biden Years to Reverse ItANALYSISIn late November, while most of the GOP was refusing to call Joe Biden “president-elect,” General Motors CEO Mary Barra effectively called the race: she withdrew from a lawsuit about California’s ability to set strict fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards, and challenged the CEOs of other automakers to do the same.“We are immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation and inviting other automakers to join us,” Barra wrote in a letter to the heads of 11 environmental organizations.
__label__1 CNN Forced to Fact Check Joe Biden's CNN Town HallANALYSISOn Thursday night amid multiple crises of his administration's creation, President Joe Biden joined CNN for a town hall event hosted by Anderson Cooper and it went about as well as you could expect for a septuagenarian up past his bed time.  The morning after Biden and Cooper's conversation, though, CNN itself published a fact check of what Biden claimed on the stage in Baltimore. When asked about the U.S.-Mexico border — at which an unmitigated illegal immigration crisis is raging — the president said "I've been there before, and...
__label__5 Automakers are spending billions to produce battery cells for EVs in the U.S.As supply chains remain in distress across the globe, automakers are spending billions to move production of battery cells to their home countries to meet what’s expected to be rapidly growing demand for electric vehicles over the next decade. Automakers from Detroit to Japan plan to simplify supply chains to lower costs, ease logistics and avoid massive disruptions. A global shortage of semiconductor chips has highlighted the industry’s reliance on overseas manufacturers for the parts. Those based in or that have large operations in the U.S. are also hoping to appease the Biden...

A look at Trump's rollbacks and their long term effects nationwide. Cherise Harris noticed a change in her eldest daughter soon after the family moved a block away from a 132-year-old coal-fired power plant in Painesville, Ohio. The teen’s asthma attacks occurred more frequently, Harris said, and she started carrying an inhaler with her at all times. The family didn’t know it at the time, but Painesville’s municipal-owned plant emits nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide – two pollutants that the...
__label__2 Yes, Biden Is Proposing That the IRS Spy on Your Bank RecordsOPINIONHere’s yet another example of why “fact-checking” is the most dishonest form of journalism. To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...
__label__4 Biden's carbon emissions-cutting pledge faces tough climbANALYSISThe verdict is in: President Biden's U.S. emissions-cutting pledge isn't a fantasy, but the path to meeting it is very difficult and relies on forces outside of White House control. Driving the news: The Rhodium Group just released an analysis of policy combinations that could close the gap between the current U.S. trajectory and Biden's vow under the Paris Agreement to cut emissions in half by 2030. Why it matters: It's the most detailed analysis I've seen of what's needed to translate the pledge into policy specifics — and it's quite a lot. It...
__label__3 Air pollution is much worse than we thoughtANALYSISIn the late 1960s, the US saw regular, choking smog descend over New York City and Los Angeles, 100,000 barrels of oil spilled off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, and, perhaps most famously, fires burning on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio. These grim images sparked the modern environmental movement, the first Earth Day, and a decade of extraordinary environmental lawmaking and rulemaking (much of it under a Republican president, Richard Nixon). From the ’70s through the beginning of the 21st century, the fight against fossil fuels...

This week, we examine calls for the mainstream media to be more critical of Republicans, analyze the media’s coverage of the death of Colin Powell, and highlight more media misses. Journalists are Telling on Themselves Reporters from several mainstream-media outlets outed themselves as biased conduits of information over the weekend when they excitedly promoted a Los Angeles Times column that argued journalists are “failing the public with ‘both-siderism’ in political coverage.” Columnist Jackie Calmes laments how “journalist pressure” to be balanced...
__label__5 Clean tech could be worth more than oil by 2030ANALYSISGlobal investment in clean energy technologies is still far below where it needs to be for the world to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to a major new report from the International Energy Agency. To close the gap, annual investment for the rest of this decade needs to be three times higher than it was in 2021. The size of this gap has two important implications. First, for every year that goes by without a significant scale-up in investment, the gap for future years will be even greater, and the odds...

Two days before President Barack Obama left office, the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered that the stacks be continuously monitored for arsenic, lead, mercury and other harmful metals that the 78-year-old Cosey blames for the health problems of her three great-grandchildren. It was a victory environmental groups took more...
__label__2 The New York Times Spreads Misinformation About COVID-19ANALYSISThe purported threat of social media has emerged once again as a top concern of senators, whistleblowers, and members of the press. They are very, very worried about Facebook fanning the flames of hate, compromising U.S. democracy, and spreading COVID misinformation. How many of them are worried about the COVID misinformation being spread by The New York Times? The paper of record had to print a lengthy correction to a big error in a Thursday news article. The story was about other countries' approaches to vaccinating young people, and whether one shot would be better than...
__label__5 Ford announces $11.4bn investment in electric vehicle plantsFord has announced a major investment in electric vehicle (EV) production in the US, promising to build its biggest ever factory in Tennessee, and two battery parks in Kentucky. Under the $11.4bn (£8.3bn) plan, the carmaker said it will build zero-emission cars and pickups "at scale" for American customers. It will also create 11,000 jobs. Like rivals GM and Stellantis, Ford hopes around half of the cars it sells by 2030 will be zero emission. Yet the additional government investment required to make it happen is still in question....

Zero. Zero,” Biden insisted during an appearance in Michigan on Tuesday in a speech promoting his infrastructure bill and his “Build Back Better” entitlement spending proposal. The president repeated his widely-mocked “zero” cost talking point, even though fact checkers from the establishment media have called him out on the dubious claim. Even the Washington Post‘s Glenn Kessler gave Biden “Two Pinocchios”...
__label__4 China power crunch spreads, shutting factories and dimming growth outlookWidening power shortages in China have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying Apple and Tesla, while some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted. China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage. Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since...
__label__3 The E.P.A.’s Review of Mercury Rules Could Remake Its Methods for Valuing Human Life and HealthWhen writing environmental rules, one of the most important calculations involves weighing the financial costs against any gains in human life and health.

__label__2 Psaki Says Trump Was Silent on Human Rights Abuses in ChinaANALYSISCLAIM: President Joe Biden, unlike President Donald Trump, has spoken out against human rights abuses in China. VERDICT: FALSE. The Trump administration accused China of genocide; meanwhile, Biden has been soft on China. White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed Wednesday that President Biden had spoken out against human rights abuses in China — whereas, she said, President Trump did not. In response to a question about whether the Biden administration was overlooking China’s genocide of Uighur Muslims as it sought cooperation with the communist government on climate change, Psaki...
__label__4 China vows end to building coal-fired power plants abroadChinese President Xi Jinping told the UN General Assembly Tuesday that his country "will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad" and plans to boost support for clean energy in developing nations. Why it matters: The pledge, if maintained, would mark a breakthrough in efforts to transition global power away from the most carbon-emitting fuel. Nations, including the U.S., have been urging China — historically a key source of coal-plant finance — to make such a commitment. Xi's pledge on coal financing comes just weeks before a critical UN climate summit....

__label__1 Public Health Officials Blew Up Their Credibility, and We're Paying the PriceOPINIONWith COVID-19 still sickening and killing people even though effective vaccines have been widely available for all since the spring, it's frustrating to see vaccination rates creep up only slowly against a head-wind of widespread resistance. It's even more frustrating that much of that resistance can be attributed to self-inflicted wounds on the part of public health experts and government officials. Having effectively discarded their own credibility since the beginning of the pandemic, the powers-that-be find that much of the population no longer places faith in what they have to say. "Why...

I tried for a year to reach someone at Facebook to fix things, but Facebook wouldn’t. Here’s the problem: Facebook uses “independent fact-checkers” to try to reduce fake news on its site. That’s a noble goal. Unfortunately, at least one Facebook “fact-checker” is a climate-alarmist group that cleverly uses its Facebook connections to stop debate. Facebook is a private company. It has every right to cut me off. But Facebook does not have the right to just lie...
__label__5 Climate change: Do individual actions really matter?A sobering report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released last week placed blame for rising global temperatures squarely on human activity and predicted even more severe weather in the coming years unless drastic measures are taken to reduce global emissions. “How hot it gets is still up to us,” Kim Cobb, one of the lead authors of the report told Yahoo Finance. The new report adds to an overwhelming volume of scientific evidence that major changes must be made at every level of the world economy to prevent already-extreme...

That’s the message emanating from the White House and the corporate press. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced last week that, due to 12 unnamed people on social media posting what the Biden administration considers to be misinformation, the White House is actively “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation” and “helping” to “boost trusted content.” Going even...

But check out how NPR discusses the conservative outlet The Daily Wire and pundit Ben Shapiro. It's a case study in people's eagerness to classify writing they disagree with as "misinformation," whether or not it's factually accurate.

Environment ministers from the G20 nations met on July 23 in Italy, and although they don’t have a better plan for confronting the climate crisis, we all have a clearer view of the deep geopolitical fissures standing in the way of that goal. Chief among them: Setting a deadline to phase out the use of coal. The idea of a deadline to phase out coal—after which rich countries would no longer burn coal in power plants or factories, or finance the construction of...

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL) are doing something the liberal media hates: speaking out. They’re on tour right now, and it’s driving the liberal media insane. Both complement each other with regards to their ability to stir up controversy. The pair adds zest to the American political scene, though in many other ways they go off half-cocked, making statements and declarations that are simply wrong. Still, these two were elected and I’m certainly not on the bandwagon of booting people on the basis that some DC...

It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.

That stands for the international goal of trying to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s a somewhat confusing number in some ways that wasn’t a major part of negotiations just seven years ago and was a political suggestion that later proved to be incredibly important scientifically. Stopping warming at 1.5 or so can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms...

__label__4 Climate summit: The key is momentum, even if progress is slowThe COP26 climate summit may make no breakthroughs, but global public opinion is demanding a behavior change that technology now permits. That will make itself felt after the meeting. There are two ways of looking at the crucial climate change conference currently underway in Glasgow, Scotland. Through the narrow lens of politics – gauging the prospects of a landmark deal to make good on the unfulfilled promise of the 2015 Paris Agreement – the picture looks distinctly unpromising. Even the summit host, the habitually bullish British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,...
__label__3 Exclusive: EPA's Pruitt vows to continue rolling back rules despite alarming climate reportEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said a newly released government report that lays most of the blame for the rise of global temperatures to human activity won't deter him from continuing to roll back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a major rule aimed at combating climate change.
__label__1 The Washington Post Memory-Holed Kamala Harris' Bad Joke About Inmates Begging for Food and WaterANALYSISWhen The Washington Post published a 2019 campaign trail feature about then-presidential hopeful Kamala Harris' close relationship with her sister, it opened with a memorable anecdote in which Harris bizarrely compared the rigors of the campaign trail to…life behind bars. And then proceeded to laugh—at the idea of an inmate begging for a sip of water. It was an extremely cringeworthy moment, even by the high standards set by Harris' failed presidential campaign. But now that Harris is vice president, that awful moment has seemingly vanished from the Post's website...
__label__5 Saving the Amazon, one wood-carved spoon at a timePledges at global conferences such as COP26 to halt deforestation are all well and good. But they are worthless unless they translate into ground-level action like this venture. Jackeane dos Santos Leite leans over a thin plank of wood, her brow furrowed above her plastic goggles. Carefully, she traces the shape of a spatula before powering up a small electric saw. “I’ve only used this one a few times,” she says through the cloud of sawdust, her hands unsteady as she cuts into the tauari, or Brazilian oak wood. “The shape...
__label__3 E.P.A. Promised ‘a New Day’ for the Agriculture Industry, Documents RevealIn the weeks before the Environmental Protection Agency decided to reject its own scientists’ advice to ban a potentially harmful pesticide, Scott Pruitt, the agency’s head, promised farming industry executives who wanted to keep using the pesticide that it is “a new day, and a new future,” and that he was listening to their pleas.

The measures will target methane leaking from oil and gas rigs across the US. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities. A global partnership to cut methane is to be announced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on Tuesday. Dozens of countries have joined the initiative led by the US and the EU to cut...
__label__3 Scott Pruitt Is Carrying Out His E.P.A. Agenda in Secret, Critics SayWhen career employees of the Environmental Protection Agency are summoned to a meeting with the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, at agency headquarters, they no longer can count on easy access to the floor where his office is, according to interviews with employees of the federal agency.
__label__2 COVID-19 Vaccination Should Not Be Legally Required for ParenthoodOPINIONA family court judge in Chicago denied a mother the right to custody over her son until she gets vaccinated against COVID-19, the implication being that an unvaccinated parent is not a fit parent. The ruling didn't hold long—the judge himself quickly reversed course—but the initial decision will be chilling for thousands of parents across the country. Making parental or child vaccination a requirement for custody would be an enormous judicial and government overreach, setting a dangerous precedent for intervention into what has traditionally been the realm of the family. This case...

But continued haggling in Congress over legislation to advance his climate goals threatens to undermine that message on the world stage. Biden leaves for Europe on Thursday for a G20 meeting in Rome followed by a gathering of world leaders in Glasgow aimed at saving the planet from the devastation wreaked by rising temperatures. Biden had hoped to showcase legislation designed to fulfill a U.S. pledge...

__label__2 Drafting Our DaughtersOPINIONLast week, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a provision, to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act, that would require women to register with Selective Service, that is, the military draft. This is a grave mistake, but not a surprising one. Requiring women to register with the Selective Service has long been avoided by lawmakers, even as they have gradually eliminated exclusions aimed at shielding women from exposure to direct combat, in part due to its abiding unpopularity. In 2016, however, the last of these restrictions was removed, opening combat arms...
__label__4 UN emissions gap report a 'thundering wake-up call'National plans to cut carbon fall far short of what's needed to avert dangerous climate change, according to the UN Environment Programme. Their Emissions Gap report says country pledges will fail to keep the global temperature under 1.5C this century. The Unep analysis suggests the world is on course to warm around 2.7C with hugely destructive impacts. But there is hope that, if long term net-zero goals are met, temperatures can be significantly reined in. Just a few days before COP26 opens in Glasgow, another scientific report on climate change is "another thundering wake-up...
__label__3 The radical idea behind Trump’s EPA rollbacksThe Trump administration isn’t just pushing to dramatically shrink the Environmental Protection Agency, chop a third of its budget and hobble its regulatory powers.

__label__2 Fatherless, America's Top Domestic ProblemOPINIONA new powerful new documentary called "The Streets Were My Father" features three Chicago men, two Hispanics and one Black, who grew up without fathers. All three did hard time for serious offenses, including murder. The film, with no narrator, just lets the men talk. None blames "systemic racism." All concede they made bad choices, but choices nonetheless. All talked about the pain they felt growing up without a father figure to instruct, scold, guide, motivate and instill confidence and direction. I highly recommend it. In Barack Obama's first book,...
__label__5 Does nuclear power have a place in a green-energy future?Countries around the world have set ambitious goals to fight climate change by drastically reducing their emissions in the coming decades. Doing so means replacing carbon-heavy power sources, like coal and gas, with green-energy solutions. Renewables like solar, wind and hydroelectric power will certainly play a major role. But environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers are divided on whether or not nuclear power should be part of a clean-energy future. In the 1980s, nuclear power provided about 17 percent of the world’s energy. But high-profile disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl led many countries to stop investing...

But she’s not going to fall back on a tactic that’s all-too-familiar to most parents who have an out-of-sorts toddler. The cellphone stays in her purse. That’s not a tool the Roy, Utah, mom will use to mollify him.

As the tale goes, in the late 1930s or early 40s, a distant relative eloped with one of La Nacha’s daughters. But La Nacha did not approve of this marriage and, as the head of one of the first Mexican drug syndicates based in Juarez, she ordered that the relative be shot. He survived, and fled Texas, where he died of natural causes decades later in another state....

__label__2 Conservatives Need A Pro-Family Agenda Beyond Tax CreditsOPINIONFor decades, discussions of “family policy” in the U.S. have been associated with the broader liberal agenda, from raising the minimum wage to universal childcare and paid leave mandates. The default conservative response has been to resort to the usual talking points: too expensive, too heavy-handed, too much of a threat to liberty. But as Republicans search for a political identity after four years of the Trump administration, the old rhetoric rings hollow. Focusing on boosting GDP growth and letting the market take care of the rest is no longer...

If special counsel John Durham has cracked the core of the Russiagate case, if he has established that the Steele dossier on which the FBI substantially based its spy warrants was fraudulent, does that mean he is nearing a sweeping conspiracy indictment? Will there be criminal charges that target the real 2016 collusion — not between the Trump campaign and Russia, but between the Clinton campaign and U.S. officials who abused government investigative powers for political purposes? Almost certainly not. All signs are that Durham will end...

After the court ruled in 2017 that part of an Obama-rule regarding the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) was too far reaching, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspended the entire rule without giving the public time to weigh in. A federal court in Washington, D.C., determined in a 2-1 decision that this was unlawful and...

I understand the choice to hold Black stories apart from the larger American narrative, to give them the space they deserve, at least once a year. But elevating Black history in February has ironically also been a way to elevate racial denial. In...

Those remarks are bad news for anybody who is worried about federal overreach. The events of January 6, Wray said, prove "a willingness by some to...

But once he attended a small Black Baptist church in the Mississippi Delta, he found a home. Located in a former warehouse, the church had concrete floors, metal folding chairs for pews and an elderly congregation of only about 12 people. What they lacked in size, though, they made up for in spiritual fervor. When members of the...
__label__2 FBI Knew Of Hunter Biden’s Missing Laptop As Early As December 2019ANALYSISThe FBI had knowledge that a second laptop had been stolen from Hunter Biden and that laptop contained material making the Biden family a national security risk, subject to Russian influence. The FBI knew as early as December 2019 that Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen his laptop, which he believed made him vulnerable to blackmail because of compromising evidence on the laptop combined with his father’s presidential ambitions. This explosive revelation establishes that either Joe Biden lied to the American public, or the intelligence community lied to him. When...
__label__5 Energy Companies Set to Get Reprieve on Methane RulesWASHINGTON—The Trump administration is moving to erase Obama-era rules on methane emissions from the oil-and-gas business, saying the federal government overstepped its authority when it set limits on what scientists say is a significant contributor to climate change. The sweeping proposal, formally introduced Wednesday, is the administration’s latest attempt to further boost record crude-oil and natural-gas production by easing regulations. But it comes amid growing concerns over how the industry’s methane emissions are affecting the climate and stark divisions among companies over whether to regulate them.
__label__3 Did Biden Revoke $250M That Trump Pledged to Historically Black Colleges?FACT CHECKIn early February 2021, social media users shared a copypasta meme spreading the baseless rumor that U.S. President Joe Biden had revoked millions of dollars in funding from the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), a charitable organization that provides scholarships for Black higher education students and institutions, which former President Donald Trump had pledged to give to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) over the next 10 years. We found no evidence of any truth to this claim. It appears to be a case of a rumor spread by way...
__label__2 Tucker Carlson suggests undercover FBI agents may have orchestrated Capitol riotFox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that undercover FBI agents helped orchestrate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. “But strangely, some people who participated in the riot haven't been charged. Look at the documents. The government calls these people ‘unindicted co-conspirators.’ What does that mean? It means that in potentially every case, they're FBI operatives,” Carlson said during a Tuesday segment of Tucker Carlson Tonight. “For example, one of those ‘unindicted co-conspirators’ is someone the government identifies only as ‘Person Two.’ According to those documents, Person Two stayed in the same hotel room as an ‘insurrectionist’...
__label__5 Democratic presidential hopeful Klobuchar proposes revamping EPA ethanol rulesDemocratic presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar on Saturday called for revamping the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rules governing how refineries use ethanol in gasoline products, a proposal aimed at the politically critical state of Iowa.

She called for new compliance standards and additional oversight. Klobuchar is one...

One factor that many believe played a role: online misinformation about the Democratic candidate. It’s still too early to know exactly why these voters favored Trump, a candidate who made demonizing Latino immigrants a cornerstone of his campaign and administration. For one, Latinos in the US are a diverse...

The lesson: Along with vaccines, it pays to unleash enormous amounts of public money in the face of a livelihood-destroying health crisis. Europe provided less relief and ended up in a so-called double-dip recession in the first three months of the year, a reality confirmed on Friday by an official estimate showing that the eurozone economy contracted by 0.6 percent.

Four months earlier, Mr. Elsässer had attended a march in Berlin, where a breakaway mob of far-right protesters tried — and failed — to force their way into the building that houses Germany’s Parliament. The parallel was not lost on him.

But it could have been over so much sooner if not for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Let's start with where we're at. After spiking over the winter, new coronavirus cases and deaths have both dropped dramatically—not to zero, but enough that, in combination with vaccines, local leaders are lifting many pandemic restrictions.  Even deep-blue cities and states that put in place the strictest pandemic restrictions are moving rapidly toward reopening. In Washington,...

Although the year showed the scale of the effort needed -- with temperatures rising despite lockdowns across the world that brought most economies to a virtual standstill -- Danish Climate Minister Dan Jorgensen says there’s cause to be more upbeat. He points to the EU’s latest climate deal and the U.S. election, which will bring the world’s biggest economy back...
__label__2 The FDA’s Political InoculationOPINIONThe U.K. on Wednesday approved Pfizer -BioNTech’s vaccine, and no doubt many Americans are wondering as thousands die each day why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wasn’t first. Blame politicians who promoted public skepticism of a vaccine that U.S. regulators now feel they must remedy. Two weeks ago Pfizer and BioNTech applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization of their vaccine, which they reported was 95% effective. The FDA then scheduled an online public meeting on Dec. 10 with outside experts to discuss the authorization and allowed the...

__label__5 Harvard v. Affirmative Action: Round 2This Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn Thursday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Harvard's affirmative action policy does not violate civil rights law. Last year, a federal judge had originally ruled that Harvard did not discriminate based on race and the plaintiffs appealed that decision shortly thereafter. Harvard argued that it considers race as one of many factors in its admissions process (which is allowed under current law) while the plaintiffs argued that Harvard systematically discriminated against Asian Americans. The plaintiffs for this case were represented by the non-profit Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA). SFFA founder Edward Blum has indicated interest in bringing the case forward to the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The SFFA has cases pending against the University of North Carolina and the University of Texas. In related news, citizens of California (a state in which affirmative action is banned) recently voted to continue to ban affirmative action for public employment, education, and contracting.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from For Harvard Policies to Against Harvard PoliciesHarvard vs. Asian-AmericansTwitter Thread from Nancy LeongStatement by American Council on EducationHarvard Wins ...

__label__2 Is the FDA Too Cautious in Its Approach for Approving COVID-19 Vaccines?ANALYSIS"The vaccines are coming momentarily," asserted President Donald Trump in his post-hospitalization video yesterday. The same day the White House reportedly first blocked and then scrambled to approve under pressure the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed guideline that COVID-19 clinical trial vaccine recipients be followed for two months to evaluate vaccines' safety before they can be approved for inoculating millions of Americans. The justification for first blocking the FDA guidance appears to be that that timeline would make it essentially impossible for a COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by...
__label__5 Why did Democrats come up short with Latino voters?Even if Joe Biden can pull off a narrow victory over Donald Trump in the presidential race, the 2020 election is still likely to be considered a disappointment for Democrats. The party’s ambitions to take control of the Senate, expand their majority in the house of Representatives and flip state legislatures appear to have been dashed. A significant reason for Democrats’ disappointment — or Republican successes, depending on your point of view — was the GOP’s improved performance with Latino voters in key swing states. Biden won the lion’s share...

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have called on the Food and Drug Administration to classify the abortion pill RU-486, also known as mifepristone, as an “imminent hazard to the public health.” “It is by now nakedly obvious that the abortion industry and its allies in the media, billionaire philanthropic circles, and special interest groups, have wanted an unregulated and de-medicalized abortion pill since the moment the FDA first approved it in 2000,” wrote Cruz and others in a letter sent this week to FDA...

It could be said that general interest magazines, like motion picture and network entertainment programming, have historically failed to embrace America as a diverse nation. A case in point: It was not until 1930 that Time featured a Black person on the cover; Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie, who was also the news magazine’s Man of...

As a former KGB officer, he is comfortable operating in fog and obfuscation, particularly when twisting the law—or even hatching a political plot. This is essentially what Mr Putin has been doing for the two months since he announced constitutional changes designed to keep himself in power after 2024. The current constitution says he must leave office then. As he indicated on March 10th, he has no intention of doing so.

On Thursday afternoon, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it will be removing the outdated, antiquated restriction that currently bars gay and bisexual men who have been sexually active within one year from donating blood. This will undoubtedly help ease the blood donation shortage caused by the coronavirus crisis, as fewer people have been willing to leave their homes to go donate,...

The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona. It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden’s Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes. In November 2021, the same misleading Maricopa County audit post was shared again, thrusting it back into the spotlight. For example, it was shared by...

Chinese President Xi Jinping, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron joined EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel in a video conference to conclude negotiations over the deal, which removes a number of barriers to European companies' investment in China.

Times reporter Aaron Krolik tested the system by writing a fake nasty post about himself on one such site, and watched it metastasize across the internet. Companies offering “reputation management” can charge upwards of $20,000 to scrub such false reports from the internet. The unverified claims are on obscure, ridiculous-looking sites, but search engines give them a veneer of...

Israel was among the countries battling a new spike, announcing a three-week lockdown from Friday when people will not be allowed more than 500 metres from their homes.

__label__3 False vaccine claims persist on Facebook, despite a ban. Here’s whyANALYSISIn the early days of the pandemic, a Facebook page for Earthley promised an easy way to avoid getting COVID-19. The wellness company promoted a Vitamin D cream and an elderberry elixir to strengthen the body’s immune response and "help fight off the possibility of you or your family getting the coronavirus."  The post appeared to violate Facebook’s policy for false claims of coronavirus treatments and cures. It was serious enough that the Federal Trade Commission mentioned it in a warning letter amid the agency’s crackdown on coronavirus scams....

Another worker who pointed out violations during the vote-counting was fired on the spot. In the small city of Vitebsk, a poll worker signed a document with falsified results in favor of President Alexander Lukashenko and later was wracked with guilt for betraying the trust of the voters.

The findings suggest that far-right pages have an advantage energizing followers on the world’s biggest social network. “My takeaway is that, one way or another, far-right misinformation sources are able to engage on Facebook with their audiences much, much more than any other category,” Laura Edelson, a researcher at NYU’s Cybersecurity...

On Monday morning, Thomas issued a startling opinion ranting against the alleged dangers of mail voting and declaring that SCOTUS must override state courts that expand vote-by-mail pursuant to their state constitutions. Trump may be out of office, but his staunchest ally on the U.S. Supreme Court is carrying on his assault on the legitimacy of the election. Thomas’ grievances arise out of two identical challenges to...
__label__2 The Pandemic Exposed Deep Problems in the Meat IndustryWe all remember the shortages that defined the early days of coronavirus lockdowns. Retail outlets responded as quickly as possible to shortages of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and disinfectants. But then the supply chain disruptions hit the meat department of supermarkets everywhere. Consumers encountered empty coolers instead of packages of chicken or steak, and what was available was more expensive. Frustrations mounted.  But customers weren’t the only angry ones; ranchers are also mad. It’s a little counterintuitive—hamburger prices increased from as low as $1.84 a pound to more than...

Even as the U.S. struggles to curb the deadly COVID-19 disease, the virus hasn’t seen a resurgence in the eurozone, influencing how money managers see their respective paths of recovery. Barclays, BlackRock and other banks are now advising investors to lift their holdings of European equities, sometimes at the expense of their...

While China‘s military muscle-flexing and advancements — including its rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and a recent test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile — have made global headlines in recent months, a White House summary of Monday night’s call made no mention of a specific discussion on such matters between Mr. Biden and...
__label__5 Sweden's Coronavirus ResponseThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSWhile the rest of the developed world lives under lockdown, Sweden has allowed public spaces such as schools, gyms, cafes, bars and restaurants to remain open. However, public gatherings of 50 people or more have been banned. While no compulsory lockdown is in place, the Swedish government is trusting Swedes to follow social distancing guidelines on their own.While critics claim that the Swedish strategy is intentionally trying to develop "herd immunity"--the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune--state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has denied that this is the intent.Swedish officials expect a 4% decline in GDP in 2020, matching the IMF's prediction of a 3% decline globally. This, however, falls well below Europe's predicted 7.5% decline, although those losses are led by Italy and Spain. 36,800 Swedes lost their jobs in March, matching a 0.1% increase in unemployment across the EU.As of May 4th, Sweden had 265 deaths per million people--lower than Belgium (676), Spain (540), Italy (477), the UK (419), France (381), and the Netherlands (295), but higher than the US (204), China (3), and Iran (73), as well as its neighbors in Ireland (263) Denmark (83), Norway (38), Finland (41), Germany (79), and Poland (17). Sweden's trend in daily cases (23 per million on May 4th) appears similar to other European trends.

__label__1 GOP Lawmakers Concerned Biden Removed Sanctions To Appease IranA group of 33 Republican lawmakers launched an investigation on Thursday into the Biden administration’s decision to remove sanctions earlier this month on entities tied to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program. Congressional Republicans suspect the Biden Treasury Department’s decision is part of a package of concessions meant to entice Iran into resuming negotiations aimed at securing a return to the nuclear deal—though senior U.S. officials dispute this claim, saying that the sanctions were removed following an internal legal review. Diplomatic talks with Iran have stalled since the regime inaugurated a new...

Conservative media figures painted Black activists as violent terrorists endangering the lives of its viewers and civilization itself, while outlets like Fox News celebrated white, right-wing vigilantes as heroes, the true victims of law enforcement.  Fox fed its audience wildly inaccurate caricatures of protests in cities across the country, suggested that urban areas were being consumed by violence, and encouraged Trump to...
__label__1 Biden Admits to Supreme Court: The ‘Forever War’ Is Not Over, After AllOPINIONTo the extent President Biden’s pull-out from Afghanistan was not criminally negligent, it was pervasively mendacious. There was the president’s lamebrained targeting of September 11 as the withdrawal deadline — a strategic and propaganda boon for the Taliban. There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan...

Donald Trump Jr. shared the claim, along with figures like Sean Hannity and Diamond and Silk.  Right-wing outlets such as Newsmax, the Daily Caller, TrendingPolitics, the Post Millennial, and the New York Post further elevated the claim. While Trump Jr.’s claim that Harris herself hired the kids is incorrect, the claim that they are child actors is true. Accusations of the use of actors in political events is a regular occurrence in...
__label__3 Child tax credit payments go out July 15. Here's what you need to knowThe Internal Revenue Service is set to begin sending the expanded child tax credit payments on July 15 to tens of millions of families, providing them with extra funds each month through the end of 2021 along with a tax break next year. The payments were approved as part of the Democrats' $1.9 trillion stimulus package that President Joe Biden signed into law in March. The infusions may offer the greatest benefit to low-income families, cutting child poverty nearly in half -- but the extra cash will also go to better-off American families. Here are four things you need to...
__label__2 Intel Agencies Warned of Afghan Collapse as Biden Publicly Downplayed PossibilityU.S. intelligence agencies warned of the collapse of the Afghan military and government at the hands of a resurgent Taliban over the summer, as President Biden publicly downplayed the possibility of a government rout. While Biden assured Americans on July 8 that the Afghan regime’s disintegration was far from inevitable, quieting fears of a “Saigon-like” foreign policy fiasco, previous intelligence reports indicated that Afghan security forces as well as the seat of government in Kabul were weakening and could falter, current and former American government officials told the New York Times.
__label__5 Donald Trump's Claim U.S. Left $85 Billion of Equipment With TalibanFACT CHECKFormer President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and pointed towards the cost of equipment left behind in the hands of the Taliban. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on October 7, Trump criticized President Joe Biden's handling of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. At one point, Trump said: "We left $85 billion worth of equipment in the hands of the Taliban." Trump has made this claim previously, and in a statement on August 30 said: "Never in history has a withdrawal from war been handled so badly or incompetently as...
__label__3 How American parents became obsessed with genderOPINIONWhen I was pregnant with my first child, I agonized over my decision to find out the sex. I knew that anatomy does not indicate gender identity, but I was also impatient, ready for some forecast, however unreliable, of what the future might hold for me as a mother. Having grown up as a girl in America, I knew what gendered wars I might be up against if I were to have a daughter. I wanted to prepare myself for the fight. At my second-trimester ultrasound, I decided to find...
__label__1 Biden Must Answer For The Disaster In KabulANALYSISNo one is debating the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The question is, why did the withdrawal devolve into a horrifying disaster? I left for a weekend mountain-climbing trip early this past Saturday, blissfully out of cell range and cut off from the outside world for nearly two full days. That Friday evening before I left, there were reports that the security situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating, that the Taliban had taken control of three major cities in the western and southern parts of the country and were quickly...
__label__5 Covid-19 vaccines: Has China made more than other countries combined?FACT CHECKChina says it has provided more than half of all the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured globally. We've looked into this and found that the answer isn't as straightforward as you might think. A video posted on social media by the Chinese Communist Party's youth league claims that over half the world's vaccines have come from China. It was posted on Weibo - the Chinese version of Twitter - at the end of September, just as the number of Covid vaccines administered globally had passed six billion (according to the website Our World...
__label__3 Immigrants can help with the U.S. ‘baby bust’OPINIONThe June 26 editorial “A quickening U.S. baby bust” highlighted the daunting economic challenges posed by the nation’s plummeting birthrates. Indeed, lagging births and stagnant immigration growth will ultimately result in fewer workers and weaken the safety net that supports an increasingly aging population of elderly Americans. Before the coronavirus pandemic, immigrant workers were adding approximately $2 trillion annually to the U.S. economy, comparable to President Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and with considerably greater economic impact than President Donald Trump’s tax cuts. Importantly, without substantial immigration growth, the nation’s post-pandemic workforce will not...
__label__2 Afghanistan Illustrates Biden’s Disastrous Foreign-Policy InstinctsOPINIONThe unfolding disaster in Afghanistan is a bipartisan, trans-administrational failure. It is a humiliation. Whatever your position is on the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the fact is that after 20 years, after thousands of lives and hundreds of billions spent on the military, police, training, infrastructure and education, the country is likely to fall to radicals in less than 20 days. As of this writing, the Taliban are routing Afghan troops with seeming ease, taking Kandahar, Herat, and closing in on Kabul. The United States has been forced to send 3,000...
__label__4 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...
__label__3 Women Are Having Fewer Babies Because They Have More ChoicesOPINIONAmerican women are having fewer children and having them later than ever before — a demographic shift being met with significant consternation from the left and right alike.For conservatives, the fact that more women are putting off parenthood or forgoing it entirely is evidence of a dangerous decline in traditional family values. In this framing, women have been manipulated into putting their educational and professional aspirations ahead of motherhood, contributing to a broader cultural breakdown.
__label__1 US military to help evacuate Americans from embassy in Kabul: officialsThe U.S. military will help evacuate Americans from the embassy in Kabul as the security situation deteriorates across Afghanistan, two officials confirmed Thursday to Fox News. The plans to evacuate the Americans were briefed to President Biden earlier Thursday in order to get his approval, one official added. The military will evacuate "thousands" of American citizens and Afghan interpreters from Kabul.  "Things are moving," one official said. A senior White House official told Fox News that President Biden held a meeting about the move Wednesday night, tasking his principals and then meeting with them again Thursday morning. The defense secretary...
__label__4 Trump’s Final NumbersFACT CHECKThe statistics for the entirety of Donald Trump’s time in office are nearly all compiled. As we did for his predecessor four years ago, we present a final look at the numbers. The economy lost 2.9 million jobs. The unemployment rate increased by 1.6 percentage points to 6.3%. Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Average weekly earnings for all workers were up 8.7% after inflation. After-tax corporate profits went up, and the stock market set new records. The S&P 500 index rose 67.8%. The international trade deficit Trump promised to reduce...
__label__3 Father's Day weekend isn't automatically a time to celebrate. Dads must earn their holiday.OPINIONFor adult children who have traumatic relationships with their parents, holidays like Mother's Day and Father's Day are complicated at best and at worst emotional scourges. Many survivors of childhood dysfunction are at a loss for how to celebrate these pseudo-traditions in a way that remains authentic to themselves and their healing. Therapists’ offices and survivor-focused social media groups are replete with people exchanging ideas for how to survive family-oriented holidays in the face of problematic or abusive parental behavior. As the unwitting recipient of a dysfunctional childhood, I participate in online recovery groups...
__label__1 Israeli defense minister says his country is ready to strike IranA top Israeli official said his country is ready to strike Iran in retaliation for a recent attack on an oil tanker belonging to an Israeli firm. Defense Minister Benny Gantz replied, "Yes," when asked by the Israeli news site Ynet News on Thursday whether the Israeli Defense Forces was ready to take military action against Iran. "Iran seeks to pose a multi-front challenge to Israel, as such is building up its forces in Lebanon and Gaza, deploying militias in Syria and Iraq, and maintaining its supporters in Yemen. Iran is a global...
__label__4 Ivermectin: How false science created a Covid 'miracle' drugANALYSISIvermectin has been called a Covid "miracle" drug, championed by vaccine opponents, and recommended by health authorities in some countries. But the BBC can reveal there are serious errors in a number of key studies that the drug's promoters rely on. For some years ivermectin has been a vital anti-parasitic medicine used to treat humans and animals. But during the pandemic there has been a clamour from some proponents for using the drug for something else - to fight Covid and prevent deaths. The health authorities in the US, UK...
__label__3 The Real Reason Behind the Misinformation Epidemic in Online Moms’ GroupsANALYSISThe rollout of children’s COVID vaccines has begun: On Monday, the FDA approved the Pfizer shot for 12- to 15-year-olds. That’s just the beginning—last week, the New York Times reported that children as young as 2 could be eligible as soon as September. The mass vaccination of children could herald the end of the most catastrophic social costs from the pandemic in the United States: Schools and day care facilities will be able to resume normal operations, which means parents will no longer have to perform the nearly impossible act...
__label__1 FBI Raid of James O'Keefe's House Is a Blow to Press FreedomOPINIONThe FBI searched the home of James O'Keefe—a conservative activist who films undercover videos for his organization, Project Veritas—on Saturday, reportedly because law enforcement wants to know how O'Keefe came to possess a diary allegedly stolen from Ashley Biden, President Joe Biden's daughter. The FBI also searched the homes of two O'Keefe associates. There's still much more to learn about the reasons for the search, but what we do know is troubling and potentially objectionable on the grounds of press freedom. O'Keefe has claimed that he received the diary from...
__label__5 Does California Have Lowest COVID Case Rate of Any State?FACT CHECKCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has touted COVID case rate numbers in his state. Newsom tweeted that "California continues to lead the nation with the lowest COVID case rate" on October 4. He also noted the state's CDC transmission category, alongside a color map of the United States which was said to detail community transmission in states. On the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, there is a COVID data tracker which details levels of community transmission across the United States. As of October 5, California was noted to have 70.6 new cases...
__label__3 The problem is workANALYSISPandemic parenting is impossible. American work culture is a big reason why. Erica, an Indiana mom, was working part time last spring as a computer scientist. At the same time, she was taking care of her first-grader, preschooler, and toddler at home, with schools and day care centers in the area shuttered due to the pandemic. During one of her work shifts, she was nursing her toddler while trying to read at her desk, “and he swung his leg, and it somehow landed in my tea, and it kicked the...
__label__1 Why Are the Media Treating 'Let's Go Brandon' Like Criminal Hate Speech?ANALYSISLast month, NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his victory in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Sparks 300 race when fans started chanting "fuck Joe Biden." But that's not what Stavast heard. And so the "let's go Brandon" chant—a less vulgar way of signaling one's opposition to the current president—was born. Fans say it at sports gatherings. Conservatives tweet it at each other. Even Republican politicians are getting in on it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) has been known to say it. So what? Well, even though it...
__label__4 Doctors grow frustrated over COVID-19 denial, misinformationThe COVID-19 patient’s health was deteriorating quickly at a Michigan hospital, but he was having none of the doctor’s diagnosis. Despite dangerously low oxygen levels, the unvaccinated man didn’t think he was that sick and got so irate over a hospital policy forbidding his wife from being at his bedside that he threatened to walk out of the building. Dr. Matthew Trunsky didn’t hold back in his response: “You are welcome to leave, but you will be dead before you get to your car,’” he said. Such exchanges have become...
__label__3 The COVID-19 Relief Bill Could Be A Huge Turning Point For Child Care In The U.S.Because of coronavirus-related restrictions, the kids don’t roller skate anymore at the Funtime Preschool in Clinton, Mississippi. But that’s hardly the only change, said Lesia Daniel Hollingshead, who opened an after-school program out of her father’s skating rink more than 20 years ago and has since expanded it into a full-time child care center. The pandemic upended her entire operation. “It’s completely different,” she said. Enrollment is half of what it was last year and revenue is down 40%. Yet costs have tripled, she said. Operating a child care center...
__label__2 Hong Kong Passes Film Censorship LawThe legislature of Hong Kong passed a new law allowing censorship of certain films in the most recent move to infringe upon the liberties of people in the region.  As reported by the BBC:  The film censorship law was approved in the opposition-free Legislative Council. It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__4 Trusting science leaves people vulnerable to believing pseudoscience, new research findsPeople who trust science are more likely to be duped into believing and disseminating pseudoscience, finds a new paper in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. Pseudoscience is false information that references science broadly or scientific terms, research or phenomena. Across four experiments, researchers asked U.S. adults to read news articles written for the study that intentionally made false claims about two topics: a fictional virus created as a bioweapon or the health effects of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. The experiments reveal that study participants who indicated they had higher levels...
__label__3 Mitt Romney Has a Plan, and Joe Biden Should Borrow From ItOPINIONThe United States allows more than 10 million American children to live in poverty, bereft of resources and opportunity. The wealthiest nation on earth does less than almost every other developed nation to help children who grow up in low-income families. These millions of individual tragedies are particularly heartbreaking because there is an obvious solution that has proved its value in other developed nations. The corrective for child poverty is for the government to give money to people who have children. The Biden administration is working with congressional Democrats on...
__label__2 MIT Canceled a Professor's Guest Lecture Because He Opposes Race-Based AdmissionsANALYSISDorian Abbot is a geophysicist at the University of Chicago. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...
__label__5 She was an intelligence analyst at the CIA. Now she writes about the dangers of ‘fake news.’ANALYSISAs an intelligence analyst at the CIA, Cindy Otis was trained to assess how our country’s foreign adversaries deploy divisive rumors, destructive conspiracy theories and other kinds of disinformation against us. Several months after the 2016 presidential election — which saw both the concerted Russian campaign to undermine trust in democracy and a surge in domestically created false content — she decided to leave the agency and deploy her skills on a different front. The analytic skills she had acquired, she reasoned, could be used to help the public learn how to responsibly assess what they’re...
__label__3 Political divisions are increasingly stronger than family bondsDonald Trump is out of office. His impeachment is over. And he’s been blocked by social media platforms. But even in his relative silence, he’s still a wedge issue between some family members — perhaps even more so given the events of his final weeks in office. The hazard seems even greater if your job is to engage in politics. Some relatives of Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R.-Ill.) wrote a letter to him after he voted to impeach Trump that illustrates this, in scathing terms. The note, which the New York...
__label__1 Has Donald Trump found a way around his bans on Facebook, Twitter?Former President Donald Trump has figured out a way to circumvent his current bans on the world’s biggest social media sites including Twitter and Facebook, announcing Wednesday that he’ll launch his own social media site, Truth Social, in a test version next month. In a press release, Trump announced a company he operates, Trump Media & Technology Group, will partner with Digital World Acquisition Corp. to launch the new platform, which will be available initially on an invite-only basis before rolling out nationally in the first quarter of 2022, according to...
__label__5 Coalition calls on Biden to form disinformation task forceA coalition of groups is calling on President Biden to create a task force that can explore ways to crack down on deliberate disinformation campaigns in ways that don't unduly limit free expression. Why it matters: The spread of false information around elections, health, climate and other pivotal issues has had a huge impact on American institutions, but civil liberties groups say it is critical to find solutions that maintain free speech protections. "The prevalence of deceptions, propaganda, and conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election, COVID-19, and the recent...

__label__2 Listen to Yale Law School Administrators Tell a Student His Affiliation With the Federalist Society Is ‘Triggering’ for ClassmatesThe following audio comes from meetings between a student at Yale Law School and two administrators: associate dean Ellen Cosgrove and diversity director Yaseen Eldik. On Sept. 16, the student was told that his membership in the "oppressive" Federalist Society had "triggered" his peers. On Sept. 17, he was reminded that "there’s a bar you have to take." The meetings came in response to an email the student had sent inviting classmates to a happy hour at his "trap house," which elicited allegations that he was planning a blackface party.

__label__3 ‘I Miss My Mom’: Children Of QAnon Believers Are Desperately Trying To Deradicalize Their Own ParentsANALYSISShortly before Joe Biden was inaugurated, Sam’s mother began stocking up on food in a panic. He didn’t know why, but he knew it probably had something to do with QAnon. The 19-year-old started to notice changes in his mother’s behavior around the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. She had always been a nervous woman: She stopped flying after 9/11 and had hovered closely to Sam and his two younger siblings for their entire lives. But during the COVID-19 crisis, his mom’s paranoia spiraled from quirky to deranged. It has...

St. Albans, whose alumni include vice presidents and two current U.S. senators, is considering a crackdown on "harmful" speech that prioritizes the impact of the speech rather than the intent of the speaker. "It is the impact of hate speech, rather than the intent of those perpetrating it, that is...
__label__5 Twitter Says Calling Boulder Shooter a 'White Christian Terrorist' Is OKA tweet describing Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, the suspected gunman in Monday's Colorado supermarket shooting, as a "white Christian terrorist" does not violate the social network's misinformation policies, Twitter told Newsweek.Many Twitter users assumed the shooter was white before his name was released by police in Boulder, Colorado. Several pointed to the massacre as another example of racial injustice and white supremacy in the United States, coming a few days after a white man killed six Asian women in an Atlanta shooting spree.

__label__2 Supreme Court rejects First Amendment lawsuit involving Trump election lawyerThe Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a case involving a prominent Trump legal adviser who was banned from a speaking event due to his conservative views. The Western Justice Center in Pasadena, California, canceled an event by the Pasadena Republican Club on April 20, 2017, because attorney John Eastman was a speaker. Mr. Eastman had advised former President Trump’s legal team on election challenges. The GOP group previously had hosted evening events at the building. But the Western Justice Center, which had authority over city-owned property, banned the group...
__label__4 Why do Americans share so much fake news? One big reason is they aren’t paying attention, new research suggestsMany Americans share fake news on social media because they’re simply not paying attention to whether the content is accurate — not necessarily because they can’t tell real from made-up news, a new study in Nature suggests. Lack of attention was the driving factor behind 51.2% of misinformation sharing among social media users who participated in an experiment conducted by a group of researchers from MIT, the University of Regina in Canada, University of Exeter Business School in the United Kingdom and Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in...
__label__3 Sessions and top aides pushed for separating migrant families despite warnings, report findsFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his aides were the "driving force" behind the separation of thousands of migrant families in 2017 and 2018, pushing for the policy's implementation even as federal prosecutors raised concerns about the young age of some of the children, according to a report released by the Justice Department's internal watchdog. A 93-page report published on Thursday by the Justice Department's Inspector General found that Sessions and top aides, including his counselor Gene Hamilton, failed to coordinate with U.S. prosecutors, the U.S. Marshals Service and shelters...

Haugen, who was employed as a product manager on Facebook’s Civic Misinformation team, leaked internal documents published by The Wall Street Journal last month detailing Facebook’s business practices. The leaked documents showed that Facebook’s algorithms amplified incendiary and divisive content, as well as misleading information related to the COVID-19 vaccine. Haugen called to crack down on the amplification of “hateful” speech and...
__label__4 The presumed influence of election misinformation on others reduces our own satisfaction with democracyANALYSISPervasive political misinformation threatens the integrity of American electoral democracy but not in the manner most commonly examined. We argue the presumed influence of misinformation (PIM) may be just as pernicious, and widespread, as any direct influence that political misinformation may have on voters. Our online survey of 2,474 respondents in the United States shows that greater attention to political news heightens PIM on others as opposed to oneself, especially among Democrats and Independents. In turn, PIM on others reduces satisfaction with American electoral democracy, eroding the “virtuous circle” between...
__label__3 A Shift in American Family Values Is Fueling EstrangementOPINIONSometimes my work feels more like ministry than therapy. As a psychologist specializing in family estrangement, my days are spent sitting with parents who are struggling with profound feelings of grief and uncertainty. “If I get sick during the pandemic, will my son break his four years of silence and contact me? Or will I just die alone?” “How am I supposed to live with this kind of pain if I never see my daughter again?” “My grandchildren and I were so close and this estrangement has nothing to do...
__label__1 Facebook Whistleblower Claims Profit Was Prioritized Over Clamping Down on Hate SpeechA Facebook whistleblower, who is due to testify before Congress on Tuesday, has accused the Big Tech company of repeatedly putting profit before doing “what was good for the public,” including clamping down on hate speech. Frances Haugen, who told CBS’s “60 Minutes” program that she was recruited by Facebook as a product manager on the civic misinformation team in 2019, said she and her attorneys have filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. During her appearance on the television program on Sunday, Haugen revealed that she was...
__label__5 Conspiracy theories influence our behavior -- even if we do not believe in themANALYSISNot least because of the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories are more topical than ever. They are reported and discussed in almost all media and communication channels. But what influence do they have on our behavior? Scientists led by behavioral economist Loukas Balafoutas investigated this question in a recently published study. The result: We don't need to believe in conspiracy theories for them to have an impact on us. Merely being confronted with them suffices.
__label__3 Child-safety laws may reduce the birth rateIn the early 1970s American women gave birth, on average, to 2.12 children each. By 2018 that figure had fallen to 1.73. Many alterations in people’s lives have been invoked to help explain this change, including the facts that women now are better educated, more likely to have jobs or run businesses, and have better access to contraception than their antecedents of five decades ago. Also, demand for children to work as extra pairs of hands on family farms has dropped. None of these explanations, though, overlaps neatly with birth-rate...

As journalists, many of us focused on the headline—Twitter bans Trump. We failed to understand that our obsession with those same tweets, or “how they...

__label__2 The ACLU’s RBG Tweet Shows Once Again That It Has Abandoned Free SpeechOPINIONThis tweet is doing the rounds: @ACLU: With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, we lost a champion for abortion and gender equality. And on the anniversary of her death, the fight to protect abortion access is more urgent than ever. Of course, Ginsberg didn’t say this. Instead, she said: The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When the government controls that decision for her, she is being treated...
__label__5 How to Spot a Deepfake Without Even Watching the VideoDeepfakes are videos that glue one person’s face onto another’s body, making the former look like they’re saying or doing something that they never actually did—even if it’s something as harmless as Tom Cruise talking to the camera and hitting a golf ball. They’re hard to spot just from watching the video, but here’s the good news: you don’t actually have to watch the video to know you’ve encountered a deepfake. The Tom Cruise deepfakes (a few brief videos posted to TikTok on an account called @deeptomcruise) were convincing because...
__label__3 Colorado Voters Could Be First To Pass Paid Family Leave by Ballot MeasureFOR SIX YEARS, the Colorado legislature has tried — and failed — to pass paid family leave. On November 3, Colorado residents themselves will get the opportunity to vote directly for the creation of a leave program, thanks to the ballot measure Proposition 118. If it passes, the ballot measure will create a social insurance program that will provide all state residents 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new baby, recover from a serious illness or injury, care for a family member with a serious health condition,...
__label__2 The Antisocial NetworkOPINIONSome years ago, in a typical attempt to make his point in the most cringe-inducing manner possible, Barack Obama defended the American immigration system on the grounds that, as he put it, “Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.” I’m not actually going to suggest that we deport Mike Krieger, the Brazilian immigrant in question who co-founded Instagram with a friend at Stanford University. (Though if, instead of a billionaire who sold a technology company that allows Kim Kardashian to sell...
__label__5 How memes became a major vehicle for misinformationWall Street's populist uprising, the Capitol siege and a strong U.S. anti-vaccination movement show the power of memes in spreading misinformation and influencing communities online. Why it matters: For years, there's been growing concern that deepfakes (doctored pictures and videos) would become truth's greatest threat. Instead, memes have proven to be a more effective tool in spreading misinformation because they're easier to produce and harder to moderate using artificial intelligence. "When we talk abut deepfakes, there are already companies and technologies that can help you understand their origin," says Shane...
__label__3 3 ways to get kids to tune in and pay attention when schools go virtualANALYSISWhen nearly all U.S. brick-and-mortar schools suddenly closed in March 2020 and went online, large numbers of students simply didn’t log into class. Even if they did show up, many more weren’t paying much attention or doing their schoolwork. As a new school year gets underway, is there anything that teachers and families can do to curb these problems with remote learning due to COVID-19? Having spent our careers doing research on student motivation and learning with technology, we recommend these three strategies. 1. Go out of your way to...
__label__2 New York Governor Asks Facebook to Censor Pro-Life ‘Misinformation’ About AbortionNew York’s brand new governor wants Facebook to censor pro-life “misinformation” about abortion. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, sent a letter Monday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting that the social media giant increase efforts to censor pro-life “misinformation” in light of Texas’ new law banning abortions after babies’ heartbeats can be detected. Hochul, who took office in late August after former Gov.

It Led 1 Virginia Pastor To QuitJared Stacy is still processing his decision to leave Spotswood Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va., last year. Until November, he was ministering to young parishioners in their 20s and 30s. But in the four years since he had joined the church as a pastor, Stacy had found himself increasingly up against an invisible, powerful force taking hold of members of his congregation: conspiracy theories, disinformation and lies. Stacy has seen the real consequences of these lies build up over the years; he says it has tainted the name of his...
__label__3 The Anti-Abortion-Rights Movement Prepares to Build a Post-Roe WorldANALYSISIn most circles, abortion does not make for polite dinner-table conversation, especially if you happen to be running a billion-dollar global franchise. So for years, Cheryl Bachelder kept quiet. She stood out professionally as the rare female CEO of a major corporation, overseeing Popeyes while chasing after three daughters and, eventually, four grandsons. As a Christian, she watched with distaste as her fellow business leaders indulged the decadence and money-fueled antics of the 1980s and ’90s, posing on magazine covers with jets and girls. She and her husband donated to...
__label__2 WORST Censorship in August: 5 Ways Big Tech Silenced Online DiscussionOPINIONBig Tech corporations have increasingly censored more prominent politicians and celebrities as the woke executives in charge seemingly try to appease their radical Silicon Valley employees and the left. Online platforms targeted many well-known personalities last month and restricted their access to reach broader audiences with their ideas. No one appeared safe. YouTube reportedly suspended Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) for calling out a prior case of the platform’s censorship. Paul discussed masking and the federal government’s COVID-19 response with Newsmax in a previous video that YouTube reportedly removed. The senator created another video protesting...
__label__5 Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking experiment reveals problemsANALYSISOn Feb. 5, Twitter flagged a post from controversial YouTuber Tim Pool that said the 2020 U.S. presidential election was rigged. The platform noted that the claim was disputed and turned off engagement “due to a risk of violence.” But, on Birdwatch, the social media platform’s experiment in crowdsourced fact-checking, users overwhelmingly said the tweet was not misleading, according to a Feb. 14 analysis of Twitter data. And most Birdwatch users indicated in the tool that they found these notes that supported debunked claims helpful and informative. “According to the...
__label__3 Americans Aren’t Making Babies, and That’s Bad for the EconomyPandas and white rhinos aren’t the only creatures that are unsuccessful at mating in captivity. The folk wisdom that humans will copulate when left with nothing else to do—dubbed the blackout babies theory—surfaces regularly in the immediate aftermath of disasters, but the baby boom never materializes.The Covid-19 pandemic spawned predictions that stay-at-home orders would eventually deliver a baby bump. Yet far from having more children than usual, Americans are expecting fewer.
__label__1 Amid Big Tech fight, web hosting company gives conservatives a cancel-proof alternativeAs conservatives look to fight back against what they see as an ideologically driven censorship push by Big Tech, one company is looking to make the building blocks of the Internet cancel-proof – giving conservatives more solid footing online. RightForge is an internet infrastructure company providing server space and web hosting, with what it describes as an ideological commitment to free speech, and it is offering a platform that caters to conservative outlets, campaigns and others who fear they could be canceled by Big Tech. "We are absolutely ideological," CEO Martin Avila told Fox...
__label__5 How countries amplify COVID disinformationChina, Russia and Iran — drawing on one another’s online disinformation — amplified false theories that the COVID-19 virus originated in a U.S. bioweapons lab or was designed by Washington to weaken their countries, according to a nine-month investigation by AP and the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab. Why it matters: Through a series of overlapping, if slapdash, efforts, America's global adversaries benefited from mutually reinforcing counter-narratives propagated online that aimed to falsely place responsibility for the pandemic on the U.S. and often to sow doubt on its actual origin within China....
__label__3 Why a generation is choosing to be child-freeWhen I think that it won’t hurt too much, I imagine the children I will not have. Would they be more like me or my partner? Would they have inherited my thatch of hair, our terrible eyesight? Mostly, a child is so abstract to me, living with high rent, student debt, no property and no room, that the absence barely registers. But sometimes I suddenly want a daughter with the same staggering intensity my father felt when he first cradled my tiny body in his big hands. I want to...
__label__2 In Latest Election Meddling, Twitter Suspends J.D. Vance’s Campaign Press Account With ‘No Warning’In the Big Tech giant’s latest attempt at election meddling, Twitter suspended Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance’s campaign press account on Tuesday without any warning or reason. “Why did ⁦@Twitter/@jack suspend my campaign’s press account?” the “Hillbilly Elegy” author tweeted. Vance tweeted that the suspension of the @JDVancePress account, which has 69 followers and is following 189 others, came with “no warning” and did not indicate how long the suspension is expected to last. “No explanation of what rules I allegedly broke. But this is what happens when we allow...
__label__4 Anatomy of a conspiracy: With COVID, China took leading roleThe rumors began almost as soon as the disease itself. Claims that a foreign adversary had unleashed a bioweapon emerged at the fringes of Chinese social media the same day China first reported the outbreak of a mysterious virus. “Watch out for Americans!” a Weibo user wrote on Dec. 31, 2019. Today, a year after the World Health Organization warned of an epidemic of COVID-19 misinformation, that conspiracy theory lives on, pushed by Chinese officials eager to cast doubt on the origins of a pandemic that has claimed more than...

Fox News identified the teacher as Kristin Pitzen of Newport-Mesa Unified School District in Orange County. In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...

Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, in a video posted on YouTube of a meeting with Hillsdale County Republican Party officials, said of the Capitol insurrection in which five people died: "It was all staged." About half an hour into the video Shirkey can also be heard asking, "Why wasn't there more security there?" He accused Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of...

"The account you referenced has been permanently suspended for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation rules," a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News in response to an inquiry Saturday night. On his Substack page, Berenson subsequently posted a brief message, just over 152 characters, titled, "Goodbye Twitter." "This was the tweet that did it," he wrote, above a screenshot of his account before it was taken down. "Entirely accurate. I can’t wait to hear what a jury will...
__label__4 New research shows how journalists are responding and adapting to “fake news” rhetoric“Fake news” is an unfortunate phrase. It is so casually invoked and widely deployed as to be almost devoid of meaning. And, most infamously, it has been weaponized by politicians (one former president in particular) as both a ready tool to dismiss inconvenient truths in the moment and also, more perniciously, to cast doubt on the legitimacy of journalism as a whole. Yet, “fake news” captures for many people a defining set of features about our information environment: from declining trust in news media to concerns about the seemingly supercharged...
__label__3 Long-Secret FBI Report Reveals New Connections Between 9/11 Hijackers and Saudi Religious Officials in U.S.A long-suppressed FBI report on Saudi Arabia’s connections to the 9/11 plot has revealed that Saudi religious officials stationed in the United States had more significant connections to two of the hijackers than has been previously known. The 2016 report was released late Saturday night under an executive order from President Joe Biden, who promised to make it public no later than the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks that killed 2,977 people and injured more than 6,000 others. The 16-page document was a final inventory of circumstantial evidence and leads...
__label__2 Since Platform-by-Platform Censorship Doesn't Work, These Researchers Think, the Government Should Help 'Halt the Spread of Misinformation'ANALYSISBefore Twitter banned then–President Donald Trump in response to the January 6 Capitol riot, the platform tried to police his false claims about election fraud by attaching warning labels or blocking engagement with them. A new study suggests those efforts were ineffective at preventing the spread of Trump's claims and may even have backfired by drawing additional attention to messages that Twitter deemed problematic. Those findings highlight the limits of content moderation policies aimed at controlling misinformation and, more generally, the futility of responding to lies by trying to suppress them. But the researchers...
__label__4 After a ‘post truth’ presidency, can America make facts real again?ANALYSISAcommon theme in U.S. inaugural addresses is for the newly sworn-in president to identify what he sees as the country’s biggest problem. For Ronald Reagan, it was government overreach. For Barack Obama, it was “our collective failure to make hard choices.” For Franklin Roosevelt, it was fear itself. For Joe Biden, it was a breakdown of national cohesion, common purpose, and reality’s most fundamental distinction. “There is truth, and there are lies,” said President Biden. “And each of us has a duty and responsibility ... to defend the truth and...
__label__3 Prosecutors Have Had Six Months To Go After The Capitol Mob. Here’s What They Have So Far.Tuesday marked six months since thousands of Donald Trump supporters toppled and streamed past police barriers onto the grounds of the US Capitol, with hundreds making their way inside the building as lawmakers, staffers, and journalists scrambled to take shelter. The investigation shows no signs of ending any time soon. New arrests have been unsealed in federal court every week since the riots. The FBI continues to solicit tips from the public to identify hundreds of suspects photographed and recorded on video at the scene. And a handful of plea...

__label__4 Journalist identities hijacked to spread fake newsBad actors are hijacking journalist names, photos and bylines to help give credibility to fake storylines or hoaxes on the internet. Why it matters: Even when platforms try to police this type of content, memes and fake stories often still circulate indefinitely, making it hard for victims to fully recover from the hoax. Driving the news: Joe Gould, a Congress and Industry reporter for Defense News, tells Axios about how his identity was hacked to fuel a right-wing meme conspiracy that the incoming Defense Secretary planned to outsource U.S. defense...
__label__3 Attorney General Merrick Garland unveils plan to combat domestic terrorismAttorney General Merrick Garland is considering whether to recommend a new criminal statute to prosecute domestic terrorists, among other tactics he is pledging to use to combat the growing threat of domestic extremist violence. This year, the FBI has seen an increase in the number of open domestic terrorism cases: racially and ethnically motivated attacks and those stemming from militias are the two most lethal drivers. In an address at the Justice Department Tuesday, Garland compared the threat to those posed by foreign violent actors.  "We will never take our...
__label__2 Facebook Oversight Board Member Says Fact-Checking Outside JurisdictionA member of Facebook's independent oversight board said this week that the company's third-party fact-checking program is outside the panel's jurisdiction, which "makes a lot of people quite nervous," Politico reports. Michael McConnell, a former federal judge who now sits on the oversight board, said during the Technology Policy Institute's Aspen Forum on Monday that Facebook's fact-checking operation is "something that we don't review, and yet this is something if you ask people what they think is a problem at Facebook, that's on a lot of people's lists."

__label__4 Newsmax anchor walks away from Mike Lindell interview after he won't drop fraud claimsA Newsmax host on Tuesday walked off camera in the middle of an interview with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell after the businessman and vocal supporter of former President Trump refused to stop voicing unsupported claims of fraud in the 2020 election.  Anchor Bob Sellers, along with fellow host Heather Childers, attempted to interview Lindell on conservative complaints of “cancel culture” after Twitter permanently suspended his account last week over his continued efforts to advance allegations that the vote was rigged in favor of President Biden.  Twitter on Monday...
__label__3 Supreme Court to hear case on FBI surveillance of Muslim Americans following 9/11The Supreme Court announced it will decide whether a lawsuit filed by three Muslim Americans who said the FBI unconstitutionally targeted them for surveillance because of their religion can proceed over the government’s objections. Five years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the FBI paid an informant to pose as a convert to Islam and gather information as part of a counterterrorism investigation in Southern California, according to court records. The plaintiffs alleged the surveillance violated the Constitution because, they said, it was based solely on their religion. The government sought to dismiss the...
__label__2 High School Students Need A Lesson On Free SpeechOPINIONAs high schools prepare to reopen and in-person teaching resumes, students will face many unknowns. One question that must be answered this fall is whether the cancel culture that has plagued the nation will continue in our education institutions. Sadly, new data suggest that the strong impulse to silence those who might be offensive to some will continue. High school communities should push back against current tendencies, however, and demand students have the chance to confront challenging ideas and experience the discomfort that is at the core of the educational...

Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) on Friday reintroduced legislation intended to cut down on foreign disinformation and propaganda spread on social media, in particular following a spike in the content after the presidential election and during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Foreign Agent Disclaimer Enhancement, or FADE, Act would attempt to address foreign disinformation by requiring the inclusion of disclaimers on political content on social media in the U.S. if they are funded by a foreign agent, with the disclaimers to remain if the post is shared....

__label__1 Silenced!OPINIONAre they still protesting in Cuba? I don't know. The Cuban government has shut off the Cuban people's internet. The big demonstrations began four weeks ago, sparked, curiously, by a rap song. The key lyric is: "Freedom! No more Doctrine!" "Doctrine" refers to the "constant cycle of propaganda" from the government, explains Cuban emigre Alian Collazo in my newest video. Sadly, silly TV reporters in America claimed the protests were about "hunger, pandemic restrictions and the lack of COVID vaccinations," or, according to ABC's George Stephanopoulos, "food and fuel shortages." "Nonsense!"...
__label__5 The enduring allure of conspiraciesThe United States of America was founded on a conspiracy theory. In the lead-up to the War of Independence, revolutionaries argued that a tax on tea or stamps is not just a tax, but the opening gambit in a sinister plot of oppression. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were convinced — based on “a long train of abuses and usurpations” — that the king of Great Britain was conspiring to establish “an absolute Tyranny” over the colonies. “The document itself is a written conspiracy theory,” says Nancy Rosenblum,...
__label__3 Justice Department withdraws FBI subpoena for USA TODAY records ID'ing readersThe FBI has withdrawn a subpoena demanding records from USA TODAY that would identify readers of a February story about a southern Florida shootout that killed two agents and wounded three others. The subpoena, issued as part of an investigation seeking to identify a child sexual exploitation offender, was withdrawn after investigators found the person through other means, according to a notice the Justice Department sent to USA TODAY's attorneys Saturday.  Charles Tobin, who represents Gannett, USA TODAY's parent company, said the Justice Department's decision to withdraw the subpoena should remind the Biden administration of the importance of...
__label__2 At Least We Still Have Free Speech and PressOPINIONAs a long-time observer of American radio, TV and newspapers, I am appalled by claims some people are placing on Facebook that we no longer have a free press. These claims, freely transmitted over the internet, would seem to contradict themselves. One wonders if these people have any understanding of what life was like in a country that really did not have a free press: the Soviet Union prior to Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost (free speech). The Soviet censorship agency, Glavlit, employed 80,000 people. Nothing could be published — even a...
__label__4 Epoch Times revenue soared on Trump conspiraciesThe publisher of The Epoch Times, a stridently pro-Trump publication with a flair for conspiracy theories and links to Chinese dissidents, nearly quadrupled its revenue during the first three years of the administration. Why it matters: The nonprofit Epoch Times Association’s 2019 revenue of $15.5 million, up from $3.9 million in 2016, shows how lucrative news coverage catering to the president's most fervent supporters could be — and will likely remain even after he leaves office. Founded in 2000, The Epoch Times has ties to members of the Falun Gong,...

__label__5 Bad actors are returning to old-school methods of sowing chaosANALYSISAs millions of people around the world were under lockdown this year, social media became a lifeline for many. While researchers and journalists were focused on mis- and disinformation flourishing on the main social media platforms, information disruptors returned to old-school methods of sowing chaos and confusion through leaflets, billboards, emails, SMS, and robocalls. The pandemic became an opportunity for the dissemination of Covid-19 hoaxes and conspiracy theories through mailboxes straight into people’s homes. Leaflets sent out in the UK claimed that the government, the media and National Health Service...

In their study published in the journal PeerJ Computer Science, the researchers found strong correlations between specific language patterns and the propensity to share false information. Users who shared dubious information tended to use the words, “media,” “government,” “truth,” “Israel,” “liberal,” “muslim” and “Islam” in their tweets. Users who shared more reliable information sources tended to use more personal...

Giuliani, the former New York City mayor once celebrated for his leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, has been under federal scrutiny for several years over his ties to Ukraine. The dual searches sent the strongest signal yet that he could eventually face federal charges. Agents searched Giuliani’s home on Madison Avenue...

Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator and former prosecutor who serves on the judiciary committee, is calling on the newly-confirmed attorney general, Merrick Garland, to help facilitate “proper oversight” by the Senate into questions about how thoroughly the FBI investigated Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. The supreme court justice was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford and faced several other...

Viral video from earlier this week showed a brazen man riding a bike through a San Francisco Walgreens store hauling apparently stolen goods as he zipped his way past shoppers, including a security guard who was filming the incident on his cell phone, before...
__label__5 How to reduce the spread of fake news – by doing nothingANALYSISWhen we come across false information on social media, it is only natural to feel the need to call it out or argue with it. But my research suggests this might do more harm than good. It might seem counterintuitive, but the best way to react to fake news – and reduce its impact – may be to do nothing at all. False information on social media is a big problem. A UK parliament committee said online misinformation was a threat to “the very fabric of our democracy”. It can...

Capitol Police Leaders Never Saw the Report.ANALYSISDuring a Senate hearing on Tuesday examining the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, former security and law enforcement officials largely blamed a lack of proper intelligence for being unprepared. But, according to one former security official who testified, the FBI had sent out an intelligence report days before the 6th that detailed the high probability of right-wing violence that could take place on the Capitol. But that report somehow never reached the top officials who had the authority to properly act on it.  During the joint hearing...

Turns out pretty much every left-wing activist in the country. Worse, most of them still...
__label__5 The Peril of Persuasion in the Big Tech AgeOPINIONPersuasion is as old our species. Both democracy and the market economy depend on it. Politicians persuade citizens to vote for them, or to support different policy positions. Businesses persuade consumers to buy their products or services. We all persuade our friends to accept our choice of restaurant, movie, and so on. It’s essential to society; we couldn’t get large groups of people to work together without it. But as with many things, technology is fundamentally changing the nature of persuasion. And society needs to adapt its rules of persuasion...
__label__3 The FBI Wants You To Make These Photos Of Capitol Insurrectionists Go ViralThe search for the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol last month isn’t your typical FBI manhunt. Usually, when the FBI asks the public for help identifying someone photographed committing a federal crime, they’re focused on one person, maybe two. They probably know the general area where the suspect lives and can focus their efforts on that region accordingly. If they want a little more publicity ― say, for a serial bank robber ― they’ll give them a catchy nickname that will generate more headlines, public interest and social media...

Hundreds of miles away in Columbia, S.C., at a mall designated rally point “Rebel,” other Trump supporters gathered to form another caravan to Washington. A similar meetup — dubbed “Minuteman” — was planned for Springfield, Mass.

The percentage — the highest since the organization began recording the trend in 1996 — marks a 10% increase since 2015, the same year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled all states must recognize same-sex marriages. The rise in support stems largely from a majority of Republicans, who for the first time approve of same-sex marriage at 55%, according to Gallup.

__label__2 Is San Francisco the future of America?OPINIONIt’s one thing to read about the decline of San Francisco. It’s another to see it for yourself. I could hardly recognize this once-captivating city of breathtaking views, delectable food and cool jazz. Today it’s occupied by an army of homeless men and women who have turned Baghdad-by-the-bay into Bombay-by-the-bay with some of the dirtiest slums in America. I first visited San Francisco in 1964 as a member of Barry Goldwater’s political team that wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination for the candidate who offered a conservative choice, not a...

__label__5 Biden’s Push For Big Government Solutions Is Popular Now — But It Could BackfireANALYSISJust weeks after the passage of President Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package, he introduced two more sweeping pieces of legislation: first, a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that would not only repair roads and bridges but also reshape the economy, and second, a $1.8 trillion plan for a federal paid-leave program, universal prekindergarten and more. In all, Biden is proposing a nearly $6 trillion infusion in the economy. What’s even more remarkable than the price tag is just how popular these proposals are with the public.

__label__5 The COVID baby bust and the risks of declining birth ratesAt the start of the coronavirus lockdowns, some predicted that all the time Americans spent indoors with little to do would lead to a baby boom. It will be several months before definitive data is available, but evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic will actually lead to a baby bust. The combined influence of stress, economic uncertainty and fewer opportunities for people to meet could lead to as many as 500,000 fewer babies born in the U.S. in 2021, one study found. Any coronavirus baby bust would extend a trend...
__label__3 The FDA Really Did Have to Take This LongANALYSISIf vaccine approval feels maddeningly scrupulous, that’s because the alternative is worse. After months of anticipation, Americans have a fully licensed COVID-19 vaccine. Today, the FDA announced the approval of Pfizer-BioNTech’s shot for people 16 and older—the first complete thumbs-up among the three vaccines available in the U.S. The pervasive mood has been: Finally. Pfizer’s shot was given its emergency use authorization—the vaccine’s training wheels—back in December, and the company submitted its application for full approval in May. While America’s emergency-use vaccination rollout has saved an untold number of lives, many...
__label__2 George Floyd's Brother Uttered the Three Words that Boils the Blood of the Progressive LeftOPINIONThey’re not controversial. It’s common sense. It’s something that everyone can agree with, but it blunts the messaging the progressive Left wants to echo about police and the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s like when the Left gets upset when people say that ‘most cops are good.’ The Left wants to destroy policing, liking it to slave patrols. As former police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison for his part in the killing of George Floyd last year that set off a summer of leftist violence,...
__label__5 Mitt Romney proposes giving American families an extra $3,000 a yearSenator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) unveiled a plan on Thursday that would provide American families with a bigger financial boost than what’s proposed in the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion relief package. But both plans fail to completely cover child-care costs for the average American. Romney released the Family Security Act on Thursday — which the senator plans to propose as an amendment included with the Democrats’ stimulus package — which would provide families up to $3,000 a year in financial support per child ages 6 to 17 and up to $4,200...
__label__3 Vaccine mandates more likely once FDA grants full approvals, health experts sayThe United States could see a wave of Covid-19 vaccine mandates as soon as the Food and Drug Administration grants full approval to one or more of the shots, public health experts predicted. The three vaccines authorized by the FDA for emergency use against the coronavirus have proven safe and effective under that expedited review process and in the real world, and doctors and the nation's top public health officials have said there's no need for anyone to wait to get inoculated. But as the pace of vaccinations lags and concerns about the highly-contagious...

Why it matters: It's one of the most egregious journalistic errors in modern history, and the media's response to its own mistakes has so far been tepid. Outsized coverage of the unvetted document drove a media frenzy at the start of Donald Trump's presidency that helped drive a narrative of collusion between former President Trump and Russia.  It also helped drive an even bigger wedge between former...

Why it matters: Less than a month ago, FBI director Christopher Wray formally apologized to the U.S. gymnasts abused by Nassar, noting that the FBI's failure to stop Nassar was "inexcusable." His apology came after four gymnasts — including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney — testified before the committee and detailed how the FBI mishandled their reports.

Then a Democrat takes office, at which point GOP lawmakers who didn't care at all about the deficit suddenly decide it's a critical issue that the new center-left president must immediately prioritize.

__label__3 Rep. Pramila Jayapal: $1.5 trillion for economic bill is 'too small' and 'not going to happen'House Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said Sunday that the $1.5 trillion figure for the economic bill was "too small," but wouldn't say whether she would accept the $2.1 trillion dollar price tag that is being floated. "That's not going to happen," Jayapal told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" when pressed on the $1.5 trillion number. "That's too small to get our priorities in. It's going to be somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5, and I think the White House is working on that right now because, remember,...

__label__5 How A New Team Of Feds Hacked The Hackers And Got Colonial Pipeline's Ransom BackThe Department of Justice on Monday touted the recovery of $2.3 million — about half — of the ransom that was collected by hackers in the Colonial Pipeline attack last month. Experts say it was a surprising outcome to an increasingly frequent and severe crime. "Ransomware is very seldom recovered," said April Falcon Doss, executive director of the Institute for Technology Law and Policy at Georgetown Law, who described it as "a really big win" for the government. "What we don't know is whether or not this is going to pave the...
__label__3 Facing a heap of defeat, progressives stake hopes on spending billImmigration, voting rights, policing, gun control: Congress is filled with liberal hopes crushed by the reality of slim Democratic majorities. So progressives are digging in on what could be their last chance at success in years. As Democrats race to pull together a multitrillion-dollar party-line social spending package, Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s left flank is pushing as hard as it can to see progressive priorities reflected. They’ve repeatedly vowed to tank a bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor as soon as this week if they don’t see more movement — a...

__label__5 The FBI's Strange Anthrax Investigation Sheds Light on COVID Lab-Leak Theory and Fauci's EmailsOPINIONOne of the most significant events of the last two decades has been largely memory-holed: the October, 2001 anthrax attacks in the U.S. Beginning just one week after 9/11 and extending for another three weeks, a highly weaponized and sophisticated strain of anthrax had been sent around the country through the U.S. Postal Service addressed to some of the country's most prominent political and media figures. As Americans were still reeling from the devastation of 9/11, the anthrax killed five Americans and sickened another seventeen.
__label__3 White House to tell U.S. agencies to prepare for first government shutdown of pandemicThe White House budget office will tell federal agencies on Thursday to begin preparations for the first shutdown of the U.S. government since the pandemic began, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggle to reach a funding agreement. Administration officials stress the request is in line with traditional procedures seven days ahead of a shutdown and not a commentary on the likelihood of a congressional deal. Both Democrats and Republicans have made clear they intend to fund the government before its funding expires on Sept. 30, but time is running out...
__label__2 Two Louisville Police Officers Involved in Raid That Killed Breonna Taylor Receive Termination NoticesThe Louisville police officer who shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her home, along with the detective who prepared the search warrant for the deadly raid, were both told on Tuesday that they face dismissal from the force more than nine months after Taylor’s death.

__label__3 Why Biden isn’t hitting the panic button on the debt ceiling — yetAs the nation barrels toward fiscal catastrophe, President Joe Biden is intent, for now, to keep his powder dry. Senate Republicans are rebuffing an effort by Democrats to lift the nation’s debt ceiling through a government funding bill that would require 60 votes. And they’re doing so while relying on the unusual argument that while members of the GOP wholeheartedly want to see the debt limit raised or suspended, they just don’t want to be the ones to do it. That’s left Biden with few options: Plow forward with the...

He’s backchanneling with his colleagues, shadowboxing with progressives through the media and feeding GOP hopes that he’ll scale down the bill.  Manchin, for his part, says he’s being clear in an effort to not catch anyone off guard.   “Everybody knows my position,”...

__label__3 Trump shattered tradition on Fed chair. Some Dems want Biden to do the same.ANALYSISLeft-leaning activists and lawmakers are pushing President Joe Biden to dump Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for Fed Governor Lael Brainard with a last-ditch message: Don’t miss a rare opportunity to install a known and tested Democrat atop the world’s most important economic institution. It’s a conundrum for Biden. He can stick with Powell, a choice that would please markets — renominating someone from the opposite party as Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did — or put his own stamp on the Fed for years as President...

An authorization is an important regulatory step toward reaching about 28 million children of these ages, most of them back in school for in-person learning. The FDA need not follow the advice of its outside experts, but usually does. While children rarely become seriously ill or die from COVID-19, some develop complications, and COVID-19 cases in unvaccinated children have risen...

__label__2 A Trump-Boris Axis?It’s high spirits this holiday season for most proponents of the “new nationalism.” Boris Johnson’s savage performance against his socialist opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, has populist-nationalists on both sides of the Atlantic licking their chops. Perhaps, it truly is a new age of “one nation conservatism.” Johnson’s romp, the thinking goes, will presage a consecration of the Trump movement in America with the president’s re-election next year. In the meantime, both sides hope to work together—and borrow from each others’ playbooks. A central facet of Johnson’s victorious strategy was to emphasize...
__label__5 FDA OKs mixing COVID vaccines; backs Moderna, J&J boostersU.S. regulators on Wednesday signed off on extending COVID-19 boosters to Americans who got the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine and said anyone eligible for an extra dose can get a brand different from the one they received initially. The Food and Drug Administration’s decisions mark a big step toward expanding the U.S. booster campaign, which began with extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine last month. But before more people roll up their sleeves, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will consult an expert panel Thursday before finalizing...
__label__3 Moderate Democrats Continue To Hold Hostage Joe Biden’s Legislative AgendaANALYSISPresident Joe Biden’s legislative agenda is being squeezed from both ideological wings of his party, creating a huge headache for Democratic leaders as they race to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure and pass other social programs. On the one side, a group of moderate House Democrats is demanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) schedule a vote on the Senate-passed bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill as soon as possible ― before turning to a $3.5 trillion partisan spending measure dealing with climate, health care, housing and more.

The pledge, in a letter released early Friday, is a major rift that threatens the carefully choreographed, two-track effort by congressional Democrats and the Biden administration to enact both a trillion-dollar, bipartisan infrastructure deal and an even more ambitious — but...

Now he'll need to bring his leery moderates along for the whole meal. The Senate majority leader is not known for putting a hard whip on his members, yet Schumer's willingness to dish tough truths to the likes of Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin — not to mention Bernie Sanders — amounts to his recipe for delivery on President Joe Biden's domestic agenda. It started a few weeks ago, when...
__label__1 Media Bias May Be Boris Johnson’s Biggest AdversaryOPINIONBritain’s biggest broadcasters have dedicated themselves to defeating Brexit, denigrating Johnson, and ‘educating’ their gullible supporters. Next Thursday’s election pitting Boris Johnson of the Conservatives against Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour party isn’t the only political war in Britain. Much of the broadcast media — ostensibly required to be impartial — has set itself the goal of derailing both Boris and Brexit. Britain’s key broadcasters — the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 — are neither state-owned nor state controlled. But they operate under strict public-service rules that require them to...
__label__5 Vaping: FDA approves e-cigarette in US for first timeThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medical products in the US, has approved an e-cigarette for sale for the first time. It authorised the marketing of three products from RJ Reynolds, under the Vuse brand. The FDA decided that the benefit to adults trying to quit smoking outweighs the risk of teenagers becoming hooked. The permitted products are tobacco-flavoured, as opposed to the sweet flavours popular with younger people. E-cigarettes have been widely sold in the US for the past decade, but their take-up by teenagers has caused...

Many said they’d eaten chicken, and federal food safety inspectors found the strain in chicken breasts, sausages and wings during routine sampling at poultry plants. But what seemed like a straightforward outbreak soon took a mystifying turn. Cases surfaced as far away as Texas and Missouri. A 1-year-old boy from...

The Food and Drug Administration’s clearance of the shot for people 16 years and older is the agency’s first full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine. The decision was expected this week, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported. The vaccine was first cleared in December by the FDA on an emergency-use basis for people 16 years and older after the drugmakers showed...

How much will this increase doubt among the unvaccinated?ANALYSISThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is planning to warn that Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose COVID-19 vaccine can lead to an increased risk of a rare neurological condition known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The warning does not involve the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, which are much more widely used in the United States. This will not help calm nerves or quiet vaccine doubters, though it could send a signal that the FDA is serious about ensuring the public knows about even small risks. People familiar with the FDA’s plans tell The New York...

Taco Bell offers an even more enticing proposition: Its beef-laden “Grande Crunchwrap Meal” delivers 1290 calories for just $5. For years, critics of the US food system—Eric Schlosser, Michael Pollan, Raj Patel,  Leah Penniman, Marion Nestle, others—have warned that such deals are actually no bargain when you add in the hidden costs. Those include poverty wages for workers from the farm field to the franchise counter; precious topsoil surrendered to the growing corn and...

Why it matters: The two authorized batches amount to approximately 10 million doses of J&J's single-shot vaccine, according to AP. The doses could end up being used in the U.S. or exported to other countries. The state of play: The FDA said it conducted a "thorough review of...

The claim of causality, however, is less certain. Since April 2020 the Household Pulse Survey, carried out by the Census Bureau, has asked a representative sample of American adults whether there was enough to eat in their household over the previous week. The share who respond either that there is...

The chemicals, called 6:2 FTOH, are now linked to a range of serious health issues, and Americans are still being exposed to them in greaseproof pizza boxes, carryout containers, fast-food wrappers, and paperboard packaging. The companies initially told the FDA that the compounds were safer and less likely to accumulate in...

The effort, which is more political messaging than anything, is led by Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont. It comes as at least five moderate Democrats remain undecided on the controversial nominee with a history of working for major gun control groups, and as the timing for Chipman's final confirmation remains unclear. The White House and a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not...

A day after top U.S. health officials announced plans to begin vaccinating Americans as early as mid-December, British regulators granted emergency use approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc along with Germany’s BioNTech SE. Dr. Jose Romero, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said...
__label__3 We Throw Out More Than 2 Trillion Pounds of Food Every Year, UN SaysPeople waste more than two trillion pounds of food a year, a UN report has revealed. It is the most comprehensive assessment to date and found waste was about double the previous best estimate. The food discarded in homes alone was 163 pounds per person each year on average around the world, the UN found. In the UK, which has some of the best data, the edible waste represents about eight meals per household each week. The UN report also includes data on food waste in restaurants and shops, with...
__label__1 Cruz Leads 24 GOP Senators to File Amicus Brief in Supreme Court Case Protecting Second AmendmentSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, led 24 other Republican senators to file an amicus brief, arguing that the New York state laws making it hard to carry a gun outside the home violate the Second Amendment. In regards to the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen case, which is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, the senators wrote, “[L]egislators—whether in Albany or Washington, D.C.—have neither the power nor the authority to second-guess the policy judgments made by the Framers and...
__label__5 FDA clears a ‘new generation’ of Covid antibody test designed to tell how well someone is protected against the virusThe FDA on Wednesday authorized one of the first Covid-19 tests that measures the amount of neutralizing antibodies produced by the body’s immune system after exposure to the virus — a “new generation” of coronavirus test that is designed to tell how well someone is protected against infection. A person’s immune system produces antibodies to combat viruses and other foreign pathogens that invade the body. When it comes to Covid-19, it remains unclear how much protection antibodies provide and how long that might last, but this test could help researchers...
__label__3 U.S. Diet Guidelines Sidestep Scientific Advice to Cut Sugar and AlcoholRejecting the advice of its scientific advisers, the federal government has released new dietary recommendations that sound a familiar nutritional refrain, advising Americans to “make every bite count” while dismissing expert recommendations to sharply reduce consumption of sugar and alcoholic beverages. The “Dietary Guidelines for Americans” are updated every five years, and the latest iteration arrived on Tuesday, 10 months into a pandemic that has posed a historic health threat to Americans. Confined to their homes, even those who have dodged the coronavirus itself are drinking more and gaining weight,...
__label__1 Barely Legal Teens Can Legally Buy Guns, Appeals Court SaysANALYSISThe constitutional right to bear arms enshrined in the Second Amendment should apply to those between the ages of 18–20, declared the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit today in Hirschfeld v. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Tanner Hirschfeld and Natalia Marshall challenged the constitutionality of federal laws that ban federally licensed firearm dealers from selling handguns and handgun ammunition to 18–20 year olds. Those federal restrictions have been on the books since 1968. Hirschfeld is now over 21 but Marshall is not. She felt she had...
__label__5 The Sooner the FDA Is Disbanded, the Better For Us AllANALYSISThe Food and Drug Administration must go. And salt should be sown where once it stood. This organization is costly, is a gargantuan waste of time and causes needless deaths by slowing down innovation. The sooner is it disbanded, the better. This seems a bit harsh. Ok, excessively severe. Does not the FDA stand between us and pharmaceutical firms that would exploit us but for its heroic efforts? Does not the FDA ensure the quality of, wait for it, food and drugs? Does not the FDA serve as an excellent...
__label__3 In the Wealthiest Country in History, Americans Are Desperately Struggling With HungerOPINIONFor a few short weeks last spring, it seemed like the tectonic plates of America’s political consensus could be about to shift. Amid talk of massive public spending, enhanced support for the unemployed, and even the conscription of private industry under the Defense Production Act, it momentarily appeared that the pandemic might at least put a dent in decades of bipartisan aversion to social democracy and activist government. Following an initial burst of activity, of course, Washington’s chronic addiction to markets and hostility to social welfare provisions soon returned, with...
__label__2 Biden’s Blunders And Lies About Firearms And The Second AmendmentOPINIONProfessional “fact checkers” at the Washington Post and elsewhere aren’t notable for their pro-gun bias. In the past, for example, these propagandists have condemned as incorrect claims that Hillary Clinton doesn’t believe in the right to keep a gun at home for self-defense, and that Joe Biden supports gun confiscation, while using the same framework of politically desirable reality to uphold bogus gun control talking points – for instance, Biden’s statements that no background checks are required for firearm purchases at gun shows, that gun manufacturers are the only entities “exempt from being sued,” and that the Clinton...
__label__4 Toxic hand sanitizer: FDA warns consumers to avoid 9 hand sanitizer brandsThe Food and Drug Administration released a warning statement on June 19 saying consumers should not buy hand sanitizer products from the Mexico-based manufacturer Eskbiochem. The warning comes after the FDA discovered methanol, or wood alcohol, in these products. Methanol can be dangerous when ingested or absorbed through the skin, and it can be fatal in large quantities.
__label__3 Will Biden Pick a USDA Secretary Who Sees Our Food Crises Clearly?ANALYSISThe next secretary of the US Department of Agriculture will confront two of the most dire problems facing the nation: spiking levels of hunger brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, and the damage that ever-increasing climate chaos visits upon our most productive farming regions. The New York Times will tell you a different story. According to a recent article in the paper, President-elect Joe Biden’s decision about who should run the USDA hinges not on climate or hunger policy expertise, but rather on the question of...
__label__2 Report: Joe Biden’s Gun Control Push Hurts Democrats in 2022A report by Fox News claims President Joe Biden’s push for gun control as part of the solution to surging crime is detrimental to the Democrat effort to hold Congress in 2022. Fox News claims the gun control-laden response to crime could be even more detrimental, when seen in combination with the efforts to hamper police around the country: Biden’s focus on gun crimes could provide fodder for Second Amendment advocates who have accused him of attacking legal gun ownership and for Republican lawmakers who have argued that Democratic calls to “defund...

__label__3 Is Walmart Providing ‘Free Thanksgiving Dinner for All’?FACT CHECKWhat's True: Walmart partnered with Ibotta and other companies to offer cash back rewards on Thanksgiving staples, totaling $20.27 in savings on turkey, stuffing, and other items. What's False: The offers are only good for specific items from specific brands, and shoppers will have to pay Walmart for the items before receiving the cash back rewards from Ibotta. What's Undetermined: The offer is only available while supplies last, so it's possible some of the items may not be in stock at all Walmart locations leading up to Thanksgiving Day.
__label__2 San Jose Wants to Force Gun Owners to Carry Insurance and Pay FeesOn Tuesday, the San Jose City Council unanimously advanced a number of novel gun control proposals, including requirements that gun owners carry liability insurance and that they pay a fee to cover the public costs of gun violence. "While the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, it does not require taxpayers to subsidize gun ownership," said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo in a Tuesday press release. "We won't magically end gun violence, but we will stop paying for it." These proposals come a month after a workplace shooting at a light...
__label__4 Physicians, ACLU sue FDA over abortion pill limitsA group of medical providers represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday, challenging federal requirements that limit how medication abortions are dispensed. The medical group coalition, led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, opposes an FDA restriction on mifepristone, a drug used to end a pregnancy or for miscarriage management. Medication abortions use a two-pill regimen to end a pregnancy. Under federal regulations, a mifepristone pill must be administered in person at a health care office or hospital and cannot...

__label__4 Federal agencies warn about untested COVID-19 drugs Trump toutsThe Food and Drug Administration warned Friday against the risk of irregular heart rhythms from the use of anti-malaria drugs President Donald Trump touted, a day after he made controversial comments — which scientists quickly rebuked — incorrectly suggesting that disinfectant injected into patients or light could kill COVID-19. The president has repeatedly hyped the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible COVID-19 treatment despite no conclusive evidence that the drug is successful for this purpose. Recent preliminary studies found little evidence that it should be used to treat the coronavirus...
__label__2 As Stimulus Runs Out, 56% of US Household Are Worried About Affording FoodMore than half of households in the United States are not “very confident” that they can afford to put food on the table as the holidays approach, according to federal Census data. Meanwhile, what remains of federal pandemic relief programs is set to expire before the end of year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far refused to take up a $2.2 trillion economic relief package passed by Democrats months ago, even after Democrats attempted to compromise with Republicans and lowered the price tag by $1.2 trillion. If Congress...
__label__1 State Legislators Want to Nullify Federal Gun ControlANALYSISState legislators across the country are working to weaken the enforcement of federal gun laws by emulating immigration activists. As President Joe Biden takes executive action to strengthen federal gun laws, state legislators across the country are working to weaken their enforcement by emulating immigration activists. Since 1987, Oregon has prohibited law enforcement agencies from arresting or detaining people whose only crime was entering or living in the U.S. illegally. Hundreds of other jurisdictions have followed suit, becoming so-called sanctuary cities. "The methods that we need to use are the...

Even more alarming, the proportion of American children who sometimes do not have enough to eat is now as much as 14 times higher than it was last year. The Agriculture Department conducts yearly studies on food insecurity in the U.S., with its report on 2019 released this month. The Census Bureau began frequent household surveys in April...
__label__1 Federal Judge Overturns California's Ban on 'Assault-Style' WeaponsA federal judge overturned California's 32-year-old ban on so-called assault-style weapons on Friday, describing it as a "failed experiment" and prompting scathing criticism from the state's governor and attorney general.California has prohibited the sale of the weapons since 1989. The ban was challenged in a 2019 lawsuit against California's attorney general by plaintiffs including James Miller, a state resident, and the San Diego County Gun Owners, a political action committee.
__label__5 $1.75 trillion for Biden's agenda is a lot, but is it enough?President Biden on Thursday unveiled a framework for a $1.75 trillion Build Back Better domestic spending plan, a major step in the effort to turn his signature legislative goal into reality. In a speech promoting the plan, Biden said it represents “historic investments in our nation and in our people.” There’s truth to that claim. The bill includes $555 billion to combat climate change, which would be by far the most substantial climate investment ever made by the federal government. It would also establish a nationwide universal preschool program, provide money to help families...
__label__3 The US food system is killing AmericansOPINIONThis global pandemic has given a new meaning to the idea of American exceptionalism. The United States is faring far worse than other countries and shoulders a disproportionate share of global disease burden -- with 4% of the global population, yet, at the time of writing, nearly a quarter of global Covid-19 fatalities. While much of the rationale has focused on our government's flat-footed response and poor public health infrastructure, this ignores a significant and underrecognized risk factor -- the exceedingly poor baseline health of our country's population. Among the...
__label__1 Biden's ATF nominee stumped on defining 'assault weapon' during confirmation hearingPresident Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was stumped during his confirmation hearing when he was asked to define an “assault weapon." “I got 35 seconds left, define it for me, would you please, sir. What's an assault weapon?” Sen. John Kennedy asked ATF nominee David Chipman on Wednesday. "There's no way I could define an assault weapon," Chipman said. “I'll give you one definition that ATF currently uses" Chipman continued, as Kennedy interjected that he wanted Chipman’s personal definition.
__label__5 Democrats Weigh Tax Alternatives to Fund $2 Trillion PackageDemocrats worked to quickly find new sources of revenue to pay for their roughly $2 trillion social-policy and climate package, seeking to target businesses and wealthy individuals in novel ways after proposed rate increases ran aground in talks. The continued opposition by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) to any increases in top marginal rates on corporations, individuals or capital gains has emerged as a major hurdle in the party’s quest to reach a new framework on the legislation. A person familiar with Ms. Sinema’s thinking said she has agreed to enough alternative...
__label__3 Bars Are Serving Ridiculous $1 Menu Items to Stay Open During COVID RestrictionsOn Friday, a new executive order from New York governor Andrew Cuomo went into effect, one that requires any bar or restaurant patron to buy some kind of food if they want to order alcohol. Additionally, the bar areas themselves can only be used by seated customers who are spaced at least six feet apart from each other or have some kind of physical barrier between them. "As we continue our science-based phased reopening, the number of hospitalizations and our rate of positive tests remain steady and low," Cuomo said....

__label__4 Debt crisis averted, but at what cost?After punting on the debt, Democrats in Congress now face a critical stretch, with President Biden’s domestic agenda on the line. Recent weeks have exposed real rifts within, as well as between, the parties. With Tuesday’s 219-206 vote along party lines to increase the U.S. debt limit by $480 billion, House Democrats averted a possible global financial meltdown just one week before Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had warned that the United States would run out of funds and default. But Congress’ – and the country’s – problems remain far from...
__label__3 Does Food Actually Unite Us?It's true that everybody eats. Though the specifics of how and what we eat differ across cultures, countries, class status, and whatever else separates us, the fact that we all must feed ourselves is the foundation for an entire niche of food content. In shows like Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown, Dave Chang's Ugly Delicious, Andrew Zimmern's What's Eating America, and most recently, Padma Lakshmi's new Hulu series Taste the Nation, food is relational; as unlikely companions band together over the act of eating, food becomes a way to find commonality...
__label__2 The DOJ Released A 115-Page Rule Change To Redefine A ‘Firearm.’ Here’s What You Need To Know.ANALYSISOn Friday, The Department of Justice published a 115-page document detailing a proposed rule change that would redefine what constitutes a firearm. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the new definition “take[s] into account technological developments and modern terminology in the firearms industry, as well as amendments to the marking and recordkeeping requirements.” The newly proposed rule would redefine a “ghost gun” or precursor firearm parts as a firearm under federal law. As of now, a “ghost gun” is defined as any homemade firearm that...

"My objective is to get everything that I campaigned on passed, eventually. It won't all happen at once," Biden told reporters this week during a trip to Michigan, making the argument that temporary new benefits and tax breaks would likely become permanent, if they gain popularity with voters over time. But Biden doesn't have that same luxury when it comes to...
__label__3 White People Own 98 Percent of Rural Land. Young Black Farmers Want to Reclaim Their Share.Black people have largely been expelled from the US agricultural landscape. In 1920, nearly a million Black farmers worked on 41.4 million acres of land, making up a seventh of farm owners. Today, only about 49,000 of them remain, making up just 1.4 percent of the nation’s farm owners, and tending a scant 4.7 million acres—a nearly 90 percent loss. This didn’t happen by accident. Since Emancipation, Black farmers have had to fight for a share of this country’s fertile ground, due to a history of racist policies and land...
__label__2 ATF's Proposed Rules Threaten a Legal Mess but No End to Ghost GunsANALYSISRegulations might reshape DIY gun products, but they can’t eliminate the demand that created the industry. There's little reason to expect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) proposed "ghost gun" regulations to actually eliminate ghost guns. That doesn't mean that plans to regulate the market for 80 percent receivers and otherwise impose new red tape on gun users and makers won't have an impact—they will undoubtedly create headaches for many people. But it does mean that the vague verbiage in the proposed rules has a long way...
__label__4 U.S. Senate to vote on debt ceiling, Republicans say they will opposeWASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's Democrats planned a Wednesday vote in the Senate to suspend the U.S. debt ceiling, setting up yet another confrontation with Republicans that risks an economically crippling federal credit default. The effort seemed destined to fail as the chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday that members of his party would block the vote as they have already done twice. McConnell has urged Democrats to raise the debt ceiling on their own using a more convoluted approach that Democrats have dismissed as...

Where are you from?” Dunning understood the woman wanted to know her ethnicity. But when she answered, “Inuit,” she got a blank stare. Finally, Dunning said, “I’m Eskimo.” She dislikes the term, but caricatures of her ethnic group in popular culture, including food branding, make it the term non-Indigenous people know best. Eskimo Pie, which has been around since 1921, features...
__label__2 California May Soften Gun Crime Laws, Citing Impact On People Of ColorA California state assembly committee gave its stamp of approval on April 27 to legislation that would significantly soften sentences for people convicted of some firearm offenses, with proponents saying laws against using guns in the commission of crimes disproportionately affect people of color. The Assembly Public Safety Committee voted 6-2 to approve the Anti-Racism Sentencing Reform Act, though the proposal still has several hurdles to clear before becoming law.

The debt limit is a cap on how much the Treasury Department can borrow to fund federal operations. Congress sets the debt limit, as required by federal law and consistent with the Constitution, which gives Congress the “power of the purse.” The limit,...

But one thing everyone agrees on is that the bill must...

But now, because of the resurgent coronavirus due to the delta variant and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan, President Biden's approval rating has dropped. His reduced influence and political capital don't leave much room for error on items that might be difficult to get through Congress. And it doesn't get much more challenging than the path Democratic leaders are going down,...
__label__3 "Exceptionally dire": Secondary impacts of COVID-19 could increase global poverty and hungerMORE THAN 240,000 people worldwide have already died of Covid-19, and before the pandemic finishes, it could kill hundreds of thousands, even millions, more. But the final toll is destined to be far higher than just those who die of Covid-19. Experts warn that deaths from secondary impacts — poverty, hunger, diseases, and violence exacerbated by the pandemic — may dwarf the number of those who die of the novel coronavirus itself. A new analysis by researchers from King’s College London and Australian National University, under the aegis of the...

The opinion (pdf), issued on Oct. 14, was in response to a request from Dannette Smith, CEO of the state’s Department of Health, which licenses and disciplines doctors.

__label__3 The Food Supply Chain is Not Yet in Danger — But the Workers Who Keep Us Fed AreARE WE GOING to run out of food? That primal question seemed to be on the minds of many Americans when the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic first became clear.

But people turned their eyes to the food section as well, clearing out shelves of whatever might be deemed useful in an apocalypse.

Slimming down the cost of the Democrats’ massive $3.5 trillion social-welfare spending bill is a compromise that misses the point. Opposition to the tax-and-spending bill is not just about cost, it’s about a policy agenda that shifts more power and control to the federal government and away from...

The judge said defendants, state officials, failed to adequately explain why workers were denied from religious exemptions to a vaccine mandate imposed in August. “There is no adequate explanation from defendants about why the ‘reasonable accommodation’ that must be extended to a medically exempt health care worker under 2.61 could not similarly be extended to a healthcare worker with a sincere religious objection,” U.S. District Judge...

Just a few days back, gas prices in California hit their highest level ever. This week, however, some of the pressure has started to lift. What's happening: West Texas Intermediate futures, the US benchmark for oil prices, and Brent futures, the global benchmark, are now trading at their lowest levels in six weeks on signals that supply constraints could begin to ease soon. In the United...
__label__2 ‘We Will Be Replacing People’: NY Gov. Says Healthcare Workers Who Won’t Take The Vaccine Will Get The BootDemocratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned Wednesday while visiting a Rochester hospital that healthcare workers who do not get vaccinated by the Sept. 27 deadline are replaceable. “To all the healthcare providers, doctors and nurses in particular who are vaccinated, I say thank you. Because you are keeping true to your oath.” “To those who won’t, we will be replacing people,” she added, according to CBS 6 Albany. Hochul said the state is working on replacing unvaccinated health care workers and would be working with hospitals that do not have...
__label__4 Here's What The Historic Increase In Food Stamp Benefits Could Mean For YouWith all the developments in Afghanistan and Haiti, you may have missed this historic announcement out of Washington: The Biden administration has approved updates to the program known as SNAP, giving families who currently receive food stamps the largest single increase in benefits to date. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday released a re-evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan, which is used to calculate SNAP benefits, based on changes to nutritional guidance, food prices and what Americans eat. Its new calculations mean that the average SNAP benefit will increase by $36.24...
__label__2 Biden says U.S. has "commitment" to defend Taiwan if China attacksPresident Joe Biden said on Thursday that the United States would defend Taiwan if China ever attacked the democratically governed island. The White House quickly walked back his remark as analysts tried to discern whether Mr. Biden might have been signalling a change in Washington's long-held policy of "strategic ambiguity" over the role the U.S. would play in the event of a military conflict between China and Taiwan.  "Yes, we have a commitment," the president declared after being asked during a CNN Town Hall in Baltimore, Maryland whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the...
__label__2 COVID-19 Hospital Admissions Fall for 1st Time in Weeks Across US: HHSHospital admissions for COVID-19 patients in the United States are declining for the first time since late June, suggesting the latest surge has peaked. The seven-day average of new daily hospitalizations with confirmed COVID-19 dropped by 2.4 percent from a week earlier to about 12,280—the first such drop since around June 27, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It comes as fewer hospitalizations are being reported in Florida, Texas, and other Southern states, the agency said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 tracker shows that the seven-day...
__label__4 America's deepening drinking habitANALYSISAmericans responded to the stress of the pandemic by drinking more — a lot more for some — and there's a risk that those habits could stick. Why it matters: Excessive drinking is connected to a variety of health and social ills, but the growing ubiquity of alcohol in daily life can make cutting back harder than ever. By the numbers: Americans started drinking more as soon as the pandemic began in full last year — data from Nielsen showed a 54% increase in national alcohol sales year-on-year in the week ending on March 21,...
__label__3 France Is Outraged by U.S. Nuclear Submarine Deal With AustraliaFrance reacted with fury on Thursday to President Biden’s announcement of a deal to help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarines, calling it a “unilateral, brutal, unpredictable decision” that resembled the rash and sudden policy shifts common during the Trump administration. The angry words from Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign minister, in an interview with Franceinfo radio, followed an official statement from him and Florence Parly, the minister of the Armed Forces, calling “the American choice to exclude a European ally and partner such as France” a “regrettable decision” that “shows a lack...
__label__1 Key Medicare Fund Will Be Insolvent in Just Five YearsANALYSISFive years. That's how long until Medicare officially can't pay all of its bills, according to the latest report on the program's fiscal health. After that, without changes, the program will start to miss payments. Medicare is on track for a serious fiscal meltdown.  First, the gory details: Starting in 2026, the program's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, which covers a variety of inpatient hospital services, will be depleted, leaving the fund to operate on a cash-flow basis—and there won't be enough cash coming into the program to pay all of the...
__label__5 Biden’s not coming after beef. But should he?Not too long ago, a number of Republican lawmakers and conservative media figures railed against President Biden over the claim that he was going to greatly restrict the amount of beef Americans are allowed to eat. There is no truth to the allegation. Biden has put forward an aggressive plan to combat climate change, but his proposals don’t include any measures aimed at regulating how much meat people consume. The claim, which first appeared in an article in the British tabloid the Daily Mail in April, quickly gained traction among conservatives despite its inaccuracy....
__label__3 Look Who’s Backing Biden’s Foreign Policy: The KochsANALYSISIn the days following the fall of Kabul and the collapse of the Afghan government, the Biden administration found itself locking arms with a group that’s long been radioactive in the Democratic Party: the Kochs. Rewind a decade, and the billionaire Koch brothers were the bête noire of the Obama administration, singled out by the president and his allies — including then-Vice President Joe Biden — as a singularly destructive force in American politics. “What we’re worried about is the Koch brothers and their friends bringing in millions and millions...
__label__2 American Medical Association Faces Backlash for Calling to Remove Sex From Birth CertificatesThe American Medical Association (AMA), the largest organization of physicians and medical students in the United States, came under fire over the weekend for a recent proposal calling to end the designation of sex on birth certificates. The proposal (pdf), which was adopted by the AMA’s Board of Trustees in June, states that recording the baby’s sex on the public portion of birth certificates, as has always been the case, has “potential for discrimination.” “Our American Medical Association will advocate for the removal of sex as a legal designation on the public...

__label__3 Let’s Not Pretend That the Way We Withdrew From Afghanistan Was the ProblemOPINIONIn 2005, two of my colleagues at The American Prospect, Sam Rosenfeld and Matt Yglesias, wrote an essay I think about often. It was called “The Incompetence Dodge,” and it argued that American policymakers and pundits routinely try to rescue the reputation of bad ideas by attributing their failure to poor execution. At the time, they were writing about the liberal hawks who were blaming the catastrophe of the Iraq war on the Bush administration’s maladministration rather than rethinking the enterprise in its totality. But the same dynamic suffuses the...
__label__1 Biden Claims Hospitals Could Run Out of Beds Due to Coronavirus SurgeANALYSISCLAIM: A coronavirus surge means that “if someone else has a heart attack, or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.” VERDICT: PROBABLY FALSE. Hospitals did not run out of beds during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will require all federal employees, and employees of federal contractors, to be vaccinated for coronavirus, or else submit to regular testing and be required to wear masks. He proposed an incentive of $100 to encourage unvaccinated people to...

__label__3 What the US Didn’t Learn in Afghanistan, According to the Government’s Own Inspector GeneralThe chaotic collapse of the Afghan military in recent months made starkly clear that the $83 billion U.S. taxpayers spent to create and fund those security forces achieved little. But a new report this week by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction also reveals the depths of failure of the United States’ entire 20-year, $145 billion effort to reconstruct (or construct, in some cases) Afghanistan’s civil society. John Sopko, the special inspector general since 2012, has long chronicled the government’s miscalculations. In his latest lacerating assessment, he concluded that “the U.S....

General Assembly on Friday. World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley and World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke during a special meeting on COVID-19, which emerged in China late last year and has so far infected 65 million globally.

__label__3 A new Supreme Court case could blow up decades of US diplomacyANALYSISTexas v. Biden, a case with profound implications for American foreign policy, reached the Supreme Court with lightning speed. On August 13, a judge in Texas appointed by then-President Donald Trump effectively ordered the Biden administration to permanently reinstate Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. That policy, which is officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), requires many immigrants who seek asylum in the United States to stay in Mexico while they await a hearing. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s opinion in Texas was wrong for many reasons, including that he completely misread federal immigration law....
__label__2 Poll finds 71% of Americans oppose vaccine mandatesThe American people are overwhelmingly opposed to vaccine mandates and believe that the decision on whether to get vaccinated against COVID-19 should be a "personal choice," according to a new national survey. A nationwide issues survey of likely general election voters conducted by the Trafalgar Group in partnership with Convention of States Action found that 71.4% of respondents said taking COVID-19 vaccines should be a personal choice. Just 21.8% said vaccination should be mandatory, while 6.8% were unsure. Rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.S. have in recent...

But by lunchtime the next day I am sure I will find room for another roast. When you think about it, it is pretty weird that the day after an enormous meal we can eat exactly the same quantity again. Did we not learn our lesson the first time? Why do we still feel hungry after feasts like Thanksgiving or Christmas? Does overeating “stretch” your stomach, meaning...
__label__3 For Many Afghans, the US Occupation Was Just as Bad as the TalibanOPINIONThe Taliban’s rapid takeover of Afghanistan has beamed startling and awful scenes into our consciousness: government workers and journalists hiding as Taliban fighters search houses; women being forced off the streets to cover up at gunpoint; a desperate crowd of thousands camping in the Kabul airport, desperate to get out; crowds chasing and clinging to a plane as it takes off, some of them later falling to their deaths. With the Taliban swiftly overrunning the country and fears of an impending wave of human rights violations rife, the once-majority support...
__label__2 Democrats’ Reckless Medicare ExpansionANALYSISInstead of fixing our broken entitlements, Democrats want to make them more generous than socialist Canada’s. When the United States entered World War II and rapidly ramped up military production, it drove debt to its largest share of the economy in the nation’s history. But as the crisis ended, that spending wound down, and debt returned to more sustainable levels. What is happening now is something quite different. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the U.S. was already on an unsustainable fiscal path, primarily as a result of spending on entitlements....
__label__4 10 ways you can help other people this Thanksgiving: ‘There is always a need for food assistance’The country’s most food-centric holiday is likely to inspire a deluge of donations and volunteerism — but do-gooders should keep up the action even after Thanksgiving passes, advocates say. Pandemic restrictions have left millions of people jobless and many children without subsidized school meals, heightening food insecurity. More than 50 million people in the U.S., including 17 million children, could experience food insecurity in 2020, found an updated analysis published in October by Feeding America, a nonprofit network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs across...
__label__3 Former President George W. Bush says U.S. must help Afghan refugeesAs thousands attempt to flee Afghanistan following the rapid Taliban takeover, former President George W. Bush says the United States has the responsibility and resources to help refugees and should "secure safe passage for them now, without bureaucratic delay." The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan as the U.S. withdrew its forces from the 20-year U.S.-led war, which began during Mr. Bush's first term. Taliban fighters took control of the presidential palace on Sunday, and on Monday huge crowds of civilians were seen desperately clamoring to escape the capital, flooding its airport.
__label__1 Can Halloween survive the war on holidays?ANALYSISFirst came the war on Christmas, then the war on Columbus Day. Could Halloween be next? It’s already happening in some school districts, where administrators have deemed the beloved fall celebration inappropriate because it’s not inclusive enough. The latest school district to ditch Halloween was in Melrose, Massachusetts, a town about 7 miles north of Boston. There, Superintendent Julie Kukenberger wrote to parents that the school district wants to “deemphasize” Halloween in favor of “community building through fall celebrations,” according to Boston 25 News. “I am working in collaboration with...
__label__4 Sustainable Food Trends Will Become Center Of The Plate With Modern ConsumersA majority of consumers today look for products that can help them live a more sustainable, socially responsible life. Assuming taste and price are often roughly equal, the modern consumer prefers sustainable food brands and adds them to their digital and physical shopping carts daily. My belief from both Barkley consumer research and dozens of CMO interviews is this: the future of sustainable foods will live at the intersection of people, planet and community.   Need proof? Our research shows that modern consumers lean into brands that are socially...
__label__3 U.S. envoy touted peace in Afghanistan. 18 months later, peace is nowhere to be foundANALYSISA year and a half since U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad brokered a “peace agreement” between the United States and Taliban leaders, there is no peace in Afghanistan. Instead of negotiating a power-sharing deal with the Afghan government, the Taliban have unleashed a military onslaught to take power by force, seizing on the withdrawal of U.S. troops as their moment of opportunity. As Afghanistan plunged into chaos in recent days, with civilians flooding into the capital Kabul to escape the advancing Taliban, Khalilzad made a last-ditch bid to try to stop the bloodletting.

__label__5 'Children Are Going Hungry': Why Schools Are Struggling To Feed StudentsSix months into schools' pandemic-driven experiment in distance learning, much has been said (and debated) about whether children are learning. But the more urgent question, for the more than 30 million kids who depend on U.S. schools for free or reduced-price meals, is this: Are they eating? The answer, based on recent data and interviews with school nutrition leaders and anti-hunger advocates across the country, is alarming. Among low-income households with children who qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, only about 15% have been getting those meals, said Lauren...

Dust coats the chairs where the guests would normally sit. Instead of the chatter of celebration, gun shots crack through the air. Glass is pockmarked with bullet holes. Only 50 yards from the wedding hall, according to Afghan soldiers, Taliban snipers hidden in civilian homes are firing night and day. A Taliban flag is visible on a nearby mountain top.

The winds killed at least two people, knocked out power, crushed grain silos, and flattened field after field of corn and soybeans. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has estimated that 10 million acres were damaged or destroyed by the derecho. That's roughly 43% of Iowa's 23.4 million acres that were seeded this spring with corn and soybeans, Radio Iowa reported.
__label__3 Mainstream media spin the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan to push for continued military occupationOPINIONSome coverage in mainstream print media and on cable networks of President Joe Biden’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan in August painted the plan as ill-advised or dangerous, ignoring 20 years of failed U.S. policy in the country. On July 8, Biden announced the decision to end military operations in Afghanistan by August 31, stating that even “one more year” of occupation would be a “recipe for fighting there indefinitely.” The U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, which has deployed troops inside the country since 2001, has been a disaster since the very beginning, resulting in...

As combines work their way north from the Southern Plains of Texas and Oklahoma, farmers and harvesting companies are having a hard time finding and keeping workers. Any delays in the harvest could send wheat prices higher and cause a scramble to secure supplies to make bread and pasta. The United...

__label__4 Examining Biden’s Farm Bankruptcy ClaimFACT CHECKJoe Biden claimed that farm bankruptcies increased last year “due largely to Trump’s unmitigated disaster of a tariff war.” International trade was a factor, but there were additional reasons that predate the trade war — such as years of relatively weak prices, declining incomes and rising farm debt, according to agricultural economists and government reports. “The bankruptcy wave this year has roots that go back several years,” Chad E. Hart, an associate professor of economics and crop markets specialist at Iowa State University, told us in an email. The former...

And among the countless problems created or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps one of the most urgent has been the strain on America’s meat supply chain.  With dozens of meat plants temporarily shut down, farmers across the country have had to euthanize tens of thousands of animals, and face the wrenching prospect of far larger culling. Meanwhile, U.S. weekly red meat production has dropped by as much...

Unfortunately, our political culture is dominated by a collection of incompetents and imbeciles for which nothing can pass without screw-ups and unnecessary outrage. Juneteenth—long celebrated in parts of America's black culture on June 19 but increasingly crossing over in the mainstream, as Reason's Zuri Davis detailed—marks the day in 1865 that the Union Army marched into Galveston, Texas, and freed roughly 250,000 slaves. Over the years, it has become a celebration of the snuffing out of chattel slavery within...

__label__2 On Memorial Day, Remember Skepticism Toward a Large, Standing MilitaryOPINIONIn recent years, it's become common to thank both retired and active-duty military personnel for their service – an expression met with various measures of appreciation or discomfort by recipients. The new custom is a step beyond the long-established sentiments embodied by Memorial Day, which acknowledges those who fell in combat in the ranks of a rare American institution that retains wide public confidence. While the thank-yous are well-intentioned, they represent a shift in attitude for a country that once distrusted anything resembling a powerful military. They also gloss over the costs—acknowledged on...
__label__4 President Trump's Executive Order on Meat ProcessingThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn April 28th, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at restoring the meat supply chain by classifying meat products under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and providing liability protection to meat processing plants that abide by CDC and OSHA guidelines. Trump noted that he had consulted with Tyson Foods before the order was written.Despite the headlines, the executive order itself does not actually order meat processing plants to do anything; rather, it incentivizes plants to reopen and gives Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue the authority to reopen plants "to promote the national defense."American meat production has fallen dramatically due to the pandemic, with meat industry companies considering keeping just 20% of plants open. Beef and pork production are already down 35% from this time last year, and chicken production is down 7% (WSJ). Since the executive order, seven more plants have shut down.As of May 6th, over 10,000 coronavirus cases have been linked to meat processing plants. At least 45 workers have died so far.

__label__5 Trump to sign order to keep meat-processing plants openPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would sign an executive order on food supply, as the U.S. was working with Tyson Foods during the coronavirus pandemic. The order, reports the Associated Press, is meant to stave off a shortage of chicken, pork and other meat on U.S. supermarket shelves because of the coronavirus. The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure to keep production plants open, the news organization reported. Speaking in the Oval Office with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump said...

Iran's chief negotiator Ali Baqeri Kani said that his government had agreed to meet in Vienna on 29 November. The discussions have been on hold since the election of Iran's new hard-line president in June. The US pulled out of the deal under President Donald Trump, but Washington has since said it could consider rejoining. The Biden administration said it will attend the Vienna meet, along with the remaining signatories,...
__label__3 US Olympian Gwen Berry raises a fist in protest as IOC relaxes rules on free speechThese Olympic Games are never far from the hint of a gesture or protest, a moment of free speech, an opportunity to make a statement. So it came as absolutely no surprise that U.S. hammer thrower Gwen Berry entered the Olympic Stadium Tuesday night by raising her right fist not once but twice, several seconds apart, to announce that she of all people would be taking advantage of the International Olympic Committee’s relaxed rules allowing freedom of speech prior to the start of play. “It was the same thing,” she said...
__label__2 Who Was St. Valentine? Separating The Man From The Myth.ANALYSISLike St. Patrick’s Day or Mardi Gras, 21st-century society has largely forgotten the religious origins of St. Valentine’s Day. While some may blame that on the overabundance of shameless commercialism, that’s only half the story. Truth be told, we know little about the revered Saint from whom we derive today’s festivities — a man whose ethos rivals that of St. Nicholas.
__label__4 Fast facts about international views of climate change as Biden attends UN COP26 conferenceDATAPresident Joe Biden is in Europe this weekend to attend COP26, a United Nations conference on climate change. The summit comes after a UN panel reported in August that urgent measures are needed to avoid catastrophic effects from climate change. Recent Pew Research Center surveys have documented how people around the world view the issue of climate change and international responses, as well as how they see policy decisions such as Biden’s decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Ahead of COP26, here’s a summary of key findings from these and other surveys:
__label__3 Hunter Biden’s prosecutor rejected moves that would have revealed probe earlierLast summer, federal officials in Delaware investigating Hunter Biden faced a dilemma. The probe had reached a point where prosecutors could have sought search warrants and issued a flurry of grand jury subpoenas. Some officials involved in the case wanted to do just that. Others urged caution. They advised Delaware’s U.S. Attorney, David Weiss, to avoid taking any actions that could alert the public to the existence of the case in the middle of a presidential election. “To his credit, he listened,” said a person involved in the discussions, reported...
__label__2 Alveda King: Uncle Taught That People 'Must Learn to Live Together'The late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught that people "must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or perish together as fools," and his message still holds true in a nation that has become increasingly divided, his niece, Alveda King, said Monday, on the federal holiday that honors her uncle. "I believe we can begin to learn to live together as brothers and sisters with personal accountability," King said on Fox News' "Fox and Friends." "We have to realize that we are one human race, not separate races."...
__label__5 World leaders reach landmark deal on a global corporate tax rateThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Friday announced a major breakthrough on corporate tax rates, after years of disagreement. The group of developed nations agreed to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. This marks a huge shift for smaller economies, such as the Republic of Ireland, which have attracted international firms — to a large extent — via a lower tax rate. “The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of...
__label__3 ‘This is freaking ridiculous’: Britney Spears inspires lawmakers to tackle toxic conservatorshipsThe Free Britney movement has a new fan base on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers with wildly different ideologies work to help a cause once dismissed as niche. The unusual groundswell began after an appeal in open court last month by 39-year-old pop star Britney Spears, who's fought to exit a legal guardianship she says has prevented her from driving with her boyfriend and forced her to stay on birth control. From Elizabeth Warren to Ted Cruz, prominent politicians are vowing to respond to Spears’ case and reviving a push for...
__label__2 Looking forward to 2021, with some wishesOPINIONSmall businesses and schools should remain open, and the election system should be fixed. Happy New Year! Here are some wishes for 2021: End the global pandemic. Just months ago, cynics said it would take a miracle to have a vaccine by the end of the year. Special thanks to President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and their team for pushing Operation Warp Speed. And major thanks to the scientists and other experts who gave us the vaccine. Keep our small businesses open. Stop the war...
__label__5 Biden to stress U.S. does not seek new Cold War in UN speechPresident Biden will use his first address before the UN General Assembly to lay out his vision for an era of "intensive diplomacy" with allies and "vigorous competition" with great powers — without a Cold War with China. Why it matters: Biden will take the podium in New York on Tuesday with his own international credibility in question after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. His administration also is struggling to build international momentum to fight climate change, the pandemic and rising global authoritarianism. What they're saying: Biden's speech "will center on the...

Around 1:46 a.m. local time the pilots lost their second engine and notified the Federal Aviation Administration that they were going down.
__label__1 Forget 2020 and just move on? No so fast. Do this firstOPINIONEach experience in our lives is meant to teach us something, to change us in some way. "2020." For the rest of our lives the mere mention of that fateful year will send a little chill down our spine. Every single person on this planet had life turned upside down and inside out by the coronavirus pandemic. Now that 2020 is in the rear-view mirror, I think we have to ask the question: Is 2020 a year to forget? I can imagine your answer is a resounding ‘yes!’ After all,...
__label__4 U.S. and China Reach Deal to Block Myanmar’s Junta From U.N.The United States and China have brokered an agreement that will effectively block Myanmar’s military rulers from addressing the United Nations’ General Assembly next week, according to diplomats, dealing a blow to the junta’s quest for international legitimacy after it took power in a coup earlier this year.  But the pact—which was hammered out during weeks of behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations—will require Myanmar’s defiant, still-serving U.N. ambassador who represented the previous government to hold his tongue during the high-level event, refraining from the tough rhetoric he deployed last year in denouncing the...
__label__3 Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prisonFor Janie Gullickson, rock bottom came both slowly and all at once. A long time drug and alcohol addict, Gullickson pushes back on the idea that one terrible day on the street leads to an epiphany and a climb back to normalcy. That’s what happens in movies, not real life. “I lived in the bottom for years,” says Gullickson, now 52. “For me and people like me, I laid there and wallowed in it for a long time.” But if she has to pick the lowest point – one that...
__label__1 The Content of Our ChristmasesANALYSISChristmas has a tendency to collect things, even things that don’t exactly go together. We celebrate the birth of a child in the Levant with christened winter traditions from Germany and Victorian morality fables. A 1990s pop songstress follows on a French carol. And even the phrases on my lips this time of year are a collection of nationalities. The “merry” in Merry Christmas was ditched for “Happy” in the U.K. in order to clean up its association with “merriment” — drinking booze and, one presumes, warming each other up....
__label__5 The Real Reason U.S. Allies Are Upset About AfghanistanANALYSISMy last column pushed back at the chorus of doomsayers who insist that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan—including the disorderly manner in which it played out—had done vast and lasting damage to America’s international position. No doubt some of these commentators genuinely believe their dire pronouncements, and the Islamic State-Khorasan attack on the Kabul airport is bound to intensify those feelings. Even so, I still find the hyperbole and over-the-top rhetoric remarkable. This week, I want to dig deeper and consider why so many people—and especially observers in Europe—appear to see this...
__label__3 QAnon's Mysterious Leader 'Q' Is Actually Multiple PeopleQAnon followers are certain that President Donald Trump won last month’s election. They are certain the pandemic is a fraud. They are certain that the Democrats are running a cannibalistic, Satanic child sex-trafficking ring. And they are certain that “the storm is coming.” These beliefs are rooted in one single fact: that an anonymous government insider known as Q has been posting cryptic messages for them to decipher since 2017. But a new textual analysis of Q’s 4,952 posts has found that there were two distinct authors of these so-called...
__label__1 I traveled for Christmas, and I'm not sorryOPINIONDemocrats and cable news anchors have spent the greater part of 2020 telling everyone to "stay home" in order to "stop the spread," especially during the holidays but — nah. I traveled to South Carolina — on an airplane! — ahead of Christmas to stay in a house that will have nine people inside. (Don't worry, it's a big house.) By traveling, I supposedly "put others at risk," but that's one of those nonsensical lies liberals have come up with so that they can do their favorite thing: feel morally...
__label__5 US Flights Out of Afghanistan Set to ‘Increase Significantly’ as Aug. 31 Deadline NearsThe U.S. Air Force has more than 230 cargo planes, tankers, and other aircraft now committed to the massive airlift underway in Kabul and evacuation flights are expected to “increase significantly” in the coming hours, as the U.S. races to get people out before Aug. 31, according to a defense official.  “It’s going to build, to increase significantly,” the official told Defense One on the condition they not be named. “You are going to see a significant uptick in the number of transport aircraft going in there and the volume and pace...
__label__2 Everything You Already Forgot About 2020ANALYSIS2020 has been the year that everything and nothing happened.  As Coronavirus forcibly took the wheel, we put aside nearly all plans and instead steered straight into a pandemic that broke our spirits and our brains. Meanwhile, we experienced both a nation-wide reckoning with systemic anti-Blackness and an election season that felt ripped out of a dystopian fiction. With those things to process, there wasn’t much more that our anxiety-ridden, quarantine-melted minds could entertain.  But the world did, in fact, go on. The ice caps continued melting. Celebrities...
__label__2 Yes, You Can Talk Politics at Christmas — Why Maybe You ShouldOPINIONHaving moved from polls to poultry just in time for Thanksgiving, we are still facing political unrest as more election lawsuits loom. So we ask ourselves the same question we asked last year (and the year before): should we ban political discussion around the holiday dinner table? Because many people are passionate about politics, you might not want to automatically ban partisan banter (or hats reflecting one's political leanings for that matter). Even if you anticipate a palette of colorful personalities around the table, there may still be a way...
__label__5 Confidential State Department Cable in July Warned of Afghanistan’s CollapseAbout two dozen State Department officials serving at the embassy in Kabul sent an internal memo to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and another top State Department official last month warning of the potential collapse of Kabul soon after the Aug. 31 troop withdrawal deadline, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the cable. The cable, sent via the State Department’s confidential dissent channel, warned of rapid territorial gains by the Taliban and the subsequent collapse of Afghan security forces, and offered recommendations on ways to mitigate the crisis...
__label__3 Hurricane Laura hits Gulf Coast as an “extremely dangerous” stormANALYSISThe storm barreled toward Texas and Louisiana during the 15th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The National Hurricane Center warned that Hurricane Laura will cause “life-threatening storm surge” reaching up to 40 miles inland and rising up to 20 feet as the storm made landfall in Texas and Louisiana. Laura reached the Gulf Coast after midnight on Thursday morning at an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 strength, with winds reaching 140 mph. After landfall, it weakened to a still dangerous Category 2 storm. During a Wednesday news conference, Louisiana Gov. John Bel...

In October, 36% responded that they still planned in-person gatherings, but that number dropped to 30% just before the holiday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discouraged Americans from Christmas and holiday travel due to the pandemic in a Dec. 2 telephone press conference.
__label__5 Was leaving Afghanistan 'the right way' ever possible?President Biden on Monday stood by his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but lamented the “gut-wrenching” events taking place as the Taliban swiftly regained control of the country. The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Within weeks, American forces had successfully disrupted al-Qaida operations and toppled the Taliban regime, which had harbored the terrorist group. But American troops maintained a presence in the country for the next 20 years in order to prop up the Afghan government and military, both of which fell...
__label__3 Federal prosecutors examining possible contacts between Giuliani and former Rep. Bob Livingston over Ukraine: SourcesA new name in the House impeachment inquiry, former Republican Rep. Bob Livingston, has surfaced in the ongoing investigation by federal prosecutors in New York into efforts by President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates in connection with Ukraine, multiple sources have told ABC News. More specifically, the sources said, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are looking into whether the former congressman had contact with Giuliani related to the push for the removal of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yavonovitch. Livingston, who played a...
__label__1 Cruz Spars With Homeland Security Secretary Over ‘Biden Cages’ For Migrant ChildrenSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) clashed Tuesday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over conditions for migrant children at border detention centers. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz referred to the border facilities housing migrant children as “Biden cages.” “How many children have been in the Biden cages in calendar year 2021?” Cruz asked Mayorkas. “Senator, I respectfully disagree with your use of the term ‘cages,'” Mayorkas responded. “Fine, you can disagree with it,” Cruz answered. “How many children have been in the Biden cages? I’ve been to the Biden cages, I’ve...
__label__4 Biden's speech on Afghanistan fact-checkedFACT CHECKIn his speech on Monday evening, President Joe Biden made a series of assertions about US policy in Afghanistan and the reasons behind his decision to withdraw forces from the country. BBC News has fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground. 'Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building.' President Biden stressed the purpose behind the US intervention in Afghanistan had "always been preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland" and "never supposed to...
__label__3 Rudy Giuliani butt-dials NBC reporter, heard discussing need for cash and trashing BidensLate in the night Oct. 16, Rudy Giuliani made a phone call to this reporter. The fact that Giuliani was reaching out wasn't remarkable. He and the reporter had spoken earlier that evening for a story about his ties to a fringe Iranian opposition group. But this call, it would soon become clear, wasn't a typical case of a source following up with a reporter. The call came in at 11:07 p.m. and went to voicemail; the reporter was asleep. The next morning, a message exactly three minutes long was...

__label__4 Kochworld comes to Biden's defense on AfghanistanPresident Biden is getting some unlikely backing for his Afghanistan troop withdrawal from a longtime nemesis: the Koch political network. Driving the news: Concerned Veterans for America, a foreign policy-focused arm of Charles Koch's Stand Together political and policy apparatus is coming to Biden's defense after the U.S. withdrawal handed control of the country to the Taliban this week. The Koch political network was one of the foremost antagonists of the Obama administration in which Biden served as vice president. What they're saying: "I think he made the right decision to withdraw,"...
__label__3 Congratulations, Nobel Committee, You Just Gave the Literature Prize to a Genocide ApologistSTOCKHOLM IS MORE than 1,500 miles from Sarajevo, and the war in Bosnia was halted in 1995, so there’s a lot of time and distance between the Swedes who just chose the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature and the nasty war that happened in the heart of the Balkans a generation ago. But that’s no excuse for the decision to give this year’s prize to Peter Handke, who denies that a well-documented genocide was committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia.
__label__2 DHS approved thousands of ineligible immigrants to work in U.S.: AuditThe Department of Homeland Security approved thousands of noncitizens to work in the U.S. even though its own system tried to flag them as probably ineligible, according to a new inspector general report that paints a grim picture of the government’s best tool for weeding out undocumented immigrant workers. The E-Verify system also confirmed work authorization for about 280,000 noncitizens in 2019 without actually matching them to photos online, opening an avenue for fraud that undocumented immigrants could exploit to take jobs, the Homeland Security inspector general said. Over the...
__label__4 Taliban press on, take 2 more Afghan provincial capitalsThe Taliban took control of two more provincial capitals in Afghanistan on Monday, officials said. Their fall marked the latest development in a weekslong, relentless Taliban offensive as American and NATO forces finalize their pullout from the war-torn country. The militants have ramped up their push across much of Afghanistan, turning their guns on provincial capitals after taking large swaths of land in the mostly rural countryside. On Monday they controlled five of the country’s 34 provincial capitals. At the same time, they have been waging an assassination campaign targeting...

__label__2 Suspected terrorists crossing border 'at a level we have never seen before,' outgoing Border Patrol chief saysUnprecedented numbers of known or suspected terrorists have crossed the southern border in recent months, the outgoing Border Patrol chief said. The head of the Border Patrol, Rodney Scott, told his 19,000 agents before retiring on Aug. 14 that their national security mission is paramount right now despite the Biden administration's focus on migrant families and children who are coming across the United States-Mexico boundary at record rates. “Over and over again, I see other people talk about our mission, your mission, and the context of it being immigration or the current...
__label__5 US to allow visitors from Hong Kong to stay for 18 monthsThousands of Hong Kong residents are to be offered a temporary "safe haven" in the US, President Joe Biden says. Mr Biden said that because Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by China, the US would allow visitors to stay for a period of 18 months. Thousands of Hong Kong residents already in the US may benefit. The UK has offered people from Hong Kong a path towards permanent residency following last year's adoption of China's security law for the territory. The law criminalises what are deemed to be acts...

The day before, a boy had been grazed by a stray bullet that pierced his bedroom wall while he was sleeping — one of more than 575 people injured by gunfire across Minneapolis this year. Why wasn’t Frey talking about the wounding of another child, demanded Angela Williams, a Black anti-violence activist who clutched a...

__label__5 Tense U.S.-China meeting ends, Beijing official says relations are in a ‘stalemate’Another high-level meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials — this time in the Chinese city of Tianjin, just outside of Beijing — concluded Monday with criticism from both sides. Before the talks even ended, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Monday the two countries’ relationship “is now in a stalemate and faces serious difficulties.” “Fundamentally, it is because some Americans portray China as an ‘imagined enemy,’” the ministry’s English-language release said. “We urge the United States...
__label__3 Why are conservatives throwing a tantrum about anti-racism? The George Floyd protests.OPINIONMany school districts across the country are in the grips of a full-blown moral panic, supposedly over something called "critical race theory" (CRT). Fox News has been blaring deranged propaganda about CRT for months. In Loudon County, Virginia (home to many Republican political professionals), angry conservatives deluged a recent school board meeting, and were so loud and disruptive that two were eventually arrested. Similar stories can be found in Maine, Texas, Pennsylvania, and many other states.

__label__3 Why Police Have Been Quitting in Droves in the Last YearAs protests surged across the country last year over the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police, Officer Lindsay C. Rose in Asheville, N.C., found her world capsized. Various friends and relatives had stopped speaking to her because she was a cop. During a protest in June around Police Headquarters, a demonstrator lobbed an explosive charge that set her pants on fire and scorched her legs. She said she was spit on. She was belittled. Members of the city’s gay community, an inclusive clan that had...

__label__5 Washington calls China’s tit-for-tat sanctions ‘baseless’Washington said punitive actions levelled by China on Friday against six individuals and an entity in the US are the latest in a string of “baseless” sanctions that demonstrate how Beijing punishes non-official players and shows its isolation from the global community. Beijing’s latest tit-for-tat salvo, in retaliation for earlier sanctions imposed by Washington on officials from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) over Hong Kong, is likely to increase tensions between the two nations ahead of an upcoming visit by US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to Tianjin.

__label__1 ICE gave $87M no-bid contract to business with Biden ties, raising conflict of interest questionsThe Biden administration did not solicit bids for a multimillion contract to house migrant families in hotels and instead gave the massive contract to an organization whose leadership has ties to the White House, including one official who was on the Biden transition team. In its rush to stand up facilities to hold families who come over the southern border illegally in rising numbers, the Biden administration signed a deal that a member of Congress and people with knowledge of the matter said presented a conflict of interest and wasted...

__label__3 How the George Floyd Uprising Was Framed for White EyesANALYSISIn 1963, Walter Gadsden, 15 years old, was attacked by a police dog during a protest on the streets of Birmingham, Alabama. The moment was captured by Bill Hudson of the Associated Press. His photograph was later said to have brought the world to the side of the civil rights movement—a grand claim but not an unreasonable one, given both the photo’s mass circulation and the meanings ascribed to it by white audiences. Gadsden was a “frail Negro,” in one description; full of “saintly calm,” in the words of Diane McWhorter,...

Why it matters: In a statement, the company said it's making these changes because it's facing "a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China." Catch up quick: The news comes weeks after Axios China Reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian reported that LinkedIn blocked the profiles of several U.S. journalists from the company's China-based platform, citing "prohibited content." Allen-Ebrahimian posed questions to the tech giant about the...
__label__3 District Attorney says deputies who fatally shot Andrew Brown Jr. were justifiedDistrict Attorney Andrew Womble said Tuesday that the deputies who fatally shot Andrew Brown Jr. last month were justified in using deadly force, saying Brown "recklessly" drove at the officers on scene while trying to flee arrest. "Mr. Brown's death, while tragic, was justified because Mr. Brown's actions caused three deputies to reasonably believe it was necessary to use deadly force to protect themselves and others," Womble said. In response, attorneys for the family of Brown, a 42-year-old Black man, called the decision not to charge the officers an...

Mayorkas suggested shuffling thousands of immigration agents into investigative roles that would focus on criminal activity other than immigration violations, according to The Washington Times. “This is an administrative abolishment of ICE as we currently know it,” an anonymous source told the Times in a Sunday report....

__label__2 It’s Time to Get the National Guard Off of Capitol HillANALYSISIn the aftermath of January 6, Capitol Hill was transformed essentially into a military installation, surrounded by high razor-wire fencing, patrolled by National Guardsmen and other security forces, and accessible only via checkpoints. These were sold as short-term measures, only to last through the inauguration and impeachment. Well, impeachment has come and gone, but it doesn’t seem as if the Capitol area will look much different anytime soon. To be sure, there are fewer troops: On Inauguration Day, there were some 25,000. Now it’s around 6,000. But already there have...

Is it grounds for appeal?A juror in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, participated in last summer's March on Washington, a move that is coming under scrutiny after Chauvin's attorney requested a new trial on several grounds, including juror misconduct. The attorney, Eric Nelson, did not refer to the juror's participation in the march in his request for a new trial Tuesday.

__label__4 At police lines, not all journalists are created equalOPINIONFor a lot of journalism’s history, BIPOC experiences have been told through a white lens. Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...

Even the police chief spoke out against Chauvin’s use of force. But on the day that Floyd was killed, the Minneapolis Police Department told a much different story about the encounter that sparked a summer of protests over police brutality. "Man Dies after Medical Incident During Police Interaction," said the May 25, 2020, statement.

__label__4 YouTube says content policing is good for businessWhile critics allege YouTube puts profits over public safety, product head Neal Mohan insists that the Google-owned video site is working to be a better content moderator, in part because it is good for business. Why it matters: Users spend billions of hours watching videos on YouTube, and the site's content recommendations shape how that time is spent. Facebook and Twitter tend to get more attention on content moderation, but YouTube remains an equally important information battleground. Driving the news: YouTube is announcing Monday that it now has two million people in...

__label__2 The Problem in Portland Isn’t the Law; It’s the LawlessnessANALYSISDespite some occasional looting, chaos, property damage, trespassing, rioting, graffiti, assaults, arson, and general mayhem, the media consistently assures us that Antifa “protesters” are “largely peaceful.” And since the majority of buildings in Portland, Seattle, and Denver haven’t been looted yet, who am I to argue? Of course, it takes only a sliver of the population to transform downtowns into a mess and create quality-of-life issues for thousands of law-abiding citizens. And the mayors who surrender parts of their cities to left-wing “protesters” are tacitly endorsing lawlessness themselves. There’s little...

District of Columbia District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich ruled Friday that the moratorium, which prohibits landlords from evicting low-income tenants who cannot afford their rent, could be enforced since a Supreme Court majority technically ruled it was constitutional.

__label__3 The fourth wave of COVID-19 cases is here. Will we escape the UK's fate? It's too soon to know.A doubling of COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks suggests the United States has entered a fourth wave of the pandemic. No one knows what the next month or two will bring, but the example of the United Kingdom suggests the infection rate could get quite high, while hospitalizations and deaths stay relatively low. Instead of the virus raging through entire communities, it is expected to target the unvaccinated, including children, and if rates are high enough, also the most vulnerable of the vaccinated – the elderly and the immunocompromised. "Since the majority...
__label__1 Supreme Court Maintains CDC's Pandemic-Related Residential Eviction BanThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ban on residential evictions imposed last year to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent homelessness during the pandemic, dealing a setback to landlords who had challenged the policy. The justices declined a request made by a group of landlords to allow a federal judge's decision to block the eviction moratorium to go into effect nationwide while litigation in the dispute continues. The moratorium is due to expire on July 31.

Pew Research Center has tracked these developments through surveys, demographic analyses and other research. As the 2010s draw to a close, here are key ways the country looks different from 10 years ago: From smartphones to social media, tech use has become the norm.

__label__3 The online safety bill will show just how blurred the boundaries of free speech areOPINIONConsequences matter. If there was one clear message from football’s temporary boycott of social media earlier this month, in protest at the torrent of online hate experienced disproportionately by black players, that was it. The former England striker Ian Wright has said that he’d almost given up reporting the vile stuff he receives daily because nothing ever seemed to happen to the perpetrators. “It makes you feel very dehumanised. You feel like there’s nothing you can do, you’re helpless,” he said. So two cheers, at least, for the inclusion in...
__label__2 Critics Warned the Largest Tax Increase in San Francisco History Would Be Ill-Spent. It's Now Funding $60,000 Tents for the Homeless.ANALYSISWhen San Francisco voters were considering a 2018 ballot measure that would impose the largest tax increase in city history to fund homelessness services, critics warned that the initiative's spending plan was vague and unaccountable. Now, a chunk of that money is going to fund some very expensive tents. On Wednesday, staff for the city's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing went before the Board of Supervisors' Budget and Appropriations Committee to request $20 million over the next two fiscal years to continue operating six "safe sleeping" tent encampments.  This safe...
__label__4 AP-NORC/USAFacts Poll: Social media a political news paradoxPROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (AP) — It’s one of America’s leading sources for news about the government, yet also among the least trusted. Social media, a new poll finds, is America’s political news paradox. Julie Ferguson, an occupational therapist in central Washington state, remembers getting TV news from just a handful of networks. “I grew up watching Walter Cronkite,” she said. Today, she sees more political news on social media than anywhere else. She doesn’t trust it, but worries many others do. “The information they’re getting, who knows where it’s coming...
__label__3 How the UK found the first effective Covid-19 treatment — and saved a million livesANALYSISThe United Kingdom is not a pandemic success story. But its massive Covid-19 trials program is. Peter Horby couldn’t believe his eyes. He’d just gotten his first glimpse of new data from the United Kingdom’s Recovery Trial, an experiment enrolling tens of thousands of patients at dozens of hospitals for clinical trials investigating Covid-19 therapies. Horby and his Oxford University colleague Martin Landray had dreamed up the trial program in March 2020. Nearly three months later, more than 35,000 people were dead in the UK (and more than 100,000 in...

__label__3 Why is Archie not a prince? Fact-checking prince protocol after Meghan and Harry’s Oprah interviewFACT CHECKPrince Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey left many observers of the British royal family puzzling over one question: Why doesn’t their son Archie have the title of prince? Meghan, who married Harry in 2018, said she was shocked to discover while she was pregnant that Archie would not get the title of prince or any associated security.  "They were saying they didn't want him to be a prince or a princess — not knowing what the gender would be — which would be different from protocol," Meghan...

__label__3 Without Apple and Google, the UK’s contact-tracing app is in troubleCountries around the world are scrambling to create contact-tracing apps that will help track the spread of COVID-19. But a beta app launched by the UK this week shows the huge challenges they face and, crucially, the difficulty in designing an effective app without the help of the tech giants that make our phones. The UK is one of the few countries that has chosen to create a contact-tracing app that is incompatible with the contact-tracing API currently being developed by Google and Apple. Instead of decentralizing the data across...

__label__3 UK sued for approving Europe’s biggest gas power stationThe UK government is being sued for approving a large new gas-fired power plant, overruling the climate change objections of its own planning authority. The plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, would become the biggest gas power station in Europe and could produce 75% of the UK’s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who have brought the judicial review. The planning inspectorate recommended to ministers that the 3.6GW gas plant was to be refused permission because it “would undermine the government’s commitment,...

"If President Trump is not impeached, the American people might get a say in who is president," Schiff said gravely. "We simply can't allow that to happen. We must diligently defend our electoral process against...
__label__5 FACT CHECK: Did Harry Truman Really Try To Buy Greenland Back In The Day?President Trump defended the idea of buying Greenland — derided by critics within the United States and rejected by Denmark, which controls it — in part by saying the idea first came from President Harry Truman. Is that so? The short answer: Yes — but it's complicated. The long answer: Trump's acknowledgment that he really has been talking about the United States buying Greenland — and that he was offended when Denmark's prime minister called the idea "absurd" — were the jaw-dropping coda from an Aug. 16 report in The...

Tells Israeli Crowd ‘I’d Rather Be In Auschwitz Than New York City’Before his stunning downfall, comedian Louis C.K. was known to joke about anything and everything, no matter how taboo. He’s back, and he’s picked up right where he left off. “I’d rather be in Auschwitz than New York City,” he joked in a show at a venue near Tel Aviv, Israel. “I mean now, not when it was open.” The 52-year-old comedian, whose paternal grandfather was Jewish, delivered the line Thanksgiving night performance, prompting laughter and applause from the audience, the New York Post reported.
__label__4 What happens when protesters take over for the police?ANALYSISWhen Michael McQuarrie entered the George Floyd Square autonomous zone for the first time last year, he felt as if he was entering a freer, friendlier, and, in some ways, edgier America. To some, the neighborhood had become the “Free State of George Floyd.” To him and many there, it proved more broadly that a community can not only function, but thrive, without police authority: that physical autonomy empowers citizens. And then there were the gun shots. “Policing in Black and trans communities has been so brutal over 30, 40...

__label__1 Cruz Spars With Homeland Security Secretary Over ‘Biden Cages’ For Migrant ChildrenSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) clashed Tuesday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over conditions for migrant children at border detention centers. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz referred to the border facilities housing migrant children as “Biden cages.” “How many children have been in the Biden cages in calendar year 2021?” Cruz asked Mayorkas. “Senator, I respectfully disagree with your use of the term ‘cages,'” Mayorkas responded. “Fine, you can disagree with it,” Cruz answered. “How many children have been in the Biden cages?

__label__3 BLM and Floyd protests were largely peaceful, data confirmsOver the past year anti-racism protests have swept the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of now-convicted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Marches and protests spanned every U.S. state – a massive expression of public concern but also a movement perceived by some to be violent.  In January Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona said Black Lives Matter “burns and loots,” for example. And in a Morning Consult poll 13 months ago, 42% of Americans said most protesters are trying to incite violence or destroy property. A...

__label__2 George Floyd death: How US police are trying to win back trustIt must be hard being a police officer in America, especially after the death of George Floyd. Damn right too, some would argue, given the shocking video of his last moments alive. Patrol woman Brittany Richardson is 34 and a 12-year veteran. She's now with the Ferguson Police Department, a suburb of St Louis in Missouri, and was at home with her wife and two children when she first saw the images of Derek Chauvin's knee on Mr Floyd's neck. "There were so many videos of police engaged in the...
__label__1 Black Britons Know Why Meghan Markle Wants OutOPINIONThe British press has succeeded in its apparent project of hounding Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, out of Britain. The part it perhaps didn’t bargain for, however, is the loss of Prince Harry — a much loved Royal and a key part of the family’s global brand — along with her. In a statement released this week, the couple said they want to “carve out a progressive new role” within the royal family and will “step back as ‘senior’ members, and work to become financially independent.” The British press...
__label__4 Border crossings by Haitian migrants plunged in October, CBP data showThe number of Haitian migrants attempting to cross into the United States fell by more than 90 percent in October after the Biden administration aggressively ramped up its use of deportation flights, according to preliminary U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Washington Post. CBP figures show about 1,000 Haitians were taken into custody along the Mexico border last month, down from 17,638 in September, when huge crowds waded across the Rio Grande to a makeshift camp in Del Rio, Tex., creating a humanitarian and political crisis for...
__label__3 1 verdict, then 6 police killings across America in 24 hoursEven as the Derek Chauvin case was fresh in memory — the reading of the verdict in a Minneapolis courtroom, the shackling of the former police officer, the jubilation at what many saw as justice in the death of George Floyd — even then, blood flowed on America’s streets. And even then, some of that blood was shed at the hands of law enforcement. At least six people were fatally shot by officers across the United States in the 24 hours after jurors reached a verdict in the murder case...

__label__3 Is the Chauvin verdict a turning point for U.S. policing?Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd by pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck during an arrest last May, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter on Tuesday. “Today, we are able to breathe again,” Floyd’s brother Philonise told reporters after the verdict was announced. His sentiments were echoed in a wave of statements from politicians, celebrities and racial justice advocates who noted how exceedingly rare it is for police officers to be convicted for killing people while on duty. Video footage taken by a bystander...
__label__2 Prince Andrew, Disgraced by His Friendship With Jeffrey Epstein, is Left Out in The Christmas ColdPrince Andrew was shunned by the royal family today.

__label__5 Venezuelans eclipse Central Americans in Border Patrol custody, highlighting scale of crisisMore Venezuelans were in the custody of the Border Patrol at the end of October than any other nationality of migrants, an indication of the extremely high numbers of displaced South Americans are flocking to the United States amid the Biden administration’s lax border policies. Never before have Venezuelans arrived at the border at the current rates. Usually, Mexico or Central American nations top the list of countries with the most citizens in federal custody at the border. The mass arrival of migrants from other, more remote countries is an indication that...
__label__3 Can Derek Chauvin Appeal Guilty Verdict?Former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on all three counts against him Tuesday, closing this chapter of the case which began with George Floyd's May 25, 2020, death, but beginning the sentencing and appeals portions of the process. Because Chauvin was not charged with first-degree murder, he is eligible for appeal, which must be filed by his defense attorneys within 90 days of Tuesday's jury verdict. The Minneapolis jury found Chauvin guilty on count one, unintentional second-degree murder, Count two, third-degree murder, perpetrating an eminently dangerous act, and...
__label__2 The Fight for Socialism in Britain Will ContinueWhile campaigning in nearly fifty seats up and down the country over the course of this campaign, one thing has become very obvious to me: an almost unbridgeable gulf has emerged between the different parts of the United Kingdom. Today, we are the most regionally unequal of all the advanced economies, bar Ireland and Slovakia. London is an international megacity, a playground for wealthy elites from all over the world, while some regions of the UK have similar levels of output to parts of Eastern Europe. The root causes are...
__label__5 House GOP introducing bill to block reported Biden plan to pay illegal immigrants up to $450KRepublicans in the House on Thursday will introduce a bill to block a reported plan by the Biden administration to pay millions of dollars to illegal immigrants separated under the Trump administration – as President Biden has sought to dismiss the reports. Rep. Tom McClintock, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, will introduce the Illegal Immigration Payoff Prohibition Act, which amends 18 USC 2414 – which gives the attorney general the authority to enter settlement agreements. The bill would block the attorney general from making any settlement payments...

Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said the resignations came after the city council passed a resolution to dismiss both the chief, Tim Gannon, and the officer who shot Wright, Kim Potter. Wright was shot on Sunday after being pulled over for what police said was an expired car registration. Officers then discovered...
__label__1 Victory for Boris Johnson’s all-new ToriesThe Conservatives’ capture of the north points to a realignment in British politics. Will it last? BRITAIN’S ELECTION on December 12th was the most unpredictable in years—yet in the end the result was crushingly one-sided. As we went to press the next morning, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party was heading for a majority of well over 70, the largest Tory margin since the days of Margaret Thatcher. Labour, meanwhile, was expecting its worst result since the 1930s. Mr Johnson, who diced with the possibility of being one of Britain’s shortest-serving prime...

Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked the president as he rode down an escalator at the G20 summit.  Instead of responding, Biden gave a blank stare and scratched his head.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the payments could total...
__label__3 Kentucky Law Limits Use Of No-Knock Warrants, A Year After Breonna Taylor's KillingKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill into law limiting the use of no-knock warrants on Friday, just over a year after the police killing of Breonna Taylor that sparked calls for change in Louisville and beyond. The 26-year-old EMT was fatally shot in March 2020 during a botched police raid on her home, and her name has since become a rallying cry at protests demanding police reform and racial justice. State Sen. Reggie Thomas, who co-sponsored the bill, described it at the signing ceremony as "a step in the...
__label__2 Early Polls Predict Landslide Victory for Britain’s Conservative Party, Prime Minister Boris JohnsonEARLY EXIT POLLING suggests that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party have won a landslide reelection in a race dominated by the quagmire over the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. The results signal that Johnson's vow to "get Brexit done" resonated with voters tired of the dithering over the U.K.'s departure from the bloc. The U.K. is set to leave the EU on Jan. 31 and a robust Conservative majority in Parliament would clear the way for Johnson to move quickly on Brexit. The first batches...

On a recent afternoon, Irma Burns stood beside the makeshift memorial with phone in hand, taking photos of the image of her dead son. Mr. Clark’s fatal shooting six years ago ignited an 18-day protest outside the 4th Precinct police station two blocks away. The upheaval laid bare long-running tensions between the city’s communities of color and its mostly white police force...
__label__1 The Last Days of the BBC?As Britain faces a crucial general election, its second in two years, one of its most venerable institutions has been busy demolishing what’s left of its reputation. The BBC has long been admired internationally for its well-resourced drama and documentary programs, and respected for the professionalism of its journalism. But its hollowing out by a series of neoliberal governments looks to have finally caught up with the once august institution. Whatever the merits of the BBC’s educational and cultural output — a large proportion of which anyway come from private...

__label__3 Journalists don’t always cover anti-racism protests as fairly as they think they doANALYSISAmid the so-called racial reckoning following the murder of George Floyd and the resulting wave of racial justice protests in 2020, newsrooms across the country began to consider their role in perpetuating racial inequities. In December, The Kansas City Star apologized for its racist coverage of the Black community, which robbed Black Kansas Citians of “opportunity, dignity, justice and recognition.” In January, the Boston Globe announced a “Fresh Start” initiative aimed at correcting its crime coverage that has particularly impacted communities of color. As the journalism industry commits to doing...
__label__1 What to Know About Prince Andrew, the Royal at the Center of the Epstein ScandalPrince Andrew, the Duke of York, has found himself at the center of controversy surrounding his relationship with disgraced American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in an apparent suicide in a New York City federal jail in August.

Although it is not the...
__label__5 Militia Moves Into Texas Border County to Deter Illegal ImmigrationFor months, Texas ranchers have dealt with a relentless stream of illegal aliens traversing their property, cutting fences, breaking into their homes, and threatening them. Their patience is wearing thin. Rural Kinney County, where Brackettville sits, has become a major thoroughfare for illegal immigrants trying to avoid law enforcement. The county shares just 16 miles of international border with Mexico, but sits between Del Rio and Eagle Pass—two major illegal border-crossing areas in Texas. The Kinney sheriff’s stable of six full-time deputies has been beefed up by constables and deputies from Galveston,...
__label__3 Elijah McClain: ‘No legal basis’ for detention that led to deathAn independent report in Colorado has said that officers involved in the death of a young black man in police custody had no legal standing to stop, frisk and detain him. Elijah McClain died in 2019 in the city of Aurora, three days after being put in a chokehold and injected with ketamine. A panel of outside experts faulted the police officers for stopping the 23-year-old and the paramedics for giving him too much ketamine without a proper examination. Officers were initially cleared of wrongdoing, but the case sparked outrage...
__label__1 Gun Violence in America Could Soon Get WorseOPINIONOver the past decade, amid rising mass shootings and fierce debate over America’s gun laws, the claim that “nothing ever changes” became a political cliché. The frustration was aimed in particular at the federal government—foremost at the failure by Congress to mandate a stronger and more comprehensive background-check system for gun buyers, a policy with long-standing bipartisan support among Americans, including gun owners. Much has changed in recent years, in fact, at the state and local levels, where governments adopted hundreds of regulations either tightening or loosening restrictions on firearms, a mix defined largely along partisan...

Post employees last week saw two planes land at the Westchester County Airport, where the flights arrived at 10:49 p.m. Wednesday and 9:52 p.m. Friday. Most of the passengers who exited...

It stayed high, at 16%, in July but subsequently settled into the...
__label__2 America can’t fix policing without fixing the country’s gun problemOPINIONI started reporting this article with a simple question: What would it look like to build a better police department from the ground up? Police in the US, after all, are more likely to shoot and kill someone than their peers around the developed world, and disproportionately the victims are Black Americans. Meanwhile, serious crimes are often unsolved — with almost half of murders in 2020 going uncleared. So I asked a dozen experts, focused on criminal justice, what could be done about this to build better police departments. They gave me a lot of different answers,...
__label__5 Biden Admin Will Reinstate Tump’s Remain In Mexico Policy In NovemberThe Biden administration is planning to reinstate former President Donald Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy in November, CBS News reported on Friday. A federal judge ordered the Biden administration to reinstate the policy in August after requests by the Texas and Missouri attorneys general, according to CBS News. The Biden administration criticized the “Remain in Mexico” policy that left 70,000 migrants who weren’t from Mexico to wait in Mexican border towns until their U.S. asylum hearings. The Biden administration is now legally required to abide by the judge’s August order “in good faith,”...

__label__1 The NRA had a very good day in the Supreme CourtOPINIONThe biggest surprise in Wednesday morning’s arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. (NYSRPA) v. Bruen, a major Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court, is that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared open to many of New York state’s arguments defending its restrictions on where individuals may carry a gun. Even if Barrett does side with New York, however, her vote is unlikely to matter. Four justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — left little doubt that they will read the Second...
__label__5 How Biden Has Misled Americans About The Situation At The Southern BorderANALYSISPresident Joe Biden and his administration have misled Americans about the situation at the southern border multiple times since taking office, according to Customs and Border Protection data and various media reports. Biden refused to call the influx of migrants at the southern border a “crisis” in April. He has called it a seasonal surge that happens “every single solitary year.” Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data suggested otherwise. In March of this year, CBP saw a 400% increase when compared to the same period in 2020. Record breaking apprehensions continued throughout the spring and...

__label__2 Majority of Supreme Court appears to think N.Y. gun law is too restrictiveA majority of Supreme Court justices indicated Wednesday that they believe Americans generally have a right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense and that a New York law requiring special justification for getting such a permit is too restrictive. But it was unclear from a two-hour argument in the case how much more the court was willing to do to clarify the Second Amendment. Several expressed concern about allowing those with concealed weapons in sensitive areas, such as stadiums, crowded public events or places were alcohol is...
__label__5 U.S. Officials Quietly Preparing For ‘350,000 to 400,000’ Migrant Encounters At Mexico Border In October: ReportThe Biden administration’s Department of Homeland Security is quietly gearing up for a surge of “350,000 to 400,000” migrants in the month of October, according to a report from NBC News, and believe the border could see a huge influx of activity if the Title 42 COVID restriction on asylum lifts on Friday. Title 42, instituted during the Trump administration, allows the federal government to “expel” immigrants, including asylum seekers, back to their home country without a hearing, over concerns that they could contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

__label__2 The Supreme Court case that could gut America’s gun laws, explainedOPINIONFor nearly all its history, the Supreme Court kept its distance from gun policy. Now it’s about to decide a case that could radically reduce the government’s power to regulate guns. The Second Amendment states explicitly that it exists to protect “a well regulated Militia,” and until fairly recently, the Court took these four words very seriously. As a unanimous Court explained in United States v. Miller (1939), the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias, and the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that...

But rising crime and the problems that have come with it — like one of Atlanta’s wealthiest districts trying to secede from the city — pushed him out of mayoral retirement and into an already crowded race. Homicides and shootings are up and the number of cops is down in cities from Atlanta to Seattle. Crime, as a result, is dominating the discourse in mayoral races — driving candidates to talk about beefing up police patrols and...

The unanimous vote comes after the city of Del Rio, which is located in Val Verde County, saw a massive surge of mostly Haitians illegally enter the United States, overwhelming Border Patrol and local law enforcement.

"Rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them," Biden said June 23. "There has always been the ability to limit — rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it." And, Biden said,...

__label__5 Schiff's Defense of Impeachment Comes From....British HistoryLawyers for former President Trump will challenge the constitutionality of impeaching a private citizen in the trial that is set to begin Tuesday. “The Senate must summarily reject this brazen political act,” his attorneys wrote in a legal brief, calling the single impeachment article “unconstitutional for a variety of reasons, any of which alone would be grounds for immediate dismissal.” But according to Rep. Adam Schiff, there is precedent for late impeachment. It’s just in…British history.  In a thread on Twitter, the former lead impeachment manager attempted to make...
__label__2 Britain put up a statue of its first female MP. You’ll definitely believe what happened next.ANALYSISLATE LAST MONTH, IN THE MIDST of divisive national elections in Britain, officials from across the political spectrum took a private train to Plymouth, in southwest England, on a rare mission of comity.  They went to the unveiling of a statue of Nancy Astor, the first woman to sit in Britain’s Parliament, on the centenary of her election to represent Plymouth. The statue, like the train ride, was a bipartisan endeavor. Liz Truss—a Conservative, like Astor—was on board the train, as was Shami Chakrabarti, a senior figure in the...
__label__1 McKinsey Never Told the FDA It Was Working for Opioid Makers While Also Working for the AgencySince 2008, McKinsey & Company has regularly advised the Food and Drug Administration’s drug-regulation division, according to agency records. The consulting giant has had its hand in a range of important FDA projects, from revamping drug-approval processes to implementing new tools for monitoring the pharmaceutical industry. During that same decade-plus span, as emerged in 2019, McKinsey counted among its clients many of the country’s biggest drug companies — not least those responsible for making, distributing and selling the opioids that have ravaged communities across the United States, such as Purdue...
__label__5 Trump's lawyers warn of Republican retaliation, impeachment as political weaponThe historic second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump will open in the Senate on Tuesday, with his attorneys saying Mr. Trump is blameless for the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and accusing Democrats of exploiting the deadly riot for partisan gain. Defense attorneys David Schoen and Bruce Castor said in a legal brief filed Monday that the impeachment trial is an act of “political theater” by Democrats who are still in the grips of “Trump derangement syndrome,” even though Mr. Trump left office on Jan. 20. Mr. Trump’s...
__label__3 Brexit bill to rule out extension to transition periodThe government is to add a new clause to the Brexit bill to rule out any extension to the transition period beyond the end of next year. The post-Brexit transition period - due to conclude in December 2020 - can currently be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years. But an amended Withdrawal Agreement Bill the Commons is set to vote on this week would rule out any extension. Critics say this raises the chance of leaving the EU without a trade deal. But senior Cabinet Minister Michael...
__label__2 We Need to Shrink Big Pharma Until It’s Small Enough to Drown in a BathtubOPINIONNow that George W. Bush is back in the news with his attacks on Trumpist insurrectionists, it might be worth reviving one of the great lines of his presidency. After the September 11 attack, when Bush decided to go after not just the terrorists who planned the hijackings, but all sorts of people around the world he didn’t like, he lumped them together as “evildoers.” That may not be the most eloquent phrase, but it works well as a description of the modern pharmaceutical industry. Some may find this description...
__label__4 Trump lawyers rail against impeachment trial as ‘political theater’ on eve of proceedingsLawyers for former President Trump on Monday submitted a brief saying the Democrats' effort to convict the president in an impeachment trial after he's left office is "political theater," and that the trial is outside of the Senate's constitutional authority.  "Instead of acting to heal the nation, or at the very least focusing on prosecuting the lawbreakers who stormed the Capitol, the Speaker of the House and her allies have tried to callously harness the chaos of the moment for their own political gain," the brief says.

__label__1 Why Democrats desperately need to cut prescription drug pricesANALYSISDemocrats can’t do much on health care if they don’t cut prescription drug costs. Democrats had big dreams for health care reform this year. In the forthcoming budget reconciliation bill, they planned to cover millions of uninsured people and offer dental and vision benefits to people on Medicare, while also cutting prescription drug costs. But now those grand ambitions are crashing against the hard reality of legislating with incredibly narrow margins in Congress. If only a few members balk at what the Biden White House and Democratic leaders want to do, that could be enough to doom...
__label__4 Impeachment Managers Call Trump Riot Incitement ‘Most Grievous Constitutional Crime Ever Committed by a President’House impeachment managers released a memo on Monday rebutting the Trump legal team’s claim that an impeachment trial would be unconstitutional.The House voted to impeach former President Trump on January 13 for “incitement of insurrection,” accusing the former president of encouraging a mob of his supporters to amass at the Capitol on January 6 to prevent lawmakers from certifying President Biden’s electoral college win. The mob breached the building and forced lawmakers to evacuate, and five people died in the ensuing riot and its aftermath.

Speaking in Downing Street, he said he would seek to repay the trust placed in him by Labour supporters who had voted Conservative for the first time. He said he would not ignore those who opposed Brexit as he builds with Europe a partnership "of sovereign equals". He urged the country to unite and end years of wrangling. Mr Johnson has been returned to power with a...
__label__1 Medicare Expansion Clashes With Health Care for the Poor as Budget Bill ShrinksUnder pressure to cut the bill’s cost, Democrats disagree over whether to offer more benefits to older Americans or to cover more of the working poor. Democrats are facing tough moral and political decisions over how to pursue their century-old dream of universal health care now that their ambitious $3.5 trillion social safety net bill will almost certainly have to be trimmed back. As they try to reduce the bill’s cost, members of the party disagree over whether to prioritize expanding coverage to more poor adults in states whose leaders have refused to...
__label__4 Evidence Mounts that Capitol Breach Was Pre-Planned, Eroding Incitement Allegation in Trump Impeachment TrialAs former President Donald Trump’s Tuesday impeachment trial approaches, there is a growing body of evidence in criminal complaints and affidavits that the Jan. 6 Capitol breach had been pre-planned, undercutting the allegation leveled against Trump that he is guilty of “incitement to insurrection.” A number of FBI affidavits filed in support of various charges—including conspiracy—against accused participants in the Capitol breach show evidence of pre-planning, reinforcing one of the arguments made by critics of the impeachment trial against Trump, namely that participants couldn’t have been incited by the president...

But after the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on Alec Baldwin’s film “Rust,” Johnson is pledging to stop using real firearms on all projects that are produced by his...

__label__5 Trump's defense team will show clips of Democrats urging violence in 2020Former President Donald Trump‘s defense at his Senate impeachment trial will include videos of Democrats encouraging violence, one of his lawyers said Friday. The clips would counter videos that Democrats likely will show of the riot at Capitol and Mr. Trump‘s fiery speech at a rally shortly before the attack on Jan. 6, which Mr. Trump stands accused of inciting. Trump lawyer Bruce Castor told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham “you can count on that” when asked about using video montage of Democratic members of Congress calling for violence against Trump...

Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...

Then I asked about how wokeness affects his teaching. I had no idea of the man’s politics, but I would bet the farm that he is a liberal, given that his academic field skews heavily to the left. He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...

There were 98 deaths that resulted from unintentional shootings by children from March through December 2019 compared to 128 over that same period in 2020, research by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety shows. And the trend continues to worsen during the pandemic, the groups says. So far, in 2021 there have been at least 259 unintentional shootings by children, resulting in 104 deaths and 168...
__label__1 J&J vaccine booster shot raises antibody levels 9-fold, company saysIn the midst of a delta variant surge, a new study finds that giving a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot six months after primary vaccination results in a nine-fold increase of a crucial antibody response, according to a company press release. Meanwhile, a prior study found that people vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine still had a durable immune response at least eight months later, even without a booster. Collectively, the findings could help inform the U.S. government's recommendations about booster shots for the 14 million people who received the...

We wouldn’t have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent....
__label__3 U.S. Justice Department says Missouri state gun law is unconstitutionalPresident Joe Biden's Justice Department is stepping up its fight against a new state law in Missouri that aims to invalidate many federal gun regulations, saying the measure has impeded law enforcement efforts to work with state and local police and is also unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a statement of interest in an ongoing lawsuit in Cole County, Missouri, saying the state's Second Amendment Preservation Act, also known as "HB85," should be declared unconstitutional and that the court should issue a injunction barring its enforcement. "HB85 is...
__label__1 These 8 states make up half of US Covid-19 hospitalizations. And the surge among the unvaccinated is overwhelming health care workersANALYSISAs experts race to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 by encouraging vaccinations and mask wearing, hospital systems in a handful of states are now straining to keep up with the surge. Eight states, many of which have lagged the national average for vaccinations, have Covid-19 patients that account for at least 15% of their overall hospitalizations: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. Of all Covid-19 hospitalizations, these eight states' combined totals make up...
__label__5 Asian Americans Disprove CRTOPINIONAccording to the illiberal race-hustlers among us, America is a thoroughly racist nation where you only succeed if (and because) you are white. Therefore, we need government to coercively redistribute wealth and allocate important positions by racial quotas. Only through such measures can we attain “equity.” That theory collapses when examined with any care. A person’s race or ancestry has nothing to do with his success or failure in life. In today’s Martin Center article, Kenny Xu demolishes critical race theory by pointing out that Asian Americans have enjoyed great success...
__label__3 Mexico Sues US Gunmakers Over Arms TraffickingMexico said it filed a lawsuit against major US gunmakers in a Boston court on Wednesday over illegal cross-border arms flows that it blamed for fueling rampant drug-related violence. The Latin American nation, which has long faced pressure from the United States to curb narcotics smuggling, wants its neighbor to crack down on firearms trafficking in the other direction. This kind of legal action is unprecedented for the Mexican government and has the backing of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a news conference. "We are...

Vaccination Rates Continue to Rise.ANALYSISEven as the highly transmissible Delta variant rampages through the country, there’s a bit of good news: As of last week, more people in the United States are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 than unvaccinated. Vaccination rates are finally on a rise again after a slump in the summer months of June and July. The Delta variant has been causing a surge in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the country, and public health experts have observed that areas with high vaccination rates are better protected than areas where few people are...

__label__3 A new political tone over gun violence?As shootings rise, a primary race in New York and President Biden’s anti-crime package reflect a more nuanced approach to crime. In more than 100 countries, the homicide rate has been falling over the past 13 years. Not so in the United States. In the past 18 months, starting before the pandemic, the murder rate has risen 25% to 30%, mainly in big cities, with warnings of a violent summer. The reasons remain unclear but combined with last year’s movement for racial justice and police reform, it could be creating...
__label__2 A Quick Reminder That Mandating Vaccines Is Totally ConstitutionalOPINIONAnti-vaxxers and anti-mask people are loud and wrong all the time. It’s a devastating combination. They’ve got an entire white-wing media echo-sphere that amplifies their wrong ideas. They have social media algorithms that elevate their ignorance and misinformation, such that even calling them out boosts their uninformed or willfully false takes. Moreover, the sheer breadth of things they are wrong about is dizzying. The vaccine has been blamed for everything from causing new Covid-19 variants (it doesn’t) to granting people the power to control metal, like Magneto (I wish). The...

So, what’s the solution to decreasing this gender gap worldwide? There’s considerable evidence that the best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The World Bank Group’s Women, Business and the Law 2021 annual report outlines the importance of gender equality for women’s...

The young man complied, releasing the bystander and tossing the gun, which skittered across the city street and then into the hands of police. They soon learned that the 9mm Beretta had a rap sheet. Bullet casings linked it to four shootings, all of them in Albany, New York. And there was something else. The pistol was U.S. Army property, a weapon intended for use against America’s enemies,...
__label__2 The Bad Science Behind Trans Healthcare BansANALYSISConservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas. “We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of HB 1570, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children. After a vote, Arkansas became the first state...
__label__4 America’s Class War Over AbortionOPINIONOn Thursday, the state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade. “Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong,” the state said in a brief submitted to the Court. “The conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition.” Mississippi was laying out its arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case that presents the best opportunity since Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) to unravel America’s abortion regime. Mississippi attorney general Lynn Fitch could have stopped short of asking for the reversal of Roe. But she...
__label__3 US saw biggest spike in gun violence in 50 years. Don’t panic yet.The surge in gun violence during the pandemic has strengthened both pro- and anti-police stances. But experts – and history – indicate that a more nuanced approach is needed. Last year likely marked America’s largest single-year rise in gun violence in 50 years – sparked by a sharp increase in shootings after the pandemic began. Though the FBI won’t release official numbers until the fall, Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at Princeton University in New Jersey and an expert on violent crime, estimates the national murder rate rose by 25% to...

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed Friday the rule barring marijuana use during the Olympic races was an "instrument of racist and colonial policy."  The congresswoman’s comments followed the announcement that U.S. champion Sha’Carri Richardson will not be running in the 100-meter race after she tested positive for THC, a chemical found in marijuana, at the Olympic trials – voiding her first-place results. Richardson, a Black woman from Texas, was given a one-month suspension, which precludes her ability to race the 100 in Tokyo but means she could still be in the running for...

But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 other states. What are the effects so far? Soon, most adult Texans will be able to openly carry a handgun in public. No background check or training necessary. It will be a major expansion in gun rights, one that Texas is uncharacteristically late in arriving at. About 20 other states already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont. Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun...

I want to talk about the power of narratives to shape racial politics in this country. As we all know George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been duly convicted of murder by a jury of his peers. The cop was white and his victim black. But I have a question: Was it a racial incident? What would we mean if we said this was a racial incident, beyond the trivial statement that one participant was...

Gun-control advocates call it the national leader, the “tip of the spear” setting the tone for other states, as Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at Brady, a gun-control advocacy group, puts it. The Golden State also has had a series of high-profile public mass shootings in recent years – in San Bernardino, Thousand Oaks, and this week, San Jose. On May 26, a gunman opened fire on...

But according to a New York Times report, Hispanic and black communities aren't buying what far-left Democrats are selling. The race to become New York City's next mayor has focused on crime and safety. Interestingly, Eric Adams, a former New York City Police captain who denounces radical anti-police policies, won a 10-point preliminary lead in the Democratic primary, which, though held last Tuesday, probably will not be officially determined...

This week, the company announced a $200-a-year program that promises consumers lower prices and exclusive access to hard-to-find devices. While the new membership also includes 24/7 tech support and free shipping, the idea of guaranteed product availability might be particularly appealing to shoppers worried that their orders won’t arrive in time for the holidays. The new Best Buy service is a stark reminder that retailers don’t anticipate that supply chain issues, including the global semiconductor chip...

And to add to the drama, rulings in the two cases are expected to come next year in the run-up to mid-term elections in a politically polarized United States that will decide if President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats maintain control over both chambers...

__label__3 8 lingering questions about the new Covid pills from Merck and PfizerThe past two months have brought extremely good news in the fight against Covid-19. Two different oral treatments have proved effective at both preventing people newly diagnosed with Covid-19 from entering the hospital and from dying. “We’re accelerating our path out of this pandemic,” President Biden said after data on the second Covid pill became available. The wide availability of oral drugs could make Covid-19 less lethal, making it less risky for people to return to in-person work and to their normal lives. The first results, from Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics,...

"I have to say to you, I've only been president for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honors I will have as president," Biden said at the White House during a signing ceremony. "I regret that...

__label__3 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...
__label__1 'Do right by that sacrifice': Veterans serving in Congress have a Memorial Day message for AmericansMemorial Day is a federal holiday that commemorates the lives of American troops who died in service to the country. While lawmakers across Washington observed the holiday through tribute services and eulogizing statements, many lawmakers who are military veterans gave especially empathic reflections. There are currently 91 veteran members of Congress, including 17 senators and 74 members of the House of Representatives. As with the broader population, the number of veterans in Congress has declined in the decades after the draft was eliminated after the Vietnam War.  That decline, the result of an...
__label__4 Baghdadi Operation Named After Christian Woman Who Refused to Give Up Faith Before ISIS Killed HerJERUSALEM, Israel – The US military operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dedicated to Kayla Mueller, a young Christian woman who was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by the Islamic State. Mueller, 26, was abducted by ISIS in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria after leaving a Doctor's Without Borders hospital there. US officials said Baghdadi tortured and repeatedly raped her at his compound before announcing in 2015 that she died in captivity. Her body has never been recovered.

__label__3 Johnson & Johnson Plans to Split Into Two Public CompaniesJohnson & Johnson JNJ 1.73% plans to break up into two companies, splitting off the $15-billion-a-year division that sells Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol medicines and Johnson’s Baby Powder in a shift indicating just how much healthcare has changed since the company helped pioneer the industry. The world’s largest health-products company by sales will separate its high-margin but less predictable prescription-drug and medical-device business from its storied but slower-growing consumer group, creating two publicly traded companies. J&J will shed its consumer division in 18 to 24 months, Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said. J&J decided to make the change, he said, because...
__label__1 After losing their moms to COVID-19, some would rather Mother's Day not 'exist at all'They all cry, naked in their grief.  One woman can't speak without weeping. Another said she didn't expect to get emotional, but when she begins to talk about her mother she asks for a moment to right herself under the unsteadying weight of loss. Another remembers the last time she saw her mom, separated by glass, anguish braiding the breath that catches in her throat.  For people who lost their mothers to COVID-19, this Mother's Day is a reminder of a freshly gaping void. Some won't celebrate the...
__label__5 Donald Trump is Obliterating ISIS Off the Face of the EarthPresident Donald J. Trump has all but wiped the Islamic State off the face of the earth, a drastic change in the war on terror compared to the previous administration. In his administration's first 11 months alone, the military has freed twice as many people and recaptured twice as much land as under the previous 18 months, reports the Washington Examiner.
__label__3 Can Colorado Hospitals Turn Away Unvaccinated Patients?FACT CHECKAn article from Red Voice Media, self-described as being owned by “patriots” and fighting “false narratives against conservatives,” claims that “Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) signed an executive order this week that allows hospitals to turn away those who are unvaccinated against COVID-19.”  According to the article, the executive order “makes it clear that it authorizes discrimination against those who are not vaccinated for COVID-19.” The claim has also been widely shared on Twitter, with one user generating thousands of likes and retweets saying that: “The dem governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, signed...
__label__1 I am ready for a new kind of Mother's DayOPINIONIf you are a parent like me, the last 14 months almost broke you. This time last year we were well into a pandemic, already exhausted (especially if we were the mothers of small children) and heartbroken. If we were lucky, we waved to our own mothers on Mother's Day, gingerly and from a distance. If you're like me, you spent last Mother's Day crying, because you missed your own mother and because being a mother had become intensely hard beyond any imagining and there seemed to be no end...

__label__3 White House unveils effort to address military toxic exposuresThe White House on Thursday announced a new strategy to identify and treat health issues in veterans who may have been exposed to chemical, physical and environmental hazards while serving. Why it matters: The Department of Veterans Affairs has recognized that certain illnesses present in veterans are directly caused by or linked to overlooked health hazards present during specific conflicts, such as Agent Orange, a herbicide used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, along the Korea demilitarized zone in the late 1960s and other locations.
__label__2 Gloria Steinem on International Women’s Day: ‘We Just Need to Keep Going’OPINIONThe fact that we have an International Women’s Day means we are still in trouble. There is no International Men’s Day. Only less powerful people or forgotten historical events need “A Day” to be part of the present. Yet it’s an important step because any notice is better than no notice. On this International Women’s Day, we might start by admitting why women are subordinated in the first place. We have the one thing that men don’t have — wombs — and they can’t perpetuate themselves or differences of race...

__label__3 Biden Administration Hopes Bigger Subsidies Will Lure More Consumers to Affordable Care Act PlansThe launch of the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment Monday will test whether more generous financial assistance to consumers helps President Biden reach his goal of boosting coverage by building on the health law. Many consumers will see lower prices because Congress passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid bill in March that provided larger premium subsidies and made more people eligible for them. Democrats are now negotiating to preserve the expanded subsidies, which are set to end next year, in Mr. Biden’s social-spending and climate bill. Sixty-seven percent of enrollees who stay with the...

Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. "Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two...
__label__2 How Negro History Week Became Black History Month and Why It Matters NowANALYSISBlack History Month has been celebrated in the United States for close to 100 years. But what is it, exactly, and how did it begin? In the years after Reconstruction, campaigning for the importance of Black history and doing the scholarly work of creating the canon was a cornerstone of civil rights work for leaders like Carter G. Woodson. Martha Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University and the Society of Black Alumni Presidential Professor, explained: “These are men [like Woodson] who were trained formally and credentialed in...
__label__5 Bombing Syria: Six Reasons Why We Shouldn’t HaveI used to have a best friend, recently in his eighties. I’m not allowed to talk to him any longer because I voted for Trump.

__label__3 More Covid Vaccine Boosters Are Coming. Who Should Get Them?ANALYSISIN THE NEXT few days, an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to debate who should receive booster shots for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, a follow-up to last week’s Food and Drug Administration committee meeting. By the end of this week, if those agencies’ directors approve, many millions more Americans should be eligible to receive additional shots. By all indications, they are likely to take them. Boosting the Covid vaccines’ effectiveness has turned out to be very popular: According to the CDC, more...
__label__2 This year, Black History Month has been overtaken by white history made on Jan. 6OPINIONBlack History Month, essential as it is, is too often a respite from white history, a way for Americans of all colors to embrace the heroics of Harriet Tubman, W.E.B. DuBois and so many others without examining the villainy of a country that made their heroics necessary. I understand the choice to hold Black stories apart from the larger American narrative, to give them the space they deserve, at least once a year. But elevating Black history in February has ironically also been a way to elevate racial denial. In...
__label__5 Israeli defense minister says his country is ready to strike IranA top Israeli official said his country is ready to strike Iran in retaliation for a recent attack on an oil tanker belonging to an Israeli firm. Defense Minister Benny Gantz replied, "Yes," when asked by the Israeli news site Ynet News on Thursday whether the Israeli Defense Forces was ready to take military action against Iran. "Iran seeks to pose a multi-front challenge to Israel, as such is building up its forces in Lebanon and Gaza, deploying militias in Syria and Iraq, and maintaining its supporters in Yemen.

__label__3 This arthritis drug cost $198 in 2008. Now it's more than $10,000In 2008, a box of 30 anti-inflammatory rectal suppositories that treats arthritis, called Indocin, had a price tag of $198. As of Oct. 1, the price of that same box was 52 times higher, totaling $10,350. Why it matters: As federal lawmakers continue to waver on drug price reforms, Indocin is another example of how nothing prevents drug companies from hiking prices at will and selling them within a broken supply chain. Driving the news: Indocin has changed ownership multiple times over the years, and the companies involved have controversial histories. Iroko Pharmaceuticals,...

But the BBC can reveal there are serious errors in a number of key studies that the drug's promoters rely on. For some years ivermectin has been a vital anti-parasitic medicine used to treat humans and animals. But during the pandemic there has been a clamour from some proponents for using the drug for something else - to fight Covid and prevent deaths. The health authorities in the US, UK...

Congressional Democrats blasted the move, accusing the Trump administration of politicizing a critical civil service position at the government’s largest spy agency. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller had ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to install Ellis before a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline, the Washington Post reported, after originally tapping him in November following Trump’s reelection loss.

After frantic negotiations, on Sunday the so-called change coalition succeeded in forming a government in Israel, replacing the country’s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, with his one-time protégé Naftali Bennett. The race is now on for “the end of Bibi” editorializing — mostly by individuals who have opposed Netanyahu and who are euphoric about his purported fall. Certainly Netanyahu’s polarizing personality and his tendency to alienate many of his closest associates have played a significant role in his...

But at some point in 2021 things will start getting better. And there’s good reason to believe that once the good news starts, the improvement in our condition will be much faster and continue much longer than many people expect. OK, one thing that probably won’t get better is the political scene. Day after day, Republicans — it’s not just Donald Trump — keep demonstrating that they’re worse...

At least 55 House members, both Democrats and Republicans, wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday urging the Pentagon to quickly work with Congress on fulfilling any request to restock Israel's supply of interceptors for the Iron Dome system.  During last month's 11-day violent conflict with the terrorist group Hamas, the missile defense system was critical in intercepting about 90 %...

This spring, as people lined up for newly available, miraculously effective Covid-19 vaccines, it was easy to imagine a direct and speedy path to a protected society.

And despite initial worries that the current vaccines may be less effective against the Delta variant, analyses suggest that both the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs reduce hospitalisation rates by 92-96%.

He made an earlier proclamation for Columbus Day where he acknowledged "the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities."

__label__5 Attorney General Merrick Garland’s Message To Concerned Parents Is Clear: Shut Up Or ElseOPINIONThe collusion between Biden’s White House, woke school boards, and the DOJ serves one purpose: to intimidate parents into silence. What do you call it when the country’s largest school board association secretly coordinates with the Biden White House before issuing a formal request that the administration use the FBI to investigate dissenting parents as potential “domestic terrorists,” and then, five days later, the Justice Department issues a memorandum to the FBI to do just that?

That role was increasingly earning the agency the ire of a growing movement, encompassing a range of opposition from faith groups to members of Congress. A Jewish activist group,...

That is not how any of this works! And yet here’s Chad Wolf, our acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, explaining to Fox News that his agents simply have...

The dynamic came to a head last week in response to the administration’s treatment of Haitian migrants who had gathered at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum.

__label__2 Ahead of the recall, Newsom lets a polarizing housing bill sit on his desk.Sitting among the hundreds of unsigned bills on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk is a measure called Senate Bill 9, which would allow duplexes on lots throughout California, including neighborhoods where apartments have long been banned. The bill was the centerpiece of this year’s legislative efforts to tackle the state’s housing and homelessness crisis, by increasing density and helping to backfill the shortage that is at the root of the state’s affordable housing problem. Economists from both parties have long advocated just such a move.

__label__3 Judge Rules Trump Administration Can’t Immediately Expel Migrant Children Under Pandemic OrderA federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration couldn’t immediately expel unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the southern border illegally and deny them a chance to request asylum under a public-health emergency the government declared in March. Under the order, agents who encounter migrants at the border immediately return them to Mexico without formally deporting them or allowing the migrants to make claims for humanitarian protection. The March 20 order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention invoked a 1944 public-health law allowing...
__label__2 You Can’t Stop Evictions If You Don’t Pay People’s RentANALYSISSome states have botched rental aid so badly they may never catch up. On August 26, the Supreme Court struck down the federal eviction moratorium. That policy, enacted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nearly a year prior, protected renters around the country from the threat of losing their homes in the midst of the pandemic. At least 1.55 million fewer eviction cases than normal were filed while the moratorium was in place, despite economic turmoil that has left more renters than ever behind on payments. While the exact timing of...

The federal agency announced its plans to mandate fixed time periods for certain visitors, citing goals to “encourage program compliance, reduce fraud and enhance national security.” The move would change current policy that allows these visitors to stay as long as they follow the “terms of admission.” DHS noted there has been “significant growth” in all three nonimmigration programs, and the proposal would “ensure the...
__label__1 Who can afford to live in the American west when locals can’t?I’ve long been accustomed to people outside the American west knowing next to nothing about my home state of Montana. Real things people have said to me over the years: is it part of Canada? Overrun with nothing but meth? A mythical place with big skies and nobody but macho cowfolk? Of course, none of those statements are true. But in the last couple of years, Montana has become a destination among both the traveling and remote-work class – and my home is changing as fast as in any previous western...
__label__5 The DOJ Released A 115-Page Rule Change To Redefine A ‘Firearm.’ Here’s What You Need To Know.ANALYSISOn Friday, The Department of Justice published a 115-page document detailing a proposed rule change that would redefine what constitutes a firearm.

__label__3 Homeland Security officials were wrongly appointed, watchdog saysWASHINGTON — The top two officials in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security were improperly appointed to the posts under federal law by the Trump administration, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog said Friday. The Government Accountability Office says acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf and his acting deputy, Ken Cuccinelli, are ineligible to run the agency under a federal law known as the Vacancy Reform Act. GAO said it has asked the DHS inspector general to review the situation and determine if the violation affects decisions they have taken at a time...
__label__2 "I just want to bust out crying": Evictions put strain on tenants and law enforcementIt's a quiet morning, but it's about to get loud. Even with a federal ban, evictions have been allowed to continue in San Antonio — but there are fewer constables to do the emotional and often chaotic job of telling families to leave their homes. "It's a lot more sensitive and dangerous because people are stressed out," said Bexar County Deputy Laura Valencia. On the day CBS News followed Valencia and her team, Bexar County constables were evicting a tenant who may be armed.

According to the Justice Department, the influx of agents will expand long-standing partnerships between city cops and agencies like the FBI. The campaign also includes $61 million worth of hiring grants for local officers.The bad news: City officials...
__label__2 How the US made affordable homes illegalANALYSISOver the past year, housing prices rose precipitously, shattering the dreams of many would-be homeowners and highlighting the underlying inequalities in the housing market.

__label__5 Psaki charges sexism and racism are part of what's driving criticism of Kamala HarrisWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said she feels that sexism and racism have contributed to the intensity of criticism faced by Vice President Kamala Harris."I do think that it has been easier and harsher from some in the right wing who have gone after her because she is the first woman, the first woman of color. I’m not suggesting anyone will acknowledge that publicly," Psaki said during an appearance on Politico's "Women Rule" podcast Wednesday.
__label__3 Barr defends aggressive federal response to protestsWASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr defended the aggressive federal law enforcement response to civil unrest in America as he testified for the first time before the House Judiciary Committee, pushing back against angry, skeptical Democrats who said President Donald Trump’s administration is unconstitutionally suppressing dissent. The hearing, held Tuesday as the late civil rights icon John Lewis laid in state steps away outside the Capitol, highlighted the wide election-year gulf between the two parties on police brutality and systemic racism in law enforcement. Massive protests have sparked unrest...
__label__2 Is There Racism in the Deed to Your Home?Last year, to celebrate the centennial of their charming Craftsman home, Kyona and Kenneth Zak repainted it in historically accurate colors — gray, bronze green and copper red. They commissioned beveled-glass windows to complement the original stained glass. And they visited the San Diego County Recorder, to have a line drawn through a sentence in their deed that once would have prohibited Ms. Zak, who is Black, from owning the home. “I’ve referred to it as the ultimate smudge stick to the house,” said Ms. Zak, an ayurvedic health counselor...

__label__3 In Portland, the Baby Fascists Have Shown Their FaceOPINIONFascism was never about actual people and their predicaments but about a glorious imaginary collective that had died but would be reborn. In the 1920s and 1930s, the idea was everywhere the same: At some point in the past, the nation or the race had been greater, purer, more beautiful. That ancient perfection could be seen in ruins, poems, monuments. Then, so the story went, another group, some inferior race, some cabal had come along and inexplicably ruined the people’s destiny. If only that group could be removed, then the...
__label__1 Nearly half of American workers don’t earn enough to afford a one-bedroom rentalNearly half of American workers do not earn enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment, according to new data. Rents in the US continued to increase through the pandemic, and a worker now needs to earn about $20.40 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom rental. The median wage in the US is about $21 an hour. The data, from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, shows that millions of Americans – from Amazon warehouse workers to cab drivers to public school teachers – are struggling to pay rent. For the poorest Americans,...
__label__5 The Collapse of Kamala HarrisANALYSISLast week, a poll by Suffolk University revealed that just 28 percent of American voters approve of the job Vice President Harris is doing. That result is shocking . . . ly high. That America’s voters disdain Harris as much as they obviously do gives me an extraordinary amount of hope for our future. In December of 2019, I celebrated Harris’s departure from the presidential primary with a “good riddance” that turned out to be woefully premature: “May Harris’s failed attempt,” I hoped, serve to “destroy her career and sully her reputation for all time.”...
__label__3 Trump announces new federal ‘surge’ of law enforcement to ChicagoPresident Donald Trump, who once bragged he could solve Chicago’s crime problem within a week, announced plans Wednesday to send a “surge of federal law enforcement” to the city to address ongoing violence. Though agents also will be sent to Albuquerque, N.M., Trump singled out Chicago as the place in the most critical need of additional resources. “Perhaps no citizens have suffered more from the menace of violent crime than the wonderful people of Chicago, a city I know very well,” Trump said.
__label__1 How Biden's Supreme Court throwdown could backfirePresident Joe Biden’s audacious move to assuage liberals by extending a pandemic-related moratorium on evictions puts him in a position he has so far avoided: inviting a high-profile showdown with the Supreme Court. If the court — as expected — shoots down the policy following a legal challenge by Alabama and Georgia Realtors' groups, it could also wind up fueling the progressive drive for Supreme Court reform that Biden has been so lukewarm about. “It will be a powerful addition to the progressive bill of particulars against this court and it...

__label__3 A surge in the US affordable housing supply is coming from people who can’t afford their homesANALYSISMore affordable housing is finally coming back onto the market. The pandemic-triggered housing boom in the US, which saw average prices rise 13.2% over the last year, is finally slowing down. More low-priced homes were put up for sale in the third quarter of 2021 than any other segment, according to the latest housing report from real estate brokerage Redfin. Homes in the “most affordable” tier, which represents homes priced below 95% of others on the market, rose by 13% compared to a year prior. The affordable listings were up across the US, but the highest...
__label__1 One way the US could have prevented the fight over the eviction moratoriumANALYSISWe don’t know enough to help. We don’t know how many people have received eviction notices since the moratorium expired over the weekend. We will never know how many people were informally evicted — people who left their homes quickly out of fear of being asked to pay what they do not have, or people who faced lock-outs or intimidation from their landlords. We don’t even really know how many renters were actually at risk of eviction or which landlords are on the brink of financial ruin over the last...

But those fuel tanks and junked cars will still loom like a storm cloud in the distance, an “important reminder,” says Ms. Owen-White, of “what my job is and why this refuge exists.” Valle de Oro represents something of a new dawn for...
__label__1 How Democrats Screwed Up So Royally on EvictionsANALYSISLast Thursday, as the House of Representatives was wrapping up lingering business before leaving town for the summer, the White House threw a grenade into Democratic leaders’ laps. You know that CDC eviction moratorium that was set to lapse at the end of July—as in, a few days later? The White House would need Congress to pass legislation extending that, immediately. The July 31 deadline has come and gone, with neither Democrats in Congress nor the White House having extended it. This could leave millions without housing as landlords resume what they...

The United States stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats,” she added. The rebuke comes as China has used the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as a propaganda point,...

But as the history of housing discrimination illustrates, it’s a human-made system, not a natural one. Becoming a first-generation homebuyer was a meaningful step for Erin. Her parents came to the United States from Cape Verde and had never been able to purchase a house. She was excited for the stability it would provide and the financial investment in her future. But as a 40-year-old Black woman in the Boston area, Erin, who didn’t want to be named for employment...
__label__1 The lapsed eviction moratorium is the Supreme Court’s faultOPINIONOn Sunday, a federal eviction moratorium, which was intended to prevent renters from losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic, expired. At its height, this moratorium may have saved as many as 40 million Americans from eviction. But, in late June, the Supreme Court signaled that this moratorium must expire at the end of July, effectively leaving many renters without protection. In theory, most of these renters — and their landlords — should have received federal housing assistance. Over the course of the pandemic, Congress allocated $45 billion in rent...
__label__4 Kamala Harris breaks silence on Afghanistan debacle as Singapore prime minister admits withdrawal went 'awry'Vice President Kamala Harris at last spoke publicly on what is happening in Afghanistan as Americans and Afghans try to exit the country due to the Taliban’s swift takeover, but she refused to weigh in on the U.S. government’s decision-making that led to the current situation. During an appearance alongside Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, both leaders were asked about the U.S. withdrawal and evacuation process, with Harris being asked what she thinks went wrong. "So, I understand and appreciate why you asked the question. And I think there's going to be plenty...

Now, in the minority of people returning to office buildings in the area, Byrnes says he’s in and out with his meal in under two minutes. But he’d much prefer to be standing in a line full of people again. “We’re nowhere near where we need to be to have a sustained retail and restaurant climate in this area,” said Byrnes, president...

Democrats “Failed to Meet This Moment,” Say Democrats.The federal eviction moratorium ends today, and housing rights advocates and tenants around the country worry that anywhere between hundreds of thousands and millions of people will be thrown onto the streets in the coming days and weeks. Congressional Democrats on Friday night attempted to pass an extension of the moratorium. Not only couldn’t they get any Republicans to sign on, but they couldn’t even persuade enough of their own members to hammer out a deal done before adjourning for a six-week summer recess. “Some Democrats, privately, have tried to kill this...

But Harris’ office has argued that the trip — planned before last weekend’s Taliban seizure of Kabul — shouldn’t be “bogged down” by comparing Afghanistan to past calamities including the US defeat by Vietnam’s Communist government in the 1970s. “We don’t want to get bogged down in the...

So now we’re homeless - me, my 16-year-old son, my daughter and my grandchild, a toddler.” Her confusion is a common theme across America at a time when the federal government has ended...

Governor Newsom took office in 2018 with 61.9 percent of the vote—the highest percentage that any Democratic candidate for governor ever received in the state. And polling of California voters shows that solid majorities oppose his recall. But a poll this week from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies paints a very different picture. What that poll found was that Newsom’s opponents were far more engaged in the recall process than...

__label__3 Supreme Court Blocks Biden Administration’s New Eviction MoratoriumThe Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the latest federal ban on evictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, siding with landlords against a moratorium the Biden administration imposed this month despite questions about its legality. Three liberal justices dissented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly renewed the eviction moratorium for millions of tenants affected by the pandemic, in large part to allow them to remain in their homes as state and local governments struggle to disburse some $47 billion of rental assistance provided by Congress. The current order was set to expire Oct. 3;...

Data released Tuesday added to the evidence that builders are pulling back. Single family housing starts continued to rise in June, many of those for homes already sold. But building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell more than expected last month to the lowest point since August and were about 100,000 units below the six-month average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. “The single family market in particular...

They show the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) lobbying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — and succeeding in having some of their recommendations adopted.
__label__4 Why are so many Haitians at the US-Mexico border?Thousands of predominantly Haitian migrants are still camped at the US border, where officials have struggled to provide them with food and sanitation. Last weekend, approximately 13,000 would-be migrants gathered under a bridge connecting Del Rio in Texas with Ciudad Acuña in Mexico. Many of the migrants are fleeing natural disasters, poverty and political turmoil, and making a treacherous journey through Latin America to reach the border. Who are the migrants? While citizens of several countries are represented in the migrant camp in Del Rio - including Dominicans, Venezuelans and...
__label__2 Biden in a bind on the border: 'The politics finally got the better of their policy'Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, called the Border Patrol “egregious and white supremacist.” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said it was “worse than what we witnessed in slavery.” The pair spent years targeting similar criticism at former President Donald Trump for his handling of the border. But this time, they were talking about fellow Democrat President Joe Biden's administration, which continues to deport Haitian migrants and others seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border under a controversial Trump-era public health order. Trump polarized the politics of immigration in a way...
__label__4 Biden to sign order mandating $15 minimum wage for federal contractorsPresident Joe Biden will sign an executive order that will raise the minimum wage to $15 for all workers employed by federal contractors. Biden plans to sign the executive order on Tuesday, according to administration officials. The mandate, which will affect hundreds of thousands of workers on federal contracts, requires that all agencies implement the new minimum wage into contracts by March 30, 2022. It will also require that federal agencies implement the higher wages into existing contracts when they are extended. “This [executive order] promotes economy and efficiency in...
__label__3 U.S. envoy resigns over expulsions to Haiti from Texas campThe U.S. envoy to Haiti dramatically resigned on Thursday in a letter that excoriated Washington for deporting hundreds of migrants to the crisis-engulfed Caribbean nation from a border camp in recent days. The resignation was confirmed by a senior official at the U.S. State Department. "I will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants," Daniel Foote said in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken that circulated publicly on Thursday. Foote, a career diplomat named in...
__label__2 Biden slips into political quicksand amid Haitian migrant buildupANALYSISThe mass of thousands of Haitians at the U.S. southern border has put the Biden administration in the exact place it’s tried to avoid: knee deep in immigration politics. In the past 24 hours, the White House has responded to images and videos of aggressive tactics used by Border Patrol agents to corral those migrants by supporting an internal investigation into the matter. What it hasn’t done, yet, is figure out a solution to the crowding and sanitary issues arising in what’s become a makeshift encampment — or stop its policy of...
__label__5 Biden’s Pick for Top Labor Spot Oversaw Fraudulent, Broken Unemployment SystemCalifornia's unemployment system paid out billions of dollars of fraudulent claims under the leadership of President Joe Biden's nominee for the number two post at the Labor Department. As California's secretary of labor, Julie Su oversaw an unemployment website plagued by glitches and improper payments. The website repeatedly crashed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and was down as recently as this month. These systemic failures pose a challenge for Su, whom Biden has nominated to serve as deputy labor secretary. Su has faced bipartisan pushback during her confirmation hearings, with moderate...
__label__3 What did Trump’s 2nd impeachment accomplish?Former President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate on Saturday of the charge that he incited the insurrection on Jan. 6. The impeachment trial ended with 57 senators, including seven Republicans, finding Trump guilty — well short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict. Over the course of a week of testimony, House impeachment managers laid out the case that Trump was directly responsible for the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol carried out by a mob of his supporters. Trump’s attorneys countered by arguing that his baseless claims...
__label__1 The I-word looms: McCarthy faces internal pressure to go harder at Biden on AfghanistanAs hard as Kevin McCarthy has hammered the White House over the chaotic and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, he’s under rising pressure from his right to go further. The House minority leader has repeatedly pushed back on rank-and-file Republicans who want to make a high-stakes call for impeaching Biden over his handling of Afghanistan — a vow that would come due should the GOP take back the chamber next November. But multiple House Republican sources said that even before Tuesday’s fraught end to the U.S. military mission, their offices...
__label__5 Going To Gender JailOPINIONOver the years, you’ve probably heard transgender activists and their allies argue in some form that their bodies are a prison preventing them from becoming their true self. Apparently, more and more governments seem to think that because transgender inmates are already imprisoned by their own flesh and blood, where they’re incarcerated doesn’t matter all too much. A dozen transgender prisoners that have been convicted of sexual or violent crimes are being held in women’s prisons in Scotland, the Timesreported last week. Of the 12 biologically male inmates, only one had undergone surgery and...
__label__3 Four impeachments, zero removals: Sign of cracks in Constitution?A key check on presidential power doesn’t seem to be working the way the Founding Fathers envisioned. We look where a cycle of partisanship may head. After two tumultuous impeachments of former President Donald Trump in little over a year, it’s clear that today the impeachment process works far differently than the Founding Fathers intended. The authors of the Constitution believed that members of Congress would rally together to defend the legislature’s prerogatives against intrusions from the executive. But James Madison and his fellows didn’t foresee the effects of the...
__label__2 Impeachment witness Gordon Sondland sues Pompeo and U.S. over $1.8 million in legal feesGordon Sondland, the former U.S. Ambassador to the European Union who was a key witness in the 2019 impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump, filed suit against the U.S. government and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday, arguing he reneged on a promise to reimburse Sondland for attorneys' fees accrued during the House investigation. Sondland, who was fired after his bombshell testimony in the impeachment probe, said he incurred nearly $1.8 million in legal fees and accused Pompeo of abandoning his pledge that the State Department would cover his costs for political convenience. "If...
__label__4 Netflix Responds To Far-Left Outrage Over Dave Chappelle: We Support His ‘Artistic Freedom’Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos addressed outrage from some inside the company over a new comedy special featuring legendary comedian Dave Chappelle, saying that the company supports Chappelle’s “artistic freedom.” The Netflix special “The Closer” has been widely praised by many online and in reviews with audience scores reaching as high as 97% on the popular website Rotten Tomatoes. Chappelle triggered the far-left with jokes about the trans community, defending J.K. Rowling, and going after the LGBT community for trying to cancel a rapper over a comment the rapper made.
__label__3 GOP Senators Who Voted to Convict Donald Trump Face Local CensuresRepublican senators who voted to convict former President Donald Trump were rebuked by GOP chapters in their states, with many local groups either censuring them or considering doing so. During the week-long unprecedented second impeachment trial, Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) stood at odds with their party and joined 50 Democrats in finding Trump guilty of inciting the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump was acquitted on Saturday, as the...
__label__2 The Theory That Explains How Senate Republicans Justify Acquitting TrumpANALYSISOn the most recent episode of Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick spoke with renowned communications researcher and campaign adviser Anat Shenker-Osorio about the messaging of impeachment, how Republicans justify acquittal, and why it’s so dangerous to give Marjorie Taylor Greene a microphone. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Dahlia Lithwick: Set the table for us about how you have come to think about language, and messaging, and politics, and all the ways in which progressives just really are generally suck-ish at some of this. Anat Shenker-Osorio: It’s hard to...
__label__5 Forcing Women To Compete Against Biological Men Is Unfair, Data ShowsWhile some Democrats have spent months throwing tantrums over letting biological men play on women’s sports teams, new studies show transgender women do have an unfair advantage over biological females when it comes to sports. Daily Caller “Presents The Facts” addresses some of the most misleading claims promulgated by high-profile officials and so-called social justice warriors to give Daily Caller readers the ammunition to tackle everyday political conversations and debates. Hosted by Brianna Lyman, these videos also seek to explore the truth that is often shrouded by corporate media.
__label__3 7 GOP Senators Voted To Convict Trump. Only 1 Faces Voters Next YearA majority of senators voted Saturday to convict former President Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection at the U.S Capitol. But the Democrats' side needed 17 Republicans to join them in order to reach the two-thirds threshold needed to convict. Seven GOP senators voted with Democrats — the most bipartisan impeachment vote in U.S. history — but well short of the 17 needed to convict the former president. Of those seven Republicans, two are retiring and only one — Alaska's Lisa Murkowski — faces her state's...
__label__2 Trump’s team glosses over his Jan. 6 tiradeFACT CHECKDonald Trump’s legal team thoroughly distorted his remarks from the rally that prefaced the storming of the Capitol last month, seizing on the one instance when Trump spoke of peaceful protest in his “fight like hell” tirade of anger and grievance. Trump attorney Michael van der Veen accused House Democratic impeachment managers of showing selectively edited scenes of the violence and Trump’s words Jan. 6. Yet he ignored the incendiary substance and tenor of that staging speech as well as the president’s words of affection for the attackers later, while...
__label__5 Critics call to cancel Dave Chappelle, Netflix for ‘ridiculing trans people’Cancel culture is threatening to shutdown Dave Chappelle’s “The Closer.”The always outspoken stand-up comic is pushing the public’s buttons again — and a swelling wave of culture critics and activist organizations are calling for his brand-new Netflix special to be yanked from the streaming giant’s catalog.The special — the sixth and final in the Emmy winner’s big-bucks deal with Netflix — premiered Tuesday, and immediately stoked the flames of controversy with incendiary jokes about transgender women.
__label__3 Senate reaches deal on Trump call during riot, averting impeachment delayDemocrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate headed off a prolonged impeachment trial for Donald Trump on Saturday with an agreement to enter into evidence details of the former president’s remarks in a call with a top Republican during the deadly Capitol riot.
__label__1 Do Senate Republicans understand patriotism?OPINIONThe nation just spent three sobering days watching Democratic members of the House lay out a deeply compelling case that the president of the United States urged his supporters to come to Washington, fired them up at a “Save America” rally outside the White House in which he lied, yet again, about a stolen election, and then sent them off down the National Mall to do something about it. “Patriots,” President Trump called them. Maybe he misspoke. Maybe he meant to say “rioters” but jumbled the pronunciation.
__label__5 School Investigates Teacher Who Said She Told Students to Pledge Allegiance to Pride FlagA California school district is investigating one of its teachers for encouraging students to pledge allegiance to the pride flag in place of the American flag, according to a viral video posted by the teacher and a district statement. Fox News identified the teacher as Kristin Pitzen of Newport-Mesa Unified School District in Orange County. In a video, she shared that she took down the American flag in her classroom because it made her “uncomfortable.” She said through giggles that she had packed it away and hadn’t found it yet, but...
__label__3 Biden ‘Anxious’ To See How Republicans Handle Impeachment TrialPresident Joe Biden says he is ‘anxious’ to see how Republicans approach former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. A reporter asked Biden if he had any thoughts on the trial after the House impeachment managers rested their case. “I am just anxious to see what my Republican friends do, will they stand up?” Biden said on the White House lawn along with First lady Jill Biden on Friday. On Thursday, a reporter questioned Biden about whether he saw the video of the riots being presented at the trial and for...
__label__2 How solid is Donald Trump’s First Amendment impeachment defense?ANALYSISOn the Senate floor, former President Donald Trump’s defense team used a series of quick-cut videos to make a case that the words he spoke to supporters before the storming of the Capitol were just the kinds of words Democrats use all the time to rally their supporters.A key element of Trump’s defense is that his words at the Jan. 6 rally were protected by the First Amendment. During the Feb. 12 trial session, Trump’s attorneys laid out two questions on the First Amendment.
__label__5 Texas Governor Orders Review of Whether Gender-Transition Surgery Constitutes Child AbuseTexas governor Greg Abbott on Friday directed the state Department of Family Protective Services to issue a determination on whether gender-transition surgery on children constitutes child abuse. “Subjecting a child to genital mutilation through reassignment surgery creates a ‘genuine threat of substantial harm from physical injury to the child,’” Abbott wrote in a letter to the department. “This broad definition of ‘abuse’ should cover a surgical procedure that will sterilize the child, such as orchiectomy or hysterectomy, or remove otherwise healthy body parts, such as penectomy or mastectomy. Indeed, Texas already outlaws female genital...
__label__3 A timeline of what Donald Trump said before the Capitol riotFACT CHECKIn the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, President Donald Trump repeatedly said he wanted his supporters to fight Congress on accepting the electoral college results that showed Joe Biden won. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women,” Trump told his supporters shortly before the Capitol assault. “We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have...
__label__2 Three GOP senators meet with Trump's lawyers on eve of impeachment defense presentationA trio of Republican senators allied with former President Donald Trump met with his defense team Thursday evening, in the middle of an impeachment trial in which they will vote on whether to convict Trump and potentially bar him from holding public office again. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah were spotted going into a room in the US Capitol that Trump's lawyers were using to prepare for their arguments. Trump lawyer David Schoen said that the senators were "very...

Hubbard, a biological male who identifies as a female, will compete Monday at the Tokyo Olympics against biological women in weightlifting. Hubbard formerly competed against male weightlifters before the athlete identified as a woman and was allowed access to female competitions. “To put it in a nutshell, the IOC had a scientific consensus back in 2015,” Budgett explained. “There are no...
__label__3 DOJ: Extremist leader was "awaiting direction" from Trump ahead of Jan. 6A leader of the far-right "Oath Keepers" militia who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6 "indicated that she was awaiting direction from President Trump" as Biden's inauguration approached, federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Thursday. Why it matters: Multiple defendants have told media outlets and law enforcement that they attended Trump's Jan. 6 rally at the president's request. But the assertion made Thursday, which was first reported by CNN, is the most direct link yet that prosecutors have drawn between Trump's rhetoric and the breach at the Capitol....

__label__3 Senators vote to proceed with Trump's impeachment trial after graphic videoU.S. senators voted on Tuesday to move forward with Donald Trump’s impeachment trial on a charge of inciting the deadly assault on the Capitol, rejecting a claim the proceeding was unconstitutional after viewing graphic video of the January attack. The Senate voted 56-44 to proceed with its trial of the former president, a historic first, rejecting largely along party lines his defense lawyers’ argument that a president cannot face trial after leaving the White House. Democrats hope to disqualify Trump from ever again holding public office. The video presented by...
__label__1 Biden plows ahead on pandemic agenda — with an eye on Trump’s trialWhite House aides have gone to great lengths this week to emphasize that President Biden is paying minimal attention, if any, to the fiery and harrowing trial of his predecessor unfolding down the street at the Capitol. But as Biden on Thursday assiduously attended to his agenda — visiting the National Institues of Health for a vaccine announcement, talking with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — he let slip that he has at least one eye on the trial of former president Donald Trump. Biden said he’d seen some of the...
__label__5 Why California Just Added Five More States to Its Travel BanCalifornia added five Republican states to its travel ban, the state attorney general announced Monday, meaning state-funded travel is no longer allowed under most circumstances. The ban is in protest of what the attorney general claims are laws that discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Florida, Montana, Arkansas and West Virginia have sought to protect women by preventing transgender women and girls from playing in school sports according to their gender identity. In North Dakota’s case, the state passed a free speech law that critics say will restrict LGBTQ...
__label__3 Trump impeachment: Outcome may be foregone conclusion, but impact isn’tImpeachment proceedings aren’t only about the final result, but also about establishing a precedent and shaping public opinion. At a time when many are invoking lofty ideals and the Founding Fathers as justification either for or against impeachment proceedings, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar favors a line from comedian Trevor Noah. “If you get fired at Best Buy, they don’t just let you steal a TV on the way out,” she says, pushing back against the Republican argument that it’s overreach to hold an impeachment trial for a president who has...
__label__2 Impeachment prosecutors wrap up case: Here are the top takeaways from trial's third dayANALYSISHouse impeachment managers spent the last day of their arguments in the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump telling senators that he reasonably should have known his actions would lead to violence and refuting what they expect his defense lawyers will say in the next two days of trial. The prosecutors are hoping to convince senators that Trump should be convicted on the charge that he incited the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, but they will need 17 Republicans to side with all Democrats and independents to...
__label__5 Transgender student wins as Supreme Court rebuffs bathroom appealThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a major transgender rights case, leaving in place a lower court's ruling that a Virginia public school board acted unlawfully in preventing a transgender student from using a bathroom at his high school that corresponded with his gender identity. The justices opted not to hear the Gloucester County School Board's appeal of a 2020 ruling by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that transgender student Gavin Grimm is protected under the federal law that bars sex discrimination in education, known...
__label__3 What’s behind the growing gap between men and women in college completion?DATAThe growing gender gap in higher education – both in enrollment and graduation rates – has been a topic of conversation and debate in recent months. Young women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, and among those ages 25 and older, women are more likely than men to have a four-year college degree. The gap in college completion is even wider among younger adults ages 25 to 34. Women’s educational gains have occurred alongside their growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy. The implications...
__label__2 The House impeachment managers’ case against Trump, summarized in 500 wordsANALYSISThe Democratic case against Donald Trump during his second impeachment trial on Wednesday aimed at establishing one central thesis: that the January 6 Capitol insurrection wasn’t some random outburst of violence — it was an effort to overthrow democracy the then-president spent months cultivating. Republican defenders of Trump have tried to distance him from the insurrection by arguing he had nothing to do with its planning, and delivered a speech just before it that was basically a normal political speech. House Democrats tried to convict Trump on an incitement charge...
__label__4 DOJ Challenges Arkansas, West Virginia Transgender LawsThe Justice Department has filed statements of interest in two lawsuits challenging Arkansas and West Virginia laws pertaining to transgender people, saying the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.In the Arkansas case, the DOJ criticized a new state law prohibiting doctors from performing gender-transition surgery on, or prescribing puberty blockers to, minors. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging that law in a suit filed in May.
__label__3 Wanted, due to supply chain shortages: used crutches, walkers and canesFrom Utah to South Carolina and Kentucky, hospitals and charities are asking for gently used crutches, canes and walkers. Supplies are getting harder to come by thanks to — let’s all say it together — supply chain problems. The main issue seems to be the unreliable supply of aluminum, which is used to make the products. In Bluffton, South Carolina, Beaufort Memorial Hospital put out a plea: “The impacts of the global pandemic continue to affect so many aspects of healthcare,” BMH president and CEO Russell Baxley said in a...
__label__1 Democrats Use Video, Trump’s Words to Build Impeachment CaseHouse Democrats showed chilling new video of the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as they portrayed the siege and assault on Congress as the inevitable result of former President Donald Trump stoking rage among his supporters over his defeat in the election. The House impeachment managers spent the second day of Trump’s Senate impeachment trial describing how Trump tried to sow doubt about the Nov. 3 election results months beforehand, as well as his weeks-long efforts afterward to reverse his loss to Democrat Joe Biden with “the...
__label__5 Biden Budget Proposal Refers To Mothers As ‘Birthing People’President Joe Biden’s $6 trillion budget proposal demands $200 million for maternal health care — but refers to mothers as “birthing people,” adopting progressive parlance designed to ignore gender-based distinctions. The provision appears in the budget draft’s healthcare spending designations, in a line item that allocates “$200 million to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates nationwide; bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees; help cities place early childhood development experts in pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients; implement implicit bias training for healthcare...

The department did not identify the passport recipient, but Dana Zzyym of Fort Collins, Colorado, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview it was their passport. Zzyym, who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun, has been in a legal battle with...
__label__2 Trump’s lawyers and the ConstitutionFACT CHECKLawyers for Donald Trump stretched beyond the facts when they argued there’s an open-and-shut case that the Constitution bars impeaching former presidents. That question is not settled, though the weight of legal views contradicts the Trump team’s assertions. Bruce Castor and David Schoen addressed the Senate Tuesday on the first day of Trump’s trial after Democratic impeachment managers from the House presented the opening of their case for conviction. Trump is accused of inciting the deadly siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Democrats overcame a procedural hurdle as...

The Pentagon will "maintain existing policy for the display of unofficial flags" and "not grant an exception to display the Pride flag" at military bases, spokesman John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. Kirby added that the decision does not "in any way reflect on the respect and admiration we feel for all our LGBTQ+ personnel in and out of uniform." The statement puts the Defense...
__label__3 This arthritis drug cost $198 in 2008. Now it's more than $10,000In 2008, a box of 30 anti-inflammatory rectal suppositories that treats arthritis, called Indocin, had a price tag of $198. As of Oct. 1, the price of that same box was 52 times higher, totaling $10,350. Why it matters: As federal lawmakers continue to waver on drug price reforms, Indocin is another example of how nothing prevents drug companies from hiking prices at will and selling them within a broken supply chain. Driving the news: Indocin has changed ownership multiple times over the years, and the companies involved have controversial histories. Iroko Pharmaceuticals,...
__label__2 The 6 Senate Republicans to watch on impeachmentANALYSISWhen it comes to this week’s impeachment trial, the Senate Republican conference is poised to stay pretty united, barring a handful of exceptions. Most Republicans, after all, have signaled that they won’t vote to convict former President Donald Trump, while only a few have indicated an openness to considering it. During a vote on the constitutionality of the proceedings a few weeks ago, five Republican senators joined Democrats to affirm that they believed the trial should be allowed to move forward. Those lawmakers — Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins...

Starting next fall, the nation’s largest school district will no longer admit incoming kindergartners into special gifted classes or schools. Instead, accelerated learning will be made accessible to all students in their own schools. The impending change comes after years of criticism of the racial makeup of students in the city’s gifted and talented program. About 75 percent of the 16,000 students in New York’s gifted...
__label__1 Impeachment Poses One QuestionOPINIONMuch of the legal wrangling serves to obscure the central matter before the Senate. One casualty of a moment in American life when politics seems to pervade everything is an inability by many prominent people to tease apart what is and is not a matter of politics. The second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, which gets under way today, offers several prime examples. As the refrain went during Trump’s first impeachment, in 2019 and early 2020, the impeachment process is political and not legal, even though it resembles...
__label__4 VA Teacher Placed On Administrative Leave After Refusing To Affirm Trans Identity For Kids, Citing FaithAn elementary school teacher in Virginia was placed on administrative leave this week after refusing to affirm transgender identities in children, claiming such behavior is against his faith and “defiles the holy image of God.” Byron “Tanner” Cross, who teaches physical education at Leesburg Elementary School, explained to the Loudoun County school board Tuesday that he will not “affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa” because he loves children who struggle with gender dysphoria and refuses to lie to them, according to Fox News.

Even when photojournalists and writers have come from diverse backgrounds, few decisions in the newsroom have been directed by someone BIPOC. On one of the first days of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Los Angeles, where we live, KTLA’s headline read, “Protestors block 101 Freeway, smash patrol car window in downtown L.A. during protest over George Floyd’s death.” MPR News, a news organization based where Floyd lived, had the headline “‘Unbelievable devastation’: 1 dead as Floyd protests boil...
__label__1 Impeachment minefield awaits 2024 GOP fieldDonald Trump’s acquittal in his impeachment trial is all but a sure thing. What’s still unsettled is how the Republican senators seeking to take his place in the 2024 presidential primary will navigate the minefield before the verdict is official. Torn between demands of the GOP’s pro-Trump base and traditionalists mortified by Trump’s post-election behavior, senators like Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton will be forced to strike a balance. That means calibrating their defense of Trump for a primary electorate whose level of devotion to the...
__label__5 Biden To Skip Notre Dame Commencement Amid Furor Over Policies That Defy Church TeachingsPresident Joe Biden on Sunday will break a 20-year tradition of a president or vice president delivering a commencement address at the University of Notre Dame during the first year of a new presidency. Sources at the White House claimed the school had invited Biden to speak, but said the nation’s second Roman Catholic president is unable to attend because of a scheduling conflict, according to the Catholic News Agency (CNA). Jimmy Dunne, who is a finance executive and trustee of the university, will address the graduates instead.
__label__3 Congress is trying, again, to end hunger in the militaryIn 2016, Erika Tebbens was living outside Seattle, one of the most expensive places in America, trying to feed a family of three on her husband’s enlisted sailor's salary of less than $25,000 a year. Tebbens said she did not qualify for Agriculture Department nutrition assistance because of a rule that military personnel include in their income any housing allowance they receive. That same rule was a big reason a Pentagon poverty assistance program that started in 2000 failed to help many servicemembers and was discontinued in 2016.

__label__5 Marijuana Arrests Plunged Last Year, Reflecting the Impact of LegalizationLast year, according to data the FBI published this week, police in the United States made about 350,000 arrests for marijuana offenses, the lowest level recorded in three decades. The 36 percent drop in 2020, which follows an 18 percent decrease in 2019, reflects the impact of ballot initiatives and legislation that eliminated penalties for low-level possession last year or earlier. It may also reflect the impact of COVID-19 restrictions that drove cannabis consumers indoors, where they were less likely to be noticed by police. As usual, the vast majority of marijuana arrests in 2020 (91...

The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...
__label__1 Is it constitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former president?ANALYSISNo one knows whether the Constitution permits the Senate to hold an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump, now that he no longer holds office. To be sure, there is a bevy of legal scholarship discussing this question. And, as a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes, “most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.” But while the Constitution mentions impeachment six times, the text of the...
__label__5 AOC says Olympic ban on marijuana is 'instrument' of racism following Black track star's suspensionNew York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed Friday the rule barring marijuana use during the Olympic races was an "instrument of racist and colonial policy."  The congresswoman’s comments followed the announcement that U.S. champion Sha’Carri Richardson will not be running in the 100-meter race after she tested positive for THC, a chemical found in marijuana, at the Olympic trials – voiding her first-place results. Richardson, a Black woman from Texas, was given a one-month suspension, which precludes her ability to race the 100 in Tokyo but means she could still be in the running for...
__label__3 Hate crimes against Asian and Black people rise sharply in the U.S., FBI saysThe number of reported hate crimes nationwide against Asian and Black people sharply increased in 2020, according to new FBI data released Monday. Hate crimes targeting people of Asian descent rose by a whopping 70% last year compared with the number of such incidents in 2019, the FBI said. That increase coincided with the outbreak in the United States of the Covid-19 pandemic, which some racists have unjustly blamed on Asian Americans because of the coronavirus’ origin in China. Rhetoric attacking the Chinese government from former President Donald Trump and his allies...
__label__2 Impeachment Case Aims to Marshal Outrage of Capitol Attack Against TrumpWhen House impeachment managers prosecute former President Donald J. Trump this week for inciting the Capitol attack, they plan to mount a fast-paced, cinematic case aimed at rekindling the outrage lawmakers experienced on Jan. 6. Armed with lessons from Mr. Trump’s first impeachment trial, which even Democrats complained was repetitive and sometimes sanctimonious, the prosecutors managing his second are prepared to conclude in as little as a week, forgo distracting witness fights and rely heavily on video, according to six people working on the case. It would take 17 Republicans...

Why it matters: New cases of coronavirus, driven by the Delta variant, are up 86% in the U.S. over the past two weeks. The rise in new infections has upended return to work plans for certain sectors of the economy, while others can't afford to change course.

Lindsey Graham’s threat to call the FBI as a witness at Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, and about the “precedent” of expelling QAnon Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from House committees. On Thursday morning, Speaker Pelosi held her weekly press conference, which ended in some minor fireworks when the last two questions tested her patience. First was a question about Graham’s odd threat. Pelosi was asked “Senator Graham said that if the Democrats call...

The bill is expected to die in Mitch McConnell’s Senate.
__label__3 A timely lesson from a tiny town long agoANALYSISRecently, a friend gave me the book “A Stronger Kinship” by historian Anna-Lisa Cox. It tells of Covert, Michigan, a small town 30 miles from my friend’s childhood home.  His nearly all-white high school had played them in sports, yet only now was he learning that more than a century ago, Black and white residents of Covert had “lived as equal citizens,” as the book puts it.  As far back as the 1860s, they treated each other as neighbors regardless of race, farming side by side. Black men not only...

__label__5 San Francisco Considers $1,000 Fines for People Smoking Tobacco or Cannabis in Their ApartmentsSan Francisco politicians are considering yet another policy that would harm renters while infringing on property rights: a ban on smoking inside private apartment buildings. On Thursday, a committee of the city's Board of Supervisors voted to advance a bill that would ban smoking inside private dwellings located in apartments with three or more units. The San Francisco Examiner reports that the restrictions would apply not just to tobacco products, but also to smoking marijuana and even to vaping.

Why it matters: The findings in the poll, conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of a group of reproductive justice organizations, appear to confirm the highly-motivated voting bloc's emerging power. Advocates warn that the GOP's efforts to restrict voting access, including targeting vote by mail and early voting, will disproportionately impact people of color. By the numbers: Eight in 10 women...
__label__1 More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report saysMore and more people are identifying as members of the LGBTQ community. Increased visibility educates non-LGBTQ people, but it also comes with a purported price, according to GLAAD's annual Accelerating Acceptance Study out Wednesday. The report found that 43% of non-LGBTQ people think gender is not exclusively male and female, up from 38% in 2020. And 81% of non-LGBTQ people anticipate nonbinary and transgender people will become as familiar in everyday life as gay and lesbian people have. "Our community continues to grow, and we're seeing some growing acceptance of that," says Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD CEO. "We...

__label__2 “What Exactly Is the Plan for Us?”OPINIONMary Baliker, a 58-year-old kidney transplant recipient living in Middleton, Wisconsin, is no stranger to blood tests. But this one was different. As part of a clinical study on antibody responses, she has been periodically FedEx-ing her blood to Johns Hopkins, where doctors have been looking for immune responses to the Moderna vaccine. Because she takes immunosuppressive drugs so her body doesn’t reject the donated organ, it wasn’t very likely that the vaccine would prompt the immune response it is supposed to. Nevertheless, she held out hope. When the final...

The Indian Health Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is not keeping track. The Centers for Disease Control cannot tell us.

__label__2 More Than Half of America’s 100 Richest People Exploit Special Trusts to Avoid Estate TaxesIt’s well known, at least among tax lawyers and accountants for the ultrawealthy: The estate tax can be easily avoided by exploiting a loophole unwittingly created by Congress three decades ago. By using special trusts, a rarefied group of Americans has taken advantage of this loophole, reducing government revenues and fueling inequality. There is no way for the public to know who uses these special trusts aside from when they’ve been disclosed in lawsuits or securities filings. There’s also been no way to quantify just how much in estate tax...

In an 80-page report released Monday, the Aspen Institute’s “Commission on Information Disorder” calls for “structural changes” to “our information ecosystem” and blames “leaders” and tech companies for not doing enough to combat disinformation, apparently dissatisfied with the Biden White House working in tandem to “flag” misinformation for Facebook censors. “Disinformation...

Advocates hope budget bill is the answerWASHINGTON – For decades, lawmakers and immigrant advocates have been working to pass immigration reform on Capitol Hill, often looking to pass bipartisan legislation to extend protections and pathways to citizenship for farmworkers and those who are undocumented. Success has been elusive, but advocates and some members of Congress see the $3.5 trillion budget bill that Democrats and President Joe Biden want to pass this fall as one of their best bets of passing sweeping changes to the nation's immigration laws.  Democrats are hoping to include in the bill pathways to...

VERDICT: WTF is he talking about? As of this week, almost 350,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Biden's watch at an average rate of 1,172 per day. That is more than the combined total of American combat deaths in the First and Second World Wars. It is the...

It shows that the basic wealth levels of families from different racial and ethnic backgrounds have diverged to such a stark degree in the...
__label__5 Team Biden and its media apologists blame you for supply shortages the White House refuses to fixOPINIONWorried about the shortages of goods due to the supply chain crisis? You’re right to be. But instead of fixing the problem, President Joe Biden and his team are blaming you for it — and telling Americans to just suck it up. It’s outrageous. And short-sighted. The images of hundreds of cargo ships waiting to be unloaded isn’t one of those economic issues ordinary people have a hard time understanding. The inability of the transportation system to handle the flow of goods shipped from manufacturers is threatening to not only make it harder to get...

Mr. Baugh runs an environmental nonprofit called Upstream Alliance, and he’d spent the day on the water pointing out sewage outflows to staff from New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection. Now it was dusk, and Mr. Baugh wanted to load his boat and leave before dark. Across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Camden is one of America’s poorest...

Real things people have said to me over the years: is it part of Canada? Overrun with nothing but meth? A mythical place with big skies and nobody but macho cowfolk? Of course, none of those statements are true. But in the last couple of years, Montana has become a destination among both the traveling and remote-work class – and my home is changing as fast as in any previous western...
__label__4 Why Are the Media Treating 'Let's Go Brandon' Like Criminal Hate Speech?ANALYSISLast month, NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his victory in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Sparks 300 race when fans started chanting "fuck Joe Biden." But that's not what Stavast heard. And so the "let's go Brandon" chant—a less vulgar way of signaling one's opposition to the current president—was born. Fans say it at sports gatherings. Conservatives tweet it at each other. Even Republican politicians are getting in on it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) has been known to say it. So what? Well, even though it...

When it comes to the former group, we know with confidence, the chance they get re-infected and severely ill is very very low, and far lower than people who have not yet had and recovered from COVID19 (this is called natural immunity). The data in support of this is massive, and quite certain. Antibody data is...

That's one reason why President Biden said he wanted to limit the duration of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. On Thursday, this regional affiliate of the Islamic State struck at the heart of Kabul, setting off an explosion outside Hamid Karzai International Airport and another at the nearby Baron Hotel. The attacks killed dozens of Afghan civilians and at least 13 U.S. service members. Here's what is known about the group, which reportedly has claimed responsibility for Thursday's bombings: What...

__label__5 Conspicuously missing in Facebook whistleblower dumps is any hint of worry about left-wing hate and liesOPINIONAs whistleblowers continue to dump documents revealing internal Facebook discussions about controlling content, one thing is striking: The thousands of pages released so far contain zero signs of staff worries about (or even awareness of) left-wing hate speech and misinformation. Perhaps we’re only seeing part of the picture. But Facebook staffers’ incessant drive to censor right-wing stories and sites suggests they really are blind to the often-outrageous speech from outlets on the other side of the spectrum. The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster report this week detailed how the social-media giant’s “employees have consistently pushed to suppress or de-platform...
__label__3 Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Sri Lanka BombingsSri Lanka’s government says it has information the bombers were reacting to last month’s terrorist attack on mosques in New Zealand Terrorist group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated Easter bombings of churches and hotels that killed more than 300 people in Sri Lanka, as investigators worked to identify links with local militants who officials believe helped carry out the attacks. “The executors of the attack that targeted citizens of coalition states and Christians in Sri Lanka two days ago were Islamic State fighters,” Islamic State said in a...
__label__1 The Void That Critical Race Theory Was Created to FillOPINIONIn 1971, Derrick Bell, a forty-year-old civil-rights attorney, became the first Black professor to gain tenure at Harvard Law School. A soft-spoken and prolific scholar, with glasses and a short fro coming to a widow’s peak, Bell was a Pittsburgh native and Air Force veteran who, before his career in academia, had worked with Thurgood Marshall composing legal strategies against school segregation in the South, at the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, and as the deputy director of civil rights at the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. At Harvard,...
__label__5 Legacy Media Fuels Corporate Wokeness But Will Always Choose Wokeness Over CorporationsOPINIONThere’s a misconception that legacy media is an arm of the Democratic Party. There’s also a misconception that legacy media is pro-corporate. It’s true that legacy media is almost always pro-Democrat and almost always pro-corporate. But last week’s Netflix dust-up clarified something important. In recent weeks, Matt Taibbi and Katie Herzog have documented the egregiously bad coverage of Netflix’s internal turmoil over “The Closer,” Dave Chappelle’s latest special for the streamer. Journalists cheered the company’s pro-trans troublemakers with coverage that ranged from deeply misleading to outright false. This isn’t downstream of conspiracies in smoke-filled...
__label__3 U.S., Afghan Forces Launch Major Offensive Against Islamic StateU.S. and Afghan special-operations troops are carrying out a major air and ground offensive to clear Islamic State fighters from a district where the militant group aspires to make its local capital. The operation, launched unannounced at the end of last month, has killed some 140 Islamic State fighters in Deh Bala district, according to the U.S. military.
__label__2 John Oliver Makes One Of The Most Compelling Cases Yet For ReparationsANALYSISJohn Oliver on Sunday night pushed for reparations for Black Americans. “We’re not actually talking about reparations for slavery here. We should, but that is a different conversation,” he said. “We’re talking about housing discrimination.”  Homeownership, he pointed out, has been so defined by racism that many communities still have laws that forbid the sale of homes to people of color. And entire communities are still living with the legacy of real estate tactics from a not-too-distant past, such as redlining, blockbusting and overt discrimination in federal home loans. “The only...
__label__5 Washington Post fact-checker calls asking about Biden visiting the border 'a bit of a gotcha question'Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler seemed to dismiss the ongoing inquires of whether or not President Biden has gone to the southern border and if he has any intention of visiting in the future.  Biden raised eyebrows on Thursday at CNN's town hall when he was asked by an attendee why he hadn't been to the southern border as president.  He responded by saying he had "been there before" but admitted "I guess I should go down" before pointing to his busy schedule that has prevented the visit and touting a trip to the border...

__label__1 Apple Has a Growing Homeless Encampment on Its PropertyApple has committed billions of dollars to fixing California’s housing crisis. But clusters of homeless people living in dilapidated RVs, shacks, and tents have taken over dozens of acres of undeveloped land owned by the company in the center of Silicon Valley. There’s even dumpsters and porta-potties.  Anywhere from 30 to 100 homeless people have coalesced on the property owned by the iPhone-maker in North San Jose, according to local sources and residents. The area covers about 55 acres, KPIX, a local CBS affiliate, reported. Some current residents of the site, which has grown...
__label__5 CNN's Brian Stelter hosts segment calling for reporters to cover Republicans differently than DemocratsL.A. Times columnist claimed Republicans don’t care if the government works well. CNN’s Brian Stelter invited Los Angeles Times columnist Jackie Calmes on his weekly media program on Sunday to declare that journalists need to stop covering the country's two political parties equally because the modern Republicans don't "really care if government works well." "I want to dive right into your argument about what both-siderism is and why it’s failing the public,"Stelter said of Calmes, whose column on the subject won praise from liberal journalists. "Is it that we're treating Democrats and Republicans equally...

__label__2 How Tucker Carlson became the voice of White grievanceOPINIONTucker Carlson huddled in a low-ceilinged dungeon that had served as a holding pen for Africans bound for enslavement in the United States. It was a July day in 2003 in Ghana, and Carlson stood alongside some of America’s most prominent civil rights leaders. The conservative commentator, who at the time co-hosted the CNN show “Crossfire,” walked through the memorial, where a guide told how the shackled Africans who did not perish during the voyage were sold as human chattel in America. The civil rights leaders prayed, cried and sang...
__label__5 CNN Fact Checks Biden’s Town Hall But Neglects Claim That Multi-Trillion-Dollar Agenda Will Cost $0President Joe Biden made some false claims at his town hall with moderator Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, prompting the CNN Newsroom to fact check a few of his statements. Responding to concerns about the southern border Biden stated, “I’ve been there before. I know it well.”  Later, he conceded, “I guess I should go down but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole lot of time to get down.”   CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale pushed back against this claim, stating that he “could not find any...

__label__1 How the rich avoid paying taxesANALYSISIn the US, most people make their money from a regular job; they get a paycheck and pay income taxes. But the richest Americans, the top 1 percent, make most of their money from things like investments in real estate or the stock market. Those investments are taxed as capital gains. While federal income tax has a maximum tax rate of 37 percent, the tax rate for capital gains tops out at just 20 percent. It’s why Warren Buffett, one of the richest people in America, has often said that...
__label__5 COVID-19 Hospitalizations Rising In North, Falling In South, And The Media Is SilentANALYSISThe states with falling COVID-19 hospitalizations are mostly in the south, and the states with rising hospitalizations are mostly in the north. All the while, the media is ignoring the change, when they spent all summer blasting Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Greg Abbott (R-TX) for supposedly mishandling the pandemic. National Review’s Jim Geraghty noted the trend on Thursday, while pointing out that just “four states had double-digit percentage increases in the COVID-19 hospitalization rate.” That would be Michigan and New Hampshire, each with a 25% increase in hospitalizations over the past...
__label__3 Jake Sullivan discussed Saudi-Israel normalization with MBSWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised normalization with Israel during his recent meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, three U.S. and Arab sources tell Axios. Why it matters: Saudi Arabia would be the biggest regional player to sign onto the "Abraham Accords" peace agreement with Israel, and such a major breakthrough would likely convince other Arab and Muslim countries to follow suit. Behind the scenes: During the Sept. 27 meeting in Neom, a futuristic planned city on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast, Sullivan raised the issue and bin...
__label__2 When Your Body Counts But Your Vote Does Not: How Prison Gerrymandering Distorts Political RepresentationANALYSISWhen Floyd Wilson first learned of the term “prison gerrymandering,” he’d already been incarcerated for more than 35 years. He was taking a college seminar in a prison in Graterford, Pennsylvania—the fourth of five correctional facilities he’s lived in over the decades. Wilson grew up in Southwest Philadelphia and was sentenced to life in prison in 1976 as a juvenile for first degree murder. In every U.S. census that’s taken place since his conviction, he learned that day in class, he’s been counted not as a Philadelphian but as a...
__label__5 CENSORED: ABC, CBS, NBC Spent an Entire Year Hiding Hunter, Aired Only 18 Minutes On His ScandalsOPINIONIt’s been exactly one year (October 14, 2020) since the New York Post published damning evidence of Hunter Biden’s corrupt dealings with Ukraine and President Joe Biden’s potential knowledge of his son’s activities. It’s also been a year of  ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows largely censoring the myriad number of Hunter Biden scandals that have been revealed since then.  MRC analysts looked at the broadcast evening news programs from October 14, 2020 to October 13, 2021 and found ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News spent a measly 18 minutes, 4 seconds on all of...

About four years ago, the co-founder of the iconic ice cream maker, Ben & Jerry’s, had a chance encounter with Palestinian American activist Wafic Faour at the EDGE Sports & Fitness center in Williston, Vermont. Faour, a member of the Vermonters for Justice in Palestine, had been pressing the ice cream company for years to boycott Israel. He confronted Greenfield as he was leaving the gym about his company’s ongoing operations in occupied Palestinian lands. Greenfield replied his...
__label__1 Women Are Having Fewer Babies Because They Have More ChoicesOPINIONAmerican women are having fewer children and having them later than ever before — a demographic shift being met with significant consternation from the left and right alike.For conservatives, the fact that more women are putting off parenthood or forgoing it entirely is evidence of a dangerous decline in traditional family values. In this framing, women have been manipulated into putting their educational and professional aspirations ahead of motherhood, contributing to a broader cultural breakdown.

This week, we examine calls for the mainstream media to be more critical of Republicans, analyze the media’s coverage of the death of Colin Powell, and highlight more media misses. Journalists are Telling on Themselves Reporters from several mainstream-media outlets outed themselves as biased conduits of information over the weekend when they excitedly promoted a Los Angeles Times column that argued journalists are “failing the public with ‘both-siderism’ in political coverage.” Columnist Jackie Calmes laments how “journalist pressure” to be balanced...
__label__3 Israel launches maximum pressure campaign against Ben & Jerry'sThe Israeli government has formed a special task force to pressure Ben & Jerry's ice cream and its parent company Unilever to reverse their decision to boycott Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Israeli officials tell me. Why it matters: The Israeli government is concerned the move by Ben & Jerry's will encourage other international companies to take similar steps to differentiate between Israel and the West Bank settlements. A classified Foreign Ministry cable, seen by Axios, makes clear the government wants to send a message. Driving the news: Last week, Ben & Jerry's...
__label__2 Democrats cite Ku Klux Klan Act in suits over ‘Trump Train’ Texas bus incidentA convoy of Trump supporters that swarmed a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a Texas highway last October violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibits violent election intimidation, two new lawsuits allege. One suit targets drivers in the self-described “Trump Train”, saying they conspired to intimidate and harass Biden-Harris campaigners. The other suit names as defendants law enforcement officials in San Marcos, Texas, saying they “abdicated” their responsibility to protect the bus “despite repeated calls for help”. The lawsuits were filed by Eric Cervini, an author and volunteer; Wendy Davis, a former Texas state...

In the network evening news show coverage of stories about the infrastructure bill, increasing the debt ceiling and President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” spending boondoggle Republican voices were almost completely shut out.  MRC analysts looked at 30 stories on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening programs covering the most recent budget debates from September 23 to October 10 and discovered a whopping disparity in soundbites with Democrats overwhelming...
__label__3 Israel Hits Hamas Targets With The First Airstrikes Since Cease-Fire DealOvernight, tensions between Israel and Hamas erupted into violence, posing a potential threat to the brief period of peace reached between the two just weeks ago. Israeli jets struck two targets in Gaza early Wednesday. In a tweet, which included a video of the attack, the Israel Defense Forces said its "fighter jets struck Hamas military compounds last night, which were used as meeting sites for Hamas terror operatives. Hamas will bear the consequences for its actions." The IDF said it's "prepared for any scenario, including a resumption of hostilities, in the face...

A perusal of the company’s website reveals hundreds of such items for sale, like a Queer Eye-branded clothing line and tie-ins from rainbow-themed brands like Skittles and the Kellogg Company. You can even buy a shirt that reads: “I can’t even think straight.” Walmart earned a perfect 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, which scores companies based on their support of LGBTQ employees through HR policies,...
__label__5 Katie Couric withheld Justice Ginsburg’s opposition to racial justice protesters taking a kneeKatie Couric intentionally withheld the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dislike for people who take a knee in protest of racial justice during the national anthem, according to reports from Ms. Couric’s new memoir out later this month. The journalist admitted to trying to “protect” Ginsburg by editing out comments she made about the kneeling controversy during a 2016 interview that Ms. Couric, a former host of NBC’s “Today” show, was doing for Yahoo News. In the article, Ginsburg is quoted saying that taking a knee is “dumb...
__label__3 Jewish Democrats clash with Ilhan Omar after comments on U.S. and IsraelA group of Jewish Democrats in the House is publicly feuding with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) after she tweeted about "unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban," in reference to investigations by the International Criminal Court. Why it matters: The fight threatens to reopen a fault line within the party that could cost Omar her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, writes Punchbowl News. The House previously passed a resolution by Democrats condemning anti-Semitism in response to comments on Israel by Omar, and Republicans have long accused the Minnesota congresswoman...
__label__2 Pentagon prepared for ‘mass casualty’ attack at Kabul Airport hours before explosionJust 24 hours before a suicide bomber detonated an explosive outside Hamid Karzai International Airport, senior military leaders gathered for the Pentagon’s daily morning update on the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. Speaking from a secure video conference room on the third floor of the Pentagon at 8 a.m. Wednesday — or 4:30 p.m. in Kabul — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instructed more than a dozen of the department’s top leaders around the world to make preparations for an imminent “mass casualty event,” according to classified detailed notes of the gathering...
__label__5 The New York Times Spreads Misinformation About COVID-19ANALYSISThe purported threat of social media has emerged once again as a top concern of senators, whistleblowers, and members of the press. They are very, very worried about Facebook fanning the flames of hate, compromising U.S. democracy, and spreading COVID misinformation. How many of them are worried about the COVID misinformation being spread by The New York Times? The paper of record had to print a lengthy correction to a big error in a Thursday news article. The story was about other countries' approaches to vaccinating young people, and whether one shot would be better than...

__label__2 An American ISIS Fighter Describes The Caliphate's Final Days — And His OwnI'd been communicating with Russell Dennison almost daily for more than six months when his messages suddenly stopped coming. Dennison was a devout Muslim. He believed the time and place of his death were predetermined, that if a bomb were meant for him, it would kill him, regardless of anything he might do to avoid it. That bomb found him in the spring of 2019 in Baghuz, a small village in eastern Syria near the border with Iraq. I learned of his death months later, after a witness told Dennison’s Syrian...
__label__4 NYT Issues Major Correction After Claiming 900,000 Kids Have Been Hospitalized With COVIDThe New York Times (NYT) issued a correction Thursday after overstating the number of kids who have been hospitalized in the U.S. with the coronavirus. The article, originally published Wednesday, discussed COVID-19 cases among children. “Nearly 900,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since the pandemic began, and about 520 have died,” NYT reporter Apoorva Mandavilli initially wrote. An updated correction said the original publication “misstated the number of Covid hospitalizations in U.S. children. It is more than 63,000 from August 2020 to October 2021, not 900,000 since the beginning of the pandemic.”...
__label__3 Israel to ask U.S. for $1 billion in emergency military aidIsrael will ask the U.S. for $1 billion in additional emergency military aid this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told "Fox and Friends" on Tuesday and Israeli officials confirmed. Why it matters: Israeli officials say the aid is needed to replenish the Iron Dome aerial defense system and to purchase munitions for the Israeli air force — mainly precision-guided bombs. But several congressional Democrats have argued against providing additional weapons to Israel after at least 256 Palestinians were killed during last month's fighting in the Gaza Strip, mainly by Israeli airstrikes....
__label__2 US counterterrorism operations touched 85 countries in the last 3 years aloneNearly 20 months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President George W. Bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a giant “Mission Accomplished” banner and declared “major combat operations in Iraq have ended.” Nearly 18 years later, the U.S. is still entangled in military action in the Middle East and beyond. After the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11, much of the U.S. military activity has been focused on counterterrorism efforts, either in direct combat, through drone attacks, border patrols, intelligence gathering or training other nations' security forces.  These...
__label__5 Journalists Face Disaster as COVID-19 Deaths DropOPINIONThe COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. is ebbing, but you would never know it from the headlines. Bad news, accurate or not, sells. And in the case of COVID-19, it also supports the journalists’ prejudices. The seven-day moving average of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations peaked and started to decline in early September. Nationwide, COVID-19 hospitalization rates have decreased 17 percent over the past two weeks. Only 19 states had any increase, and many were small. The remaining 31 states and the District of Columbia saw hospitalization rates decline. But that hasn’t stopped journalists from...
__label__3 Bennett to announce he's joining opposition to form new Israeli government, oust NetanyahuThe leader of right-wing Yamina party Naftali Bennett could announce as early as Sunday that he is joining opposition leader Yair Lapid to form a power-sharing government in Israel, sources familiar with the issue tell Axios. Why it matters: If a new "change government" will be formed, Bennett will be prime minister and will bring an end to 12 years of Benjamin Netanyahu rule. Such a development could end the political crisis that led to four consecutive elections in two years. Flashback: Three weeks ago, Lapid was on the verge of forming...

Trump picked the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks to honor Sgt. Maj.

I tried for a year to reach someone at Facebook to fix things, but Facebook wouldn’t. Here’s the problem: Facebook uses “independent fact-checkers” to try to reduce fake news on its site. That’s a noble goal. Unfortunately, at least one Facebook “fact-checker” is a climate-alarmist group that cleverly uses its Facebook connections to stop debate. Facebook is a private company. It has every right to cut me off. But Facebook does not have the right to just lie...
__label__3 Evictions of Palestinians could spark further conflict, Blinken warnsSecretary of State Tony Blinken warned Israeli leaders on his visit to Jerusalem this week that evictions of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem or further unrest on the Temple Mount could spark renewed “tension, conflict and war," he told me in a phone interview. What he’s saying: Speaking on his flight back from the Middle East, Blinken said the most important aspect of his trip was that he heard directly from Israel and indirectly from Hamas, through Egypt, that both want to maintain the ceasefire. “But it's also important that...
__label__2 Trump to announce further reduction in US troops in IraqUnited States President Donald Trump will announce a further withdrawal of US troops from Iraq on Wednesday, according to a senior administration official, as he faces a backlash from reports that he allegedly insulted American veterans and war dead.He will also announce an additional reduction in US forces in Afghanistan, the official said.Trump is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the November 3 election.
__label__4 The Age of Progressive MisinformationOPINIONHow does a stupid and ridiculous lie come to be embraced and promulgated by top officials of the United States government? Well, as it turns out, it’s easy. You start with an easily misinterpreted news photo that seemingly confirms progressive opponents’ assumption about immigration enforcement: that the agents policing our southern border are cruel racists. Then you work up a Twitter mob saying that the photo has captured a tableau of hideous abuse. You add open-borders advocacy organizations and civil-rights groups denouncing the supposed misconduct in the harshest possible terms.
__label__3 Jewish House Democrats call for Biden to address antisemitismA group of Jewish House Democrats are calling on President Biden to take concrete steps to address antisemitism amid a sharp rise in attacks against Jews in the U.S. and abroad, which is occurring alongside the most recent conflict in the Middle East.  In a letter sent Wednesday to the president, four lawmakers condemn rhetoric from both the Republican and Democratic parties and demand a “united, bipartisan, national-level commitment to confront and address the threat of antisemitism head-on.” The letter was signed by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Elaine Luria (D-Va.), Kathy Manning (D-N.C.) and Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) — who are...
__label__1 Pentagon identifies Marines killed in 'intense' clash with ISIS fighters in IraqThe Pentagon has identified two US Marines who were killed in Iraq on Sunday in what is being called one of the "most intense" battles US forces have been involved in recent months, according to the US-led coalition. Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Diego D. Pongo, 34, of Simi Valley, California, and Capt. Moises A. Navas, 34, of Germantown, Maryland, were killed in a joint Iraqi-US helicopter assault on a suspected ISIS-occupied cave complex in the Makhmur Mountains of northern Iraq. "This was one of the most intense clashes with...
__label__5 The Antisocial NetworkOPINIONSome years ago, in a typical attempt to make his point in the most cringe-inducing manner possible, Barack Obama defended the American immigration system on the grounds that, as he put it, “Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.” I’m not actually going to suggest that we deport Mike Krieger, the Brazilian immigrant in question who co-founded Instagram with a friend at Stanford University. (Though if, instead of a billionaire who sold a technology company that allows Kim Kardashian to sell...
__label__3 Senate Republicans introduce bill to resupply Israel's Iron DomeFour Senate Republicans, Marco Rubio (FL), Bill Hagerty (TN), Tom Cotton (AR), and Ted Cruz (TX) introduced on Friday a new bill aimed to resupply Israel with missile defense interceptors. The “Emergency Resupply for Iron Dome Act of 2021” will authorize the Executive Branch “to redirect US foreign assistance to help Israel replenish its highly-effective missile defense interceptors.” “Iranian-backed terrorists have launched thousands of rockets targeting innocent civilians in Israel,” Rubio said in a statement. “Their hate for Israel has also resulted in misfires that have killed their own people in...
__label__2 Erdogan, Putin announce Idlib ceasefire after Moscow meetingTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have announced a ceasefire in Idlib to begin at midnight on Thursday, after a meeting in Moscow that lasted six hours.Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria, has witnessed increased violence and bloodshed since last December, the start of a fresh Russia-backed Syrian offensive to regain control over the region, resulting in Turkey sending thousands of troops into the province to repel the Syrian army.
__label__5 ‘Fact Checks’ by Non-Experts Are Shutting Down Genuine Scientific InquiryOPINIONWe recently published a new climate change report in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA). The nearly two dozen co-authors of our paper are experts in solar physics and climate science from 14 countries. We were looking at the role of the Sun in climate change. We found that, depending on which scientific datasets you choose, you could explain the global warming since the 19th century as being anything from mostly natural to mostly human-caused. The huge uncertainty over such a key question is a major concern. A few days after...
__label__3 U.S. Jews have widely differing views on IsraelDATAIsrael, the world’s only Jewish-majority country, is a subject of special concern to many Jews in the United States. Caring about Israel is “essential” to what being Jewish means to 45% of U.S. Jewish adults, and an additional 37% say it is “important, but not essential,” according to a new Pew Research Center survey that was fielded from Nov. 19, 2019, to June 3, 2020 – well before the latest surge of violence in the region. Just 16% of U.S. Jewish adults say that caring about Israel is “not important” to their Jewish...
__label__2 Trump Says the U.S. Has Destroyed ‘100% of ISIS.’ It Hasn’t.President Donald Trump made a number of eyebrow-raising claims during Wednesday’s address to the nation on the latest tensions in the Middle East — but perhaps none more so than his assertion that the U.S. had destroyed “100 percent of ISIS.” Near the end of his 10-minute address from the White House, responding to Iran’s missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq, Trump claimed the U.S. had destroyed “100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate” in Iraq and Syria. But experts say that’s a misrepresentation of the situation. While...
__label__5 Politico Finally Acknowledges That Major Portions Of Hunter Biden Story Have Been Verified, Something Conservative Outlets Reported Long AgoANALYSISPolitico has finally acknowledged that major aspects of the Hunter Biden story suppressed by social media outlets ahead of the 2020 election were, in fact, true. The admission comes nearly a month after conservative media outlets reported the same thing, yet the Politico acknowledgment will be seen by other left-leaning media outlets as the necessary verification. Calling it “First in Playbook,” Politico plugged Ben Schreckinger’s newly released book, “The Bidens: Inside the First Family’s Fifty-Year Rise to Power,” which included evidence verifying reporting from the New York Post and other right-leaning outlets....
__label__3 When Gaza guns fall silent, will new path to peace emerge?It has been over 20 years since the U.S. was last involved in a serious effort to resolve the Palestinian issue. The current fighting between Israel and Hamas might – just possibly – prompt Washington to try again. Sadly, we’ve been here before: the militant Islamist Hamas movement in Gaza, on Israel’s southern border, firing missiles at Israeli towns and cities, Israel responding with overwhelming force, hundreds of innocent civilian lives lost, mostly Palestinian. But while the military equation hasn’t changed, the political context has. A critically important paradox lies...
__label__2 How Do You Counter Extremism? New Start Up Redirects ISIS and White Supremacists.The top 20 search terms used by those in the United States seeking white supremacist material online last year started with “RaHoWa,” short for Racial Holy War and the name of a white power band. Then came “Ku Klux Klan phone number.” Phrases like “how to kill blacks” or “swastika tattoo” fill most of the list. Amid an upsurge in violent hate attacks, federal law enforcement agencies and other groups have been scrutinizing online activity like internet searches to counteract radicalization. Now a private start-up company has developed an unusual...
__label__5 The Media Imagine a Scientific Consensus on Student Mask MandatesOPINION“The scientific research is conclusive: Widespread masking in schools significantly limits COVID transmission among students,” tweeted NPR while promoting its story “Yes, Gov. DeSantis, Studies Do Show Masks Curb Covid-19 In Schools.” According to its author, the “still raging” political debate over whether masks should be required in schools ignores the “scientific consensus” — which purportedly holds that K–12 student mask mandates are invaluable. To buttress this claim, the author cites a few studies suggesting that masks have been effective in mitigating spread of the virus while completely ignoring those that indicate the opposite....
__label__3 Are Israel, Hamas committing war crimes in Gaza?More than a week into their fourth war, Israel and the Hamas militant group already face allegations of possible war crimes in Gaza. Israel says Hamas is using Palestinian civilians as human shields, while critics say Israel is using disproportionate force. Who’s right? It’s hard to say, especially in the fog of battle. The firing of hundreds of imprecise rockets into Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian groups is fairly clear-cut. International law prohibits targeting civilians or using indiscriminate force in civilian areas. Rockets slamming into Tel Aviv apartment blocks...
__label__2 Pentagon reveals details, video of fast, violent raid that killed ISIS leader BaghdadiWASHINGTON – The Pentagon released details and graphic footage Wednesday of the secret raid that killed ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend. Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the four-star chief of Central Command who oversaw the operation, said the raid on Oct. 25 killed six ISIS fighters, including Bagdhadi.

__label__4 Google Is Teaching Employees That Listening To Ben Shapiro Leads To ‘Genocide’ANALYSISThe tech giant Google is holding “antiracist” training for its employees that claims a direct link exists between listening to Ben Shapiro, editor emeritus of The Daily Wire and host of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” and committing “mass murder.” The training also places former President Donald Trump on a list of ideas and people that lead to “genocide,” along with “apolitical beliefs” and phrases such as “All Lives Matter.” Shapiro, Trump, and the rest all contribute to the “normalization” of racism that eventually inspires mass shooters and leads to the...
__label__3 In Israel-Hamas Conflict, Washington Finds It Hard to Say ‘Cease- Fire’When violence breaks out in international hot spots, the typical U.S. response has been an immediate, forceful call for a cease-fire, and a demand that the combatants settle differences through negotiations. When it came to the current flare up between Israelis and Palestinians, President Biden took more than a week to make such a call. Even then, the White House was more cautious than in the past. The president only went so far as to say he “supported” a cease-fire, a statement that the administration’s critics saw as weak, especially...
__label__1 Intelligence From al-Baghdadi Raid, Including 2 Prisoners, Could Reveal Trove of ISIS CluesWASHINGTON — Delta Force commandos took two Islamic State fighters as prisoners and a trove of intelligence from the now-destroyed compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world’s most wanted terrorist, had been hiding, officials said Monday. The prisoners, who are being held in Iraq, are being questioned by the United States military. If the Trump administration follows its previous practice with captured Islamic State fighters, the men will eventually be turned over to the Iraqi government for prosecution. Both the captives and the documents taken from the compound during a...
__label__5 CNNLOL Ignores Bombshell Report About Lab Funding in Interview with Anthony FauciOPINIONCNN, a far-left propaganda outlet that encourages violence against Trump supporters, obtained an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci and — just as everyone would expect from this crooked outlet — didn’t ask about a bombshell report that could very well get him in some perjury trouble with the U.S. Senate. For those wondering why, during a month of huge news — Afghanistan, hurricanes, etc. — this garbage pile of a news outlet still can’t average even a measly million primetime viewers, this is why.

__label__3 Can US be honest broker in Israeli-Palestinian conflict?The eruption of Israeli-Palestinian violence is raising pressure on the U.S. to return to a traditional role in that conflict – that of powerful mediator. What does the goal of “honest broker” mean today? As the deadly exchanges of rocket fire and airstrikes between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered their second week Monday, the White House issued a statement in which for the first time President Joe Biden expressed his support for a “cease-fire” in the hostilities. But as if to rule out any doubts about where Mr. Biden...
__label__1 At a sprawling tent camp in Syria, ISIS women impose a brutal ruleAL-HOL, Syria — The woman told aid workers it was an accident. Her 14-year-old daughter had slipped and fallen, she said. There was nothing they could have done. But the body told a different story. The girl’s neck had been broken in three places, doctors said, and she died with eyes open, biting her lips and struggling to breathe. Photos and medical records suggested she had been beaten about the torso, then strangled. It was murder, not a misstep. The teen, an Azerbaijani girl who had lived until earlier this...
__label__5 The Media Fell for a Viral Hoax About Ivermectin Overdoses Straining Rural HospitalsANALYSISKFOR, an Oklahoma news channel, reported last week that rural hospitals throughout the state were in danger of becoming overwhelmed by victims of a very specific poisoning: overdoses of ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug promoted by vaccine skeptics as a possible treatment for COVID-19. The story went viral, and was seized upon by the mainstream media. But its central claim is substantially untrue. The meat of the story is a series of quotes from an Oklahoma doctor, Jason McElyea, who appears to attribute overcrowding at local hospitals to a deluge of ivermectin overdoses....

__label__5 USA Today Bungles Fact Check On Biden Checking WatchA USA Today fact check about President Joe Biden checking his watch during a dignified transfer of military remains has been amended from “partly false” to “missing context.” Fact-checker Daniel Funke posted the original check Wednesday after photos were released which appeared to show Biden checking his watch during the solemn ceremony at Dover Air Force Base after 13 American troops were killed in the Kabul airport bombing. Funke labeled the claim that Biden checked his watch “misleading,” arguing that Biden had properly honored the fallen soldiers and only checked his watch after...
__label__3 Biden Can’t Claim ‘Moral Leadership’ While Sanctioning the ICCOPINIONIn his Feb. 4 foreign-policy address, U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to make human rights and multilateralism cornerstones of his approach to global affairs. But that’s a pledge he appears to have forgotten just a day later, on Feb. 5, when the pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has the authority to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the West Bank and Gaza Strip—by Israeli and Palestinian personnel alike. Biden’s State Department immediately criticized the court’s scrutiny of...

The book, Gender Queer: A Memoir, a graphic novel by author Maia Kobabe, has become something of a symbol of what's at stake in the educational culture wars both in the Virginia gubernatorial election and beyond. Published by Simon and Schuster, the book has won numerous awards. The book...

Driving the news: In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring another during protests against police last summer.

__label__4 Legacy Media Fuels Corporate Wokeness But Will Always Choose Wokeness Over CorporationsOPINIONThere’s a misconception that legacy media is an arm of the Democratic Party. There’s also a misconception that legacy media is pro-corporate. It’s true that legacy media is almost always pro-Democrat and almost always pro-corporate. But last week’s Netflix dust-up clarified something important. In recent weeks, Matt Taibbi and Katie Herzog have documented the egregiously bad coverage of Netflix’s internal turmoil over “The Closer,” Dave Chappelle’s latest special for the streamer. Journalists cheered the company’s pro-trans troublemakers with coverage that ranged from deeply misleading to outright false. This isn’t downstream of conspiracies in smoke-filled...

Ron DeSantis reaffirmed his state’s commitment to election integrity on Tuesday, especially keeping tech giants and their partisan CEOs from corrupting local elections. Given what we know now about how Mark Zuckerberg and other left-wing actors commandeered election operations in blue hubs of swing states in 2020, other states would do well to follow DeSantis’s lead — and Wisconsin...

Why it matters: Avenatti was once considered a rising Democratic star and a potential 2020 candidate before facing extortion, fraud and tax charges.

Until 2018, the stone building housed the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem and America’s diplomatic mission to the Palestinians. But the Trump administration closed it down and merged it into the new U.S. Embassy in the city, Israel's capital.  It sent a clear message: Relations with the Palestinians had been reduced to a portfolio within the American-Israeli relationship.

__label__3 Community-rooted economic inclusion: A strategic action playbookANALYSISThe United States is characterized by a persistent geography of racial and economic injustice, in which people of color and low-income people are concentrated in underinvested neighborhoods and systematically isolated from the resources, amenities, and opportunities needed to thrive. COVID-19 has magnified the harms of this enduring intersection between race, poverty, and place—literally killing people in real time for living in racially and economically segregated neighborhoods—but it only shined new light on systems that have long been broken.

Now, finally, the reign of “King Bibi” — a moniker earned by his lengthy stay in office and authoritarian inclinations — has come to an end. On Sunday, Netanyahu’s opponents in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, voted to replace him with a “change” coalition: a group of diverse parties from across the Israeli political spectrum united only by their interest in pushing Netanyahu out. The new prime minister is Naftali Bennett, from...

Why it matters: It's an extra layer of protection for Durham to continue investigating possible misconduct by Obama-era intelligence officials past Joe Biden's inauguration as president. The big picture: President Trump and his allies have long predicted that Durham's investigation would lead to the indictments of high-level Obama administration...

The pair of leaders would also, hopefully, discuss migration and new COVID-19 vaccine donations from the U.S., AMLO said. “I have a call today with Vice President Kamala Harris. We are going to give continuity to the agenda that we have in common on migration issues, of course, the issue of opening the border, the support that they have been giving us, and that...
__label__3 Explainer: Can Trump's lawyers be disciplined for making false claims?ANALYSISIn the weeks since U.S. President Donald Trump lost the election, his lead lawyer Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly made baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and the campaign brought a flurry of lawsuits challenging the results, many of which were dismissed. Representative Bill Pascrell, a Democrat, on Friday called for Giuliani and other members of the legal team to be stripped of their law licenses for bringing “frivolous” lawsuits and allegedly attempting to help Republican Trump steal the Nov. 3 vote from President-elect Joe Biden. But legal ethics experts say...
__label__1 U.S. tech giants’ vise over Israel tightens despite ceasefireThe aftermath of this month’s violence in the Gaza Strip is deepening the pressure on Google, Amazon and Facebook to reexamine their close ties to Israel — an effort that comes amid a broader reckoning over the militarization of the U.S. tech industry. Tech employees who previously pressured the corporate behemoths into dropping projects with the Pentagon and China are strategizing with outside activists over the best way to agitate against cloud contracts with the Israeli government. They’re considering a range of options, including cajoling shareholders and circulating letters to...
__label__5 Hunter Biden's laptop reportedly reveals photos of then-VP Joe Biden meeting with son's Mexican billionaire business associatesANALYSISAnother concerning accusation that Joe Biden had a cozy relationship with Hunter Biden's overseas business associates has surfaced. The latest allegation claims that Joe Biden, when he was vice president, had direct contact with his son's billionaire business associates from Mexico, according to content reportedly discovered on Hunter's laptop that was abandoned at a computer repair shop. Since at least 2010, Hunter Biden's associates had been planning on working with Carlos Slim, who was the richest person in the world at the time. The plans for working with the richest person in the world...
__label__3 Athletes have taken social stands before. Why this time is different.ANALYSISIn a contest that was coming down to the wire, it was only natural to turn to an athlete who was famous for coming through in the clutch. The competition was the 1990 Senate race in North Carolina, a heated, racially divisive match between Harvey Gantt, a Democrat and the first African American mayor of Charlotte, and the longtime Republican incumbent, Jesse Helms, a pillar of the ultraconservative wing of the party. A famously staunch segregationist, Mr. Helms had strongly opposed the movement to create a national holiday in honor...
__label__1 In defense of the two-state solutionANALYSISSome are declaring the two-state paradigm for Israel and Palestine totally doomed. But it’s not — and it’s still worth fighting for. Last week, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in a conflict that claimed nearly 250 lives. But the underlying status quo makes another round of fighting all but inevitable, and a fundamental solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems further away than ever. Worse, the long-running American solution for the problem — a US-mediated peace process aimed at creating a “two-state solution,” with an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside...
__label__5 FBI Director: Mexican Cartel Violence and Power Is Spilling Into the U.S.Testifying  in front of the House Judiciary Committee this week, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that a chaotic, open border is leading to cartel control in the United States.  "Is it true that many of the foreign nationals who are being trafficked across our border often arrive here deeply indebted to the Mexican crime cartels?" Republican Congressman Tom McClintock asked. "Are those debts collected through indentured servitude to the cartels?" "Certainly we have seen quite a number of such instances, absolutely," Wray said, adding the situation is extremely disturbing. "There...
__label__3 Judge Tosses Out Michael Cohen’s Bid For Trump Organization To Pay His Legal BillsA state court in Manhattan will not require the Trump Organization to reimburse former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for millions of dollars in legal expenses, a judge ruled Friday, dismissing a years-old lawsuit filed by the Trump loyalist-turned-antagonist. Manhattan Judge Joel Cohen dismissed Michael Cohen’s lawsuit with prejudice Friday. Cohen sued the Trump Organization in early 2019, alleging the company had promised to pay any legal bills he incurred for a slew of federal investigations into his work, but backed out of that agreement after Cohen began cooperating with investigators. But the judge concluded many...
__label__2 Why isn’t Biden pushing Israel harder?ANALYSISTo understand Biden’s Israel policy now, you have to look at his past. There’s a story Joe Biden likes to tell any time he speaks to an audience about Israel. It’s 1948, a matter of days before Israel’s founding and three years after the end of World War II. Six-year-old Joey Biden is at the dinner table with his family, listening to his Catholic father wonder aloud why some people wouldn’t want to recognize the state of Israel. That’s when his father uttered the words “never again,” making clear to young Joey that...
__label__5 FBI director confirms Mexico cartel activity 'spilling over' into US amid border crisisFBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday said there is "no question" that cartel activity from Mexico is "spilling over" into the U.S. – as the country faces a historic crisis at the southern border triggered by a massive surge in migration.Wray was asked at a House Judiciary Committee hearing by Rep.

__label__3 DOJ reviewing decision not to charge FBI agents in Nassar investigationThe Justice Department said Tuesday it is reviewing a previous decision not to charge FBI agents accused of mishandling the investigation into disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Why it matters: Less than a month ago, FBI director Christopher Wray formally apologized to the U.S. gymnasts abused by Nassar, noting that the FBI's failure to stop Nassar was "inexcusable." His apology came after four gymnasts — including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney — testified before the committee and detailed how the FBI mishandled their reports.

There’s at least one person between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River for whom gruesome recent events have worked out just fine: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two weeks ago, while tensions were already growing over the planned eviction of six families from a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem but before they were exacerbated by police raiding the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Israel’s longest-serving leader was in a jam. The inconclusive results of the country’s fourth election in...

__label__3 U.S. Justice Department says Missouri state gun law is unconstitutionalPresident Joe Biden's Justice Department is stepping up its fight against a new state law in Missouri that aims to invalidate many federal gun regulations, saying the measure has impeded law enforcement efforts to work with state and local police and is also unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a statement of interest in an ongoing lawsuit in Cole County, Missouri, saying the state's Second Amendment Preservation Act, also known as "HB85," should be declared unconstitutional and that the court should issue a injunction barring its enforcement.

__label__5 Biden Administration Silent After Ford Ditches Ohio For MexicoANALYSISFord announced it is moving a nearly $1 billion project from Ohio to Mexico, prompting criticism from a major labor union and silence from the Biden administration, which has pledged to invest in domestic union projects. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said he will be the most pro-union president in history by investing significant amounts of money in domestic infrastructure spending. The previous administration spoke out loudly against outsourcing in the automotive industry. In 2017, Ford canceled a multibillion-dollar investment project in Mexico and invested $1.2 billion in three Michigan...

__label__4 Biden adviser admits immigration policy 'may have driven' migrant surge, encouraged 'smugglers'Southern Border Coordinator Roberta Jacobson said Wednesday that it was not a "coincidence" border crossing attempts spiked after President Biden took office.

"There was a hope for a more humane policy after four years of pent-up demand, so I don't know if I would call...

__label__3 A Lawsuit Against Jan. 6 Rally Speakers Forces DOJ To Consider Who's Legally ImmuneA lawsuit against the men who spoke at a rally before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6 is putting the Justice Department in a tricky position. The department is considering whether those federal officials acted within the scope of their jobs that day, which would trigger a form of legal immunity. Government watchdogs said the case has serious implications for who's held accountable for violence that delayed the election certification and contributed to the deaths of five people. One of the defendants is Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, who...

The ship turned off its tracking system to avoid detection while entering Israeli waters, and turned it back on once in Syria a few days after the spill, she said. Most of Israel’s coastline has been affected by the spill,...

The report follows Attorney General Merrick Garland’s recent efforts to improve the Justice Department’s role in combating hate crimes and hate incidents.  Under four statutes in the U.S. Criminal Code, hate crimes are defined as crimes committed on the basis of a victim’s characteristics such as race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability. Most recently, reports of hate crimes targeting Asian...
__label__2 How the Media Cracks Down on Critics of IsraelOPINIONIt is widely recognized that critics of Israel, no matter how well-founded the criticism, are routinely punished by both public and private institutions for their speech. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has documented a pattern by which “those who seek to protest, boycott, or otherwise criticize the Israeli government are being silenced,” a trend that “manifests on college campuses, in state contracts, and even in bills to change federal criminal law” and “suppress[es] the speech of people on only one side of the Israel-Palestine debate.” The Center for Constitutional...
__label__5 Deported Parents Choosing Not to Be Reunited with Children, Holding Out Hope to Return to U.S.When the American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday submitted its most recent court filing on the status of children separated from their parents at the U.S. border, mainstream media focused on one number: 545, the number of kids whose parents still haven’t been located. Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden called it “criminal” during Thursday’s debate. President Donald Trump mostly dodged a question about how the families will be reunited. “We’re trying very hard,” he said, after first touting increased border security during his term. But there’s a couple of numbers...
__label__3 US Justice Department sues Georgia over election lawsThe Biden Justice Department has announced that it will sue the state of Georgia over new voting laws passed in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the laws were "enacted with the purpose of denying or abridging the right of black Georgians to vote". Republicans, who control Georgia's state legislature, say the restrictions streamline voting procedures. Mr Garland also issued a mandate to prosecute threats to election workers. It amounts to the first major action the Biden administration has taken in response to a wave...

__label__5 GOP Reps Call on Top Biden Admin Officials To Testify on Bungled Afghanistan WithdrawalA coalition of Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress is demanding that senior Biden administration officials appear on Capitol Hill to be questioned about the bungled U.S. exit from Afghanistan, which cost American lives and left hundreds of Americans stranded in the Taliban-controlled country. Rep.

__label__3 The Justice Department swears it’s all for a free press. Doesn’t seem that way.ANALYSISIn its dealings with the press these days, the Justice Department reminds me a little of Sir Lancelot in the movie “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” After slaughtering multiple wedding guests, he apologizes. “You only killed the bride’s father,” the groom’s father complains. “Well, I really didn’t mean to,” Lancelot answered. “Didn’t mean to? You put a sword right through his head.” And so here are officials of the Justice Department, which has continued to seize journalists’ records across multiple administrations, swearing they are all about “a free press”...

__label__4 GOP Lawmakers Concerned Biden Removed Sanctions To Appease IranA group of 33 Republican lawmakers launched an investigation on Thursday into the Biden administration’s decision to remove sanctions earlier this month on entities tied to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program. Congressional Republicans suspect the Biden Treasury Department’s decision is part of a package of concessions meant to entice Iran into resuming negotiations aimed at securing a return to the nuclear deal—though senior U.S. officials dispute this claim, saying that the sanctions were removed following an internal legal review. Diplomatic talks with Iran have stalled since the regime inaugurated a new...

__label__1 Ending Roe Could Send More Women to Prison for MiscarryingOPINIONThe number of women in prison has skyrocketed over the last 40 years. Despite critical state level criminal justice reforms designed to keep people out of prison, both sexes have not benefited equally. Women currently go to prison at twice the rate of men. And now, a new threat to the over-prosecution and incarceration of women looms large in the, perhaps, unexpected forum of reproductive rights. This year alone, state legislators have introduced nearly 600 abortion restrictions, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood. Some of these laws,...

Fifteen of the nominees -- more than a quarter of the total -- are African American, while 21% are Hispanic and 23% are Asian American or Pacific Islanders (AAPI), the official said.

__label__4 Biden Should Look to Israeli Airlifts to Bring Americans in Afghanistan HomeANALYSISIn the wake of the death of 13 American service members, President Biden has proudly hailed our exit from Afghanistan as “one of the biggest airlifts in history.” But, by Biden’s own account, while 5,500 Americans were exfiltrated, at least 100-200 Americans are still left behind. So, as great as that last airlift may have been, it looks like the Biden administration needs another one. To get these remaining Americans out, the Biden administration should be inspired by past rescue missions by Israel to save Jews from hostile lands. Assuming that the...
__label__3 We’re Tracking Trump’s And Harris’s Popularity Ahead Of The 2024 Presidential Election. (Yes, It’s Early.)ANALYSISFormer President Donald Trump ended his presidency more unpopular than any of the last 12 presidents at the end of their first terms and he is still unpopular post-presidency according to FiveThirtyEight’s new average of Trump’s favorability numbers. Currently, 41.4 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the former president, while 53 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.

Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, touched on this recently when she wrote about addiction stigma in STAT, noting that “societal norms surrounding drug use and addiction continue to be informed by myths and misconceptions.” Starting in the 1980s, a rowdy group of individuals began advocating for a different approach to drug policy called harm reduction. These activists, researchers, social workers, attorneys, and others, from...

While Trump Jr.’s claim that Harris herself hired the kids is incorrect, the claim that they are child actors is true.

__label__1 Why Trump Probably Won’t Be ChargedANALYSISFor those expecting or hoping to see Donald Trump wind up in prison, a great deal depends on whether this week’s charges are the opening salvo from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, the beginning of the end of the investigation, or something in between. Based on what we know right now, it is best to think of the future as a range of these possibilities. On Thursday, Cyrus Vance’s years-long investigation into the Trump Organization produced an indictment charging Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer, with a variety of crimes for not reporting...

Excerpts: So, alongside the billions for bombs went hundreds of millions for gender studies in Afghanistan. According to US government reports, $787 million was spent on gender programs in Afghanistan, but that substantially understates the actual total, since gender goals were folded into practically every undertaking...

__label__1 Zoom Court Is Changing How Justice Is ServedANALYSISIn july, Michelle Rick, then a circuit-court judge in two Michigan counties, tweeted cheerily about a divorce she’d recently finalized. The participants had appeared in court via their smartphones. “He was on the road & parked his car to attend; she video-tx’d from her work breakroom,” the judge wrote. They were done in 15 minutes—faster than the proverbial Reno divorce. Last spring, as COVID‑19 infections surged for the first time, many American courts curtailed their operations.

__label__3 Your public school kid's lunch might be served on a pizza slice box. Here's whyAmerican public school students are likely eating a lot more meals at school this year. School food has been free for lower-income kids and some entire districts in the past, and it has been available for purchase to other kids, sometimes at a reduced cost. School districts are responsible for their own programs and are then reimbursed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), primarily for the subsidized meals.

__label__2 Want to solve America's labor shortage? Hire immigrants and foreignersOPINIONThe U.S. war on immigrants is worsening the labor shortage. But some Americans would rather destroy the supply chain and shutter industries than admit it – and do something about it. Evidence of scarce workers is everywhere. Shipping containers remained unopened from Los Angeles to Georgia. Restaurants, hotels, trucking and other industries are begging for workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that “employers are struggling to fill more than 10 million job openings and meet soaring consumer demand.” Industries hardest hit by a record number of workers quitting include manufacturing, retail, trade, transportation and utilities.

Mark Milley said Friday calls to his Communist Chinese counterpart in the last days of Donald Trump’s presidency were “routine” and fell “perfectly within the duties and responsibilities” of his job as the top U.S. military officer. In his first public acknowledgement of the exchanges, Milley observed such telephone calls were done “to reassure both allies and adversaries in this case in order to ensure strategic stability.” The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff spoke to The Associated Press (AP) and another reporter traveling with him to Europe to state his...

A new D.C. law makes it easier for them to seek early release.When attorney Andrew Flood took on a new client this summer, the Virginia prison where the D.C. man was serving a decades-long sentence listed fewer than five coronavirus cases. The numbers quickly shot up. Forty-three in September. Seventy-two in October. Flood watched the numbers rise as he pressed for Willie Neal’s early release after serving nearly 30 years for two armed robberies. As an overweight Black man with hypertension and asthma, Neal ran a high risk of life-threatening complications from the coronavirus.

His father, the garrulous mayor of that decaying factory town, taught him how to cobble together an electoral coalition, passing down the tricks of the trade that became the basis for the son’s lucrative career as a political consultant.

To hear the local papers tell the story—or to read the counts alleged in a prosecutor’s indictment—Paul’s father, the local political boss, served as a protector of...
__label__4 Our Defeat In Afghanistan Is Only The BeginningANALYSISAs the post-9/11 chapter closes, a new one begins, marked above all by the end of American deterrence and the eclipse of American power. Our total defeat and ignominious, disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan, after 20 years of war and nation-building, closes a chapter on post-9/11 America — and opens another. What comes next is to some extent uncertain, but you don’t need to be a grand strategist to see the broad outlines of what is already taking shape. First and most obvious, Afghanistan will revert to being a terrorist haven....

__label__4 Bait-And-Switch: How Officials Perpetuate Bad Foreign PolicyOPINIONUnscrupulous used car dealers could learn a trick or two from America’s foreign policy mandarins when it comes to bait-and-switch tactics. Repeatedly, U.S. officials have invoked a specific justification—frequently an emotionally charged one with wide appeal—to obtain congressional and public support for a military intervention or other questionable policy initiative. When the original justification subsequently proves to be bogus, exaggerated, or no longer applicable, they simply create a new rationale to justify continuing the mission. That tactic is especially evident with respect to the seemingly endless war in Afghanistan. U.S....
__label__3 Changed by pandemic, many workers won’t return to old jobsThere’s a wild card in the push to return to pre-pandemic life: Many workers don’t want to go back to the jobs they once had. Layoffs and lockdowns, combined with enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, gave many Americans the time and the financial cushion to rethink their careers. Their former employers are hiring again — and some, like Uber and McDonald’s, are offering higher pay — but workers remain hesitant. In March, U.S. job openings rose 8% to a record 8.1 million, but overall hiring rose less than 4%,...

Have you been to your local grocery store? Minimum wage workers who have kept food on our tables have been called "frontline heroes" – and yet when the chance arose to increase their wage to $15 an hour, the proposal was voted down. And the vote was not just along party lines – eight Democrats joined Republicans in rebuffing the bill. These votes are influenced by the massive power that special interests have over...

__label__2 Something appears to be ‘simply, simply wrong’ at the Biden Justice DepartmentOPINIONDuring the final days of the Trump administration, the attorney general used extraordinary measures to obtain subpoenas to secretly seize records of reporters at three leading U.S. news organizations. After this was reported last month, President Biden rightly decried this attack on the First Amendment, calling it “simply, simply wrong” and assuring Americans that it would not happen in his administration. Unfortunately, new revelations suggest that the Biden Justice Department not only allowed these disturbing intrusions to continue — it intensified the government‘s attack on First Amendment rights before finally backing down in the face of...

__label__3 Cannabis Prohibition’s Last StandANALYSISIt’s no secret: most Americans believe cannabis should be legal. Today, 17 states have legalized adult-use, meaning more than 40% of Americans now live in a state where marijuana is allowed for those over 21. More than 30 states allow some kind of medical marijuana access, which leaves only two that have not amended their marijuana laws at all—Idaho and Nebraska. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised that he and Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden will introduce their cannabis legalization bill, but he hasn’t issued a timeline. Despite the overwhelming support from Americans to legalize...
__label__1 DoJ reclaims millions paid to hackers after attack that hobbled US pipelineThe US Justice Department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyberattack that caused the operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said Monday. The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware taskforce created by the Biden administration, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world.

Illinois received $72 million in revenue from liquor sales. The state has repeatedly broken its own monthly weed sales records, with both in- and out-of-state adult sales hitting $28 million in March...
__label__2 Why Is Merrick Garland’s DOJ Carrying Water for Bill Barr?OPINIONLast night, the Washington Post reported that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance empaneled a grand jury in his ongoing criminal investigation of the Trump Organization. It’s a huge step. There is now a real possibility that Trump, his family, or high-ranking officials in his organization will be indicted for financial crimes. But the DA’s work (and the work of New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose investigation into the Trump Organization has recently taken on a criminal focus) is mainly a clean-up job. They’re looking into Trump’s business crimes, and much of...

Fewer than one-in-ten (8%) say marijuana should not be legal for use by adults.The new survey, conducted by Pew Research Center from April 5-11, 2021, comes as congressional Democrats consider legislation that would decriminalize marijuana nationally. Views of marijuana legalization have changed very little since 2019.

"No, I don't," Harris replied. "I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished. But I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed...
__label__4 Bolton: Trump Only Bluffing on Stopping North KoreaPresident Donald Trump does not really mean it when he vows to stop North Korea from having deliverable nuclear weapons, former national security adviser John Bolton told Axios in an interview published on Sunday. "We're now nearly three years into the administration with no visible progress toward getting North Korea to make the strategic decision to stop pursuing deliverable nuclear weapons," said Bolton, who left the Trump administration in September. He added that "Time is on the side of the proliferator. The more time there is, the more time there...
__label__3 Schumer says Senate will move ahead on marijuana legalizationSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has vowed to move forward with legislation to federally legalize marijuana, even if President Biden resists such a move.  In an interview with Politico published Saturday, Schumer said he “will have an ongoing conversation” with Biden on the legalization of cannabis to “tell him how my views have evolved” on the issue.  However, Schumer said that if Biden, who has vocalized opposition to the full legalization of cannabis, does not eventually come around to the legislation, the Senate will still “move forward.”

__label__4 How To Turn The Reviving North Korea Crisis Into A Triumph For Both NationsANALYSISHere is a statement I never thought I would make: I feel bad for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The reason is obvious. Kim is a shrewd geopolitical player who has made many bold and tactically smart choices over the last few years. Cursed by geography that places a powerful China, South Korea, and Japan all at his doorstep with mighty U.S. forces in the region, Kim has set out to do what his grandfather and father did for decades: survive in a neighborhood filled with nations that would love...

__label__5 Trump’s Foreign Policy: The Popping Point of Maximum PressureOPINIONWe’re gaining momentum in our standoffs with China, Iran, and North Korea. So expect dangerous provocations. Donald Trump promised to shake up U.S. foreign policy. He has certainly done that from the Middle East to Asia. The U.S. is currently engaged in a three-front, maximum-pressure standoff with China, Iran, and North Korea — involving everything from tariffs to possible military action and the strictest sanctions in memory. At first, Trump critics saw these policy recalibrations as either impotent or counterproductive. Pessimists asserted that China, with a population four times the...
__label__3 Legalization Advocates Hope to End Mexico’s Drug WarA determined political movement to end the war on drugs has taken shape across Europe and North America. Harm reduction advocates say lives can be saved and resources spared, if only the state would move away from punishing drug users. Perhaps, some predict, the state could even get into the business of regulating the production and sale of once-illegal substances. Just last month, voters in Oregon and politicians in Vancouver, British Columbia, approved plans to decriminalize all illicit drugs, paving the way for a health care approach. They’re following the...

__label__3 U.N. Commission Removes Cannabis From Its Most Strict Drug Control ListThe U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted to reclassify cannabis Wednesday, taking it off the strict Schedule IV list that includes dangerous and highly addictive drugs such as heroin. The U.N. still deems cannabis a controlled substance. But the move, which the U.S. supported, could ease restrictions on research into marijuana's therapeutic use.The 53-member commission approved the change in a close vote, by 27-25, with 1 abstention. Russia was a vocal opponent of the move, calling cannabis "the most abused drug globally."
__label__2 What Kamala Harris’ Law School Years Reveal About Her PoliticsANALYSISThe signs in downtown San Francisco that day, outside of the University of California Hastings College of the Law, might as well have been plucked from today’s racial justice protests. “Rise Above Racism,” “Should This Still Be Happening?” and “What Is Next?” they read. It was February 15, 1989, and the campus had been pulsing with tension for a week, after students discovered that a bulletin board decorated by the Black Law Students Association (BLSA) to commemorate Black History Month had been vandalized with a racist marking: a grotesque caricature...
__label__4 Where to Now for the Trump Administration’s North Korea Policy?President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un have now met three times. With a fair amount of fanfare and hope, Trump had held two summits with Kim. The first was in June 2018. The second, in February 2019. Those summits produced modest consequences. One of them was that, amid an exchange of friendly letters between the two leaders, North Korea refrained from provocative military actions while the United States scaled back joint military actions with South Korea. Then, over the weekend, with dramatic suddenness and circumstance, the two...

Initiatives or propositions in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota would legalize marijuana for recreational use. Measures in Mississippi and South Dakota would legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. Proponents of those measures...

__label__3 Science Reveals The Cannabis Industry’s Greatest Lie: You’re Buying Weed Wrong (And So Is Everyone Else)ANALYSISThere’s much more to cannabis than THC—for solid proof, look no further than the CBD boom—but when it comes to moving product on the legal recreational market, only two numbers matter: the list price, and the THC content. Super-potent cannabis flower, with THC percentages of 25 percent and up, dominate dispensary shelves. High-THC cannabis will sell out very quickly while lower-percentage weed gathers dust. When cannabis tests at more than 25 percent THC, dispensaries can justify charging $75 or more for a store-bought eighth—because there’s a very good chance people...

__label__2 Up in Smoke? Vote to Legalize Pot Becomes Hazy Amid Stalled Stimulus, Democratic PushbackDemocrats really want to legalize marijuana at the federal level—a landmark vote that would be historic. Years ago, such a move would have been virtually unthinkable, given public attitudes toward the drug. But there is mounting pushback to nix next week's planned vote in the House to give cannabis high praise among rank-and-file members, particularly those in swing districts. The dissent could threaten Democratic leadership's plans to vote on what's dubbed the MORE Act (Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement). Vulnerable Democrats fear the optics of passing a weed bill amid...

__label__5 Bernie Sanders actually agrees with Trump’s North Korea strategyThe politics of North Korea made strange bedfellows of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on Saturday — when the Vermont Democrat said he doesn’t “fault” the president for his handling of Kim Jong Un.

__label__3 Are pot and guns essential in a pandemic?What’s happening: In the dictionary, the word essential has a simple definition. Merriam-Webster defines essential as an adjective meaning “of the utmost importance.” The coronavirus outbreak is proving that, in practice, deciding what’s essential is much more complicated. States and cities across America have mandated that all nonessential businesses close to help stem the spread of the virus. The bulk of the exceptions to these restrictions are clearly of “utmost importance”: hospitals, pharmacies, grocery stores, etc. The lists vary from place to place, with some surprising businesses being allowed to...

For Democrats who see Donald Trump as an unprecedented threat because of his disregard for the Constitution, the decision is a useful reminder that sacrificing civil liberties on the altar of national security is a bipartisan rite.

__label__3 The media’s epic failANALYSISA reckoning is hitting news organizations for years-old coverage of the 2017 Steele dossier, after the document's primary source was charged with lying to the FBI. Why it matters: It's one of the most egregious journalistic errors in modern history, and the media's response to its own mistakes has so far been tepid. Outsized coverage of the unvetted document drove a media frenzy at the start of Donald Trump's presidency that helped drive a narrative of collusion between former President Trump and Russia.  It also helped drive an even bigger wedge between former...
__label__1 Nikki Haley accused of hypocrisy for posting beachside pic after Memorial Day attack on Kamala HarrisANALYSISAnother day, another meaningless social media conflict in Washington DC totally divorced from the issues facing the country. Here’s how this one goes.On Saturday, vice-president Kamala Harris tweeted two things ahead of the Memorial Day holiday: a video of a conversation with Sydney Barber, the first Black woman Brigade Commander at the US Naval Academy, and a photo of herself along with the text, “Enjoy the long weekend.”
__label__5 Meet Tom Drake, the NSA Whistleblower Cheney Wanted to ‘Fry’“Find and fry the leaker or leakers. Burn them. We have to make an example of them.” Vice President Dick Cheney issued that edict after whistleblower Thomas Drake, a former senior executive at the NSA, revealed the unconstitutional mass surveillance regime that had been instituted after 9/11, Drake himself said in a recent interview with The American Conservative. The constant drumbeat of demands to reveal the names of whistleblowers who filed a complaint against President Trump gives Drake horrible “flashbacks,” he says. And while Republicans endlessly repeat that the American...
__label__3 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...
__label__1 The Inside Story of the Biden-Harris Debate BlowupANALYSISPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have appeared so in lockstep that it’s hard to remember how tense their early campaign days were. As president, Joe Biden has made sure to elevate Vice President Kamala Harris, including her in nearly every aspect of his presidency and making her the point person on migration, a top issue. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff have hit it off. At least so far, there’s been little of the drama or staff fighting that have marked many relationships between...

OAN founder and chief executive Robert Herring Sr has testified that the inspiration to launch OAN in 2013 came from AT&T executives. “They...
__label__1 No, Workers Aren’t Striking Because of Vaccine MandatesOPINIONThere’s a meme traveling around conservative media that vaccine mandates are the cause of the ongoing strike wave. Although you certainly can find news stories here and there about someone quitting due to a vaccine mandate or a small-scale labor protest (such as a slowdown or sickout) due to the vaccine mandate, it is clearly not the case that opposition to the vaccine mandate is driving the much bigger labor market developments. The real driver is labor market tightness. Quits Quit rates and levels tend to move in lockstep with...

And as the U.S inches closer to war with North Korea, the White House body charged with discussing and coordinating U.S. foreign policy is engulfed in what one administration official called a “poisonous environment.”
__label__3 What does ‘off the record’ mean? The latest journalism controversyOPINION“Off the record.” It’s a well-known journalism phrase. So well known, in fact, that even those outside the business are familiar with it. But what does it actually mean? The common belief among many is that when a source tells a reporter something “off the record” that means the reporter cannot or should not publicly share that information. But that’s not exactly how it works. Just because a source says something is “off the record” does not mean it truly is “off the record.” Here’s how it should work. A...

The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...

A hundred years after the United States adopted daylight savings time — a contrivance developed to extract maximum labor power from workers — we might indulge in some musings on how a different society would make time for workers. Our world prioritizes profit above all else, and, unless we are wealthy enough...

Rather than grants, the trust makes investments. Advice and some control come with the help. But the point is for recipients to gather other investors and develop models for serving small-town news deserts that are losing all local coverage. I refer to the project as Hansen Shapiro’s because she developed the idea, first as a Ph.D. thesis, then as a research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, and now as a...

For every million dollars the United States government invests, solar produces over 2.7 times more jobs than fossil fuels, according to an analysis from two environmental think tanks and a labor union. Wind energy spurs over 2.8 times more jobs than investments in oil, gas and coal. And retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient creates demand for...

Why it matters: The party's trust in media starting dropping when President Trump took office, but has plummeted much more dramatically in the Biden era. Details: Prior to the Trump administration, both parties had a great deal of trust in the national media, according to Pew. But while Democrats' trust in the national, local and social media continues to hold steady, Republicans' trust...

__label__2 Biden’s Authority to Mandate Vaccines Stems From Law Protecting Workers From ‘Grave Dangers’President Biden’s far-reaching assertion of presidential authority to require vaccines for 80 million American workers relies on a first-of-its-kind application of a 51-year-old law that grants the federal government the power to protect employees from “grave dangers” at the workplace. White House officials believe the emergency authority provided by Congress under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is a legitimate and legal way to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But they acknowledge that the law’s emergency provisions, which were employed in previous decades to protect workers from asbestos and...

Jim Sensenbrenner, the main author of the original Patriot Act, wrote an op-ed in 2013 explaining the NSA bulk collection of data belonging to Americans is an abuse of the legislation. In particular, Sensenbrenner slammed the Obama administration for abusing the Patriot Act in order to collect phone call information of all Americans, despite any ties to terrorism.  Last week, the Guardian reported that the Obama administration is collecting records of every call made to, from or within the US, as well as records of many digital communications....

__label__3 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...

During a White House press briefing on Monday, Psaki was asked, “As he sat down with Prime Minister Modi last week, the president said that the Indian press is better behaved than the U.S. press and then he advised him not to take questions. Can you explain why the American president was criticizing U.S. reporters in that setting?” “Well, I would note first...
__label__1 America's Only LGBTQ Historic District Is Falling ApartANALYSISOne of North America’s first openly lesbian poets launched her career by pissing off H.P. Lovecraft. In 1918, at the age of 19, Elsa Gidlow started publishing North America’s first known LGBTQ-themed magazine out of her home in Montreal. Combining queer poetry, one-act plays about young gay love, and progressive social commentary, Les mouches fantastiques quickly gained a cult following far beyond the city and even Canada—culminating in a back-and-forth literary journal spat with the noted horror writer (and racist), who decried the magazine’s promotion of an “ancient selfish hedonism.” In 1920, Gidlow moved...

__label__3 What does ‘off the record’ mean? The latest journalism controversyOPINION“Off the record.” It’s a well-known journalism phrase. So well known, in fact, that even those outside the business are familiar with it. But what does it actually mean? The common belief among many is that when a source tells a reporter something “off the record” that means the reporter cannot or should not publicly share that information. But that’s not exactly how it works. Just because a source says something is “off the record” does not mean it truly is “off the record.” Here’s how it should work. A...
__label__2 More Americans understand LGBTQ people, but visibility has 'double-edged sword', GLAAD report saysMore and more people are identifying as members of the LGBTQ community. Increased visibility educates non-LGBTQ people, but it also comes with a purported price, according to GLAAD's annual Accelerating Acceptance Study out Wednesday. The report found that 43% of non-LGBTQ people think gender is not exclusively male and female, up from 38% in 2020. And 81% of non-LGBTQ people anticipate nonbinary and transgender people will become as familiar in everyday life as gay and lesbian people have. "Our community continues to grow, and we're seeing some growing acceptance of that," says Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD CEO. "We...
__label__5 Iran Reportedly Turns Down Nuclear Negotiations With US, Escalating TensionsIran turned down an offer to engage in direct talks regarding the nation’s nuclear capabilities with U.S. and European diplomats, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iranian government officials declined an invitation from European Union officials to attend the nuclear talks, which the U.S. had agreed to attend, two senior diplomats familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Iran reportedly wanted a guarantee that the U.S. would lift some sanctions following the in-person negotiations, which were set to take place this week.
__label__3 Afghan journalists’ battle: To keep free expression aliveThe message of the vengeful Taliban fighters was clear when they raided the offices of state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) in Logar province, as the region south of Kabul fell to the jihadist juggernaut in mid-August. An Afghan journalist describes being severely beaten as the Taliban destroyed his computer with an assault rifle, then trashed the television and radio studio. “Shut up and don’t raise your voice!” a fighter warned the journalist. “If you raise your voice, we will kill you.” For days afterward, he had nightmares that the Taliban...

The race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor of the state, and Republican Glenn Youngkin has been closer than expected, with a bitter cultural battle taking center stage in the campaign. While much of the attention has gone to the nationalized moral panic over critical race theory, which explores America’s history of slavery and racial inequality and which conservatives have defined as teaching any...

__label__3 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__2 Opinion on the use of puberty blockers in America is turningWorries about the use of puberty blockers, which are prescribed to some children to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (like breasts and facial hair) have been mounting in much of the rich world. Some countries have scaled back their use. Not America. Doctors who work in transgender clinics routinely claim that prescribing such drugs is conservative, because their effects are largely reversible, and compassionate, because they save children with gender dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body) from enormous distress. That may be beginning to change. Last...

__label__3 The National Trust for Local News is trying to build a $300 million fund to help save local newsIn the crowded field of nonprofits supporting local news ventures, Elizabeth Hansen Shapiro’s National Trust for Local News stands out as something distinct. Rather than grants, the trust makes investments. Advice and some control come with the help. But the point is for recipients to gather other investors and develop models for serving small-town news deserts that are losing all local coverage. I refer to the project as Hansen Shapiro’s because she developed the idea, first as a Ph.D. thesis, then as a research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, and now as a...
__label__1 The Culture War Over ‘Pregnant People’ANALYSISLast year, a brand-new labor-and-delivery hospital opened on the well-to-do Upper East Side of New York City. Its name, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns, might strike most people as innocuous or straightforward. But to some people, the suggestion that a hospital where babies are born is for women is offensive, because transgender and nonbinary people who do not identify as women can also get pregnant and deliver babies. Only niche groups tend to care about how Americans discuss gender and pregnancy—including whether it’s better to use the...

Local news isn’t really helping.Parents around the country are freaking out and holding their collective breath as a new school year begins. My kid has been back at in-person school for about a month, and we’ve been averaging about two robocalls a week about new cases of Covid at school. What’s worse, the school district’s Covid plans, 20 months into the pandemic, seem to be another fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants affair. Our school didn’t post its Covid protocols on its website until three weeks after classes started. Quarantine criteria are opaque, and what you do catch in tidbits from...

(The slides were based in part on data about a COVID outbreak linked to Provincetown, Massachusetts; on Friday, the CDC published that data.) Although “breakthrough” infections in...
__label__2 Education Department says Title IX protections apply to LGBTQ studentsThe Education Department on Wednesday issued guidance that Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, a reversal of the Trump administration's stance that gay and transgender students are not protected by the law.

__label__5 High stakes: National security community braces for nuclear brinkmanship if summit failsAll signs may point to a successful and historic summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, but the stakes are so high that the U.S. national security community is braced for the possibility of a rapid spiral toward nuclear brinkmanship if the talks between the two men turn sour. With the North Korean side notorious for bizarre antics and sudden walkouts from diplomatic meetings, it remains anyone’s guess how Tuesday’s face-to-face will ultimately play out — even as most analysts agree that Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim are both driven...

Now U.S. news outlets are rethinking itANALYSISWhen suspects’ names appear in crime stories, their lives may be broken and never put back together. For years, people have begged the Associated Press to scrub their indiscretions from its archives. Some of those requests “were heart-rending,” said John Daniszewski, standards VP at AP who helped to spearhead the worldwide news service’s new policy, announced in June. Acknowledging that journalism can inflict wounds unnecessarily, AP will no longer name those arrested for minor crimes when the news service is unlikely to cover the story’s subsequent developments. Often, such stories’ publication...

Instead, the migrants are being turned away by two Biden enforced immigration policies that originated under previous administrations. The first is the "Remain in Mexico" policy that requires migrants to stay in Mexico until their U.S. immigration court date. This policy enables migrants to make a claim to asylum in the United States, but requires them to await the determination of the...

GREG ABBOTT: I don’t know if Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration either don’t have a clue what’s going on or they are purposefully misleading their fellow Americans because here are the numbers. On the national level with regard to the Border Patrol, they apprehended last month—in the...
__label__3 Fear Shakes A Mexico Border City After Violence Leaves 18 DeadFear has invaded the Mexican border city of Reynosa after gunmen in vehicles killed 14 people, including taxis drivers, workers and a nursing student, and security forces responded with operations that left four suspects dead.While this city across the border from McAllen, Texas is used to cartel violence as a key trafficking point, the 14 victims in Saturday's attacks appeared to be what Tamaulipas Gov. Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca called "innocent citizens" rather than members of one gang killed by a rival.
__label__2 Schumer Will Propose Federal Decriminalization of MarijuanaSenator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, will offer draft legislation to remove marijuana from the list of controlled substances and begin regulating and taxing it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York plans to propose legislation on Wednesday to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, putting his weight as majority leader behind a growing movement to unwind the decades-old war on drugs. The draft bill, called the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and begin regulating and taxing it, placing federal rules on a burgeoning...
__label__5 Biden Restores a Barrier to Opioid Addiction TreatmentAnonymous sources close to the White House say the Biden administration plans to reinstate special licensing requirements for physicians to prescribe buprenorphine, the most common medication used to treat opioid use disorder. Shortly before President Donald Trump left office, his administration updated federal guidelines to discontinue the "X-waiver," a regulation that required physicians to obtain eight hours of additional training before prescribing buprenorphine for addiction treatment. Although the Biden administration has made no official decision, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently removed the relaxed guidelines from its...
__label__3 Why Has AMLO Accused USAID of a “Coup Against Mexico”?ANALYSIS“It’s not like USAID is going to invade somebody,” the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Obama-era chief Gayle Smith told the New York Times in April. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is apparently not so sure. U.S. organizations like USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Ford Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation have long had funding agreements with civil society organizations in Mexico—a feature of bilateral relations for some 60 years. Major civil society efforts in Mexico promoting press freedom, access to justice, government transparency, corporate responsibility, and freedom from...
__label__1 The Olympics are stuck in the 1980s on marijuanaWhat would have happened if Sha’Carri Richardson were suspended from the Olympics for marijuana use in the 1980s? In the era of Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” mantra, as the country barreled further into its war on drugs, much of the public likely would have backed the move to block the sprinter from competing after a failed drug test. Politicians on the right and left, many of whom worked together to enact punitive anti-drug laws, would have said the suspension sends the right message to the public about the dangers...
__label__5 Pelosi’s San Francisco: 70% Increase in Drug Overdoses Last Year, More than a Death a DayThe Department of Public Health released a report on Monday that showed deaths from drug overdoses increased 70 percent last year in San Francisco, a staggering statistic that represents more than one death a day in that city. The report said 441 people died of an overdose in 2019 compared to 259 in 2018. And more than half — 54 precent — were related to fentanyl, a drug that can be 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the federal government. “This doesn’t surprise any of us,” Kristen...
__label__3 What to watch in AMLO's meeting with HarrisJoint efforts to stem the increased number of migrants heading to the U.S. will likely be at the top of discussions when Vice President Kamala Harris and Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador hold their virtual meeting on Friday. The big picture: The U.S. government has consistently asked its southern neighbor to prevent immigrants from reaching the border, mostly through threats like former President Trump’s talk of tariffs. But the Biden administration is signaling a willingness to collaborate on the many other issues important to both countries (but that are...
__label__2 Did Michael Phelps Test Positive for Marijuana and Still Compete in Olympics?FACT CHECKIn July 2021, American track and field star Sha’Carri Richardson was suspended for one month and disqualified from the 2021 Olympic Games after she tested positive for THC, a psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. While many social media users criticized the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for even testing for a drug that is now legal in many states and is being used as medication with increased frequency, others drew a comparison between Richardson and another Olympic athlete, Michael Phelps, who was supposedly allowed to compete despite also testing positive for marijuana. But Phelps did not...
__label__4 The San Francisco Mess Proves Decriminalizing Drugs Doesn’t WorkANALYSISPresident Donald Trump has expressed willingness to interfere in the West Coast’s seemingly intractable “homelessness” problem: “Donald Trump said he might ‘intercede’ to ‘clean up’ homelessness in San Francisco and Los Angeles, noting that world leaders ‘can’t be looking at that.’” “That,” our noxious streets, certainly are a shame, only some of us have forgotten how to feel shame — or compassion. The “homelessness”crisis, which is really the opioid crisis dressed up in class warfare language, is manufactured. It was created, to a large extent, by the local judiciary, but...

__label__1 Rising U.S. Track Star Sha’Carri Richardson Tests Positive for Marijuana, Could Miss Tokyo OlympicsAmerican sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who was set to be a breakout star at the Olympic Games later this month, has tested positive for marijuana, putting her participation in the Tokyo games in doubt. The 21-year-old, sporting bright orange hair and an electric personality, roared to victory in the women’s 100-meter sprint at the U.S. Olympic trials, making her a fan favorite as well as a favorite to win gold. The positive test taken at the trials last month means Richardson will likely face a competition ban of some length; the sanction for...
__label__5 Surgeon General Rejects Supervised Injection Sites: ‘Safer Doesn’t Mean Safe’Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Wednesday rejected the provision of supervised injection sites, facilities where people can inject themselves with illegal drugs under medical supervision, as a response to the opioid crisis, citing safety concerns. “I’m not bashing any particular person or group,” Adams said at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., “But the truth is, I have looked at the data, and I have seen little to no data suggesting they are overall more effective than expanding syringe services programs.” “Safer doesn’t mean safe,” the surgeon general added...
__label__3 U.S.-Mexico Efforts Targeting Drug Cartels Have Unraveled, Top DEA Official SaysA senior Drug Enforcement Administration official told NPR efforts to target drug cartels operating inside Mexico have unraveled because of a breakdown in cooperation between law enforcement agencies and militaries in the two countries. "We're willing to share [intelligence] with our counterparts in Mexico, but they themselves are too afraid to even engage with us because of repercussions from their own government if they get caught working with DEA," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's deputy chief of operations. The collapse of joint drug interdiction efforts has occurred at a time...

They were joined by the Utah Medical Association and law enforcement groups to announce a deal to legalize medical marijuana across the state. Everyone was there in large part because the church had decided they would be. “You could just almost hear the teeth grinding of the law enforcement — and some of...

__label__3 Biden’s southern border czar Roberta Jacobson to step down at the end of AprilSouthern border coordinator Roberta Jacobson’s last day in the Biden White House will be at the end of April before she retires, she announced on Friday. Why it matters: The former ambassador to Mexico has been at the forefront of the administration’s efforts to handle the surge of migrants at the border — which shows no sign of stopping. Jacobson’s departure comes after there were more illegal border crossings in March than in any single month in 15 years on top of record numbers of unaccompanied minors overwhelming government immigration...
__label__2 Biden’s blunt opposition to marijuana legalizationANALYSISAs his own party moves ahead on the issue, the president remains opposed to legalization. This month, something unusual happened: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took a stand against President Joe Biden. The New York Democrat, typically a strong Biden ally, has transformed into one of the Senate’s biggest advocates for marijuana legalization, which Biden continues to oppose. But Schumer said he’ll move forward with his legalization bill anyway. “I want to make my arguments to him, as many other advocates will,” Schumer said. “But at some point we’re going...
__label__5 A Bipartisan Way to Make Prescription Drugs AffordableOPINIONAmericans are concerned about the high price of drugs. The pharmaceutical industry has become a system rife with gaming. Profits are regularly prioritized over patients. Laws meant to encourage innovation, recoup private investment, and ensure patient access are too often manipulated to suppress competition and increase prices. These unscrupulous industry practices can take many forms, but the result is always the same: Drug prices increase in a captive market. Gimmicks and price increases are costly to patients and taxpayers. No conservative should defend the status quo.

These are the stories of four migrants who live in the camp. For their safety and protection, we did not photograph them, and we have given them pseudonyms. We asked each of them, "What does the American Dream mean to you?"
__label__1 Where weed is legalState legislatures have been slow to catch up to the marijuana legalization trend as, time and again, they let voters decide what to do about decades-old weed laws. That’s changing this year. Virginia’s Legislature passed a recreational legalization bill in February, becoming the first Southern state to fully embrace weed. Last week, lawmakers in New York and New Mexico legalized weed for adults, after years of failed efforts. New Jersey lawmakers also passed legislation implementing a voter-approved legalization amendment. And more conservative states like Kansas and Alabama are moving medical...

The legislation “embraces an industry that will grow the Empire State's economy, and prioritizes marginalized communities so those that have suffered the most will be the first to reap the benefits," Cuomo said in a statement. Eventually the legal cannabis program could generate up to $3.5 billion a year in...

__label__3 Mexico’s President Is Spoiling for a Fight With WashingtonANALYSISU.S. President Joe Biden has vowed a return to diplomatic normalcy instead of personal lunacy, multilateralism instead of unilateralism, and a foreign policy conducted through institutionalized channels instead of through Twitter. Most foreign governments have greeted the change with relief—but the applause has not been unanimous. Some countries benefited from the lack of engagement or scrutiny they got under former President Donald Trump. Mexico, in particular, looks set to receive Biden’s agenda not with open arms but with a raised fist.
__label__2 New York just legalized marijuanaNew York on Wednesday legalized marijuana, with the legislature passing a bill and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signing it into law. Under the law, people 21 and older will be able to grow and use marijuana. The state will also set up a regulated, legal marijuana market, with new tax revenues directed to education, drug treatment and prevention, and communities disproportionately hurt by the war on drugs. And it will automatically expunge people’s criminal records of marijuana offenses that are no longer illegal. The law came together after years of back-and-forth...

At a Wednesday press briefing, a reporter pressed Psaki on the Biden administration terminating five employees over previous marijuana consumption, even though staff were “led to believe pot use would not be disqualifying.”  Psaki insisted that the administration had worked with the security service, “which makes this determination” and that “in the past, the rules were...

__label__3 Legalization Advocates Hope to End Mexico’s Drug WarA determined political movement to end the war on drugs has taken shape across Europe and North America. Harm reduction advocates say lives can be saved and resources spared, if only the state would move away from punishing drug users. Perhaps, some predict, the state could even get into the business of regulating the production and sale of once-illegal substances. Just last month, voters in Oregon and politicians in Vancouver, British Columbia, approved plans to decriminalize all illicit drugs, paving the way for a health care approach. They’re following the...

__label__5 Trump Signs Order Interpreting Judaism As A Nationality And RaceANALYSISUPDATE: With his son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner hovering inches behind him, President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that interprets Judaism as a nationality or race and religion so that the federal government can threaten to withhold funds from schools deemed to be fostering anti-semitism in school activities, programs, curricula and classrooms. What it really will do is put a chill on speech, as skittish administrations shut down protests, screen speakers, and monitor classrooms for unsanctioned criticisms against Israel. “It is a game changer,” said Trump legal advisor...

Here’s how they’re fighting back.A vanilla-infused breeze causes fragile palms to sway and wave along the streets of Papantla, a municipality in northern Veracruz, Mexico. Other than the occasional passerby photographing mural-covered buildings or the buzz of a motorcyclist emitting puffs of exhaust, this quiet town in the country’s eastern region is relatively at peace. But on March 30, those peaceful streets turned red with blood when reporter María Elena Ferral Hernández was gunned down in broad daylight.

The treaty, which concerns the activities of the Catholic Church in Palestinian territory, makes clear that the Holy See has switched its diplomatic recognition from the Palestine Liberation Organization to the state of Palestine.

Like many Californians, he vapes marijuana concentrate for a variety of health problems such as anxiety. But even though he lives within a half-hour drive of a legal dispensary, Alex purchases his cannabis on what he likes to call the “duty-free” market. About once a month, he drives an hour to an acquaintance’s house to purchase about an ounce of concentrate, for about half of what he would pay at a state-certified recreational dispensary. There’s a reason Alex buys on the black...
__label__5 Biden's 'Rescue Plan' Will Sic the IRS on Anyone Who Earns $600 in the Gig EconomyANALYSISUber drivers, Etsy sellers, and others who earn income through the gig economy could get a nasty surprise from the $1.9 trillion emergency spending bill signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday. Buried inside the 600-page bill that's ostensibly meant to provide pandemic relief is a provision requiring gig economy platforms to report information to the IRS about all users who earn at least $600 in a year. Previously, platforms were only required to provide the IRS with information on users who made at least 200 transactions or earned at...
__label__3 The Taliban’s Sharia Is the Most Brutal of AllOPINIONLate last month, the Taliban killed four men and hung their dead bodies in public squares in the northwestern Afghan city of Herat. One lifeless corpse dangled off a crane above throngs of commuters who were stunned at the exhibition and grasping the significance of the moment—a return to the past. The group’s newly appointed mayor declared the killed as kidnappers and boasted about the display of the dead as an effective deterrent. He warned: Other criminals would meet the same fate. Due process was an additional casualty of the...
__label__1 The Bizarre Case of a Death Allegedly Caused by CBD OilTwo days after trying a new CBD oil extract to treat her chronic pain, a 56-year-old woman developed an awful rash. Her primary care physician prescribed antihistamines and prednisone, a common steroid used to treat inflammation. She went home. The rash got worse. From a local emergency room, she went to a hospital burn unit. There, the rash went out of control. Angry red lesions broke out over 30 percent of her body, including her eyes and groin. Skin peeled from her arms and back. Doctors administered more antibiotics, more...
__label__5 Biden-Trudeau ‘Roadmap’ Commits to Fight ‘Systemic Racism,’ Climate Change; Excludes Keystone XLU.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a “Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership” on Tuesday that commits to fight “systemic racism” and COVID-19, but ignores the Keystone XL pipeline. In a preamble, the two leaders declare: “The Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership announced today establishes a blueprint for an ambitious and whole-of-government effort against the COVID-19 pandemic and in support of our mutual prosperity. It creates a partnership on climate change, advances global health security, bolsters cooperation on defense and security, and it reaffirms...
__label__3 The family of the 10 Afghans the Pentagon accidentally killed in a drone strike say the US hasn't offered them any compensationThe family of 10 Afghans killed in error by a US drone strike last month said the US hasn't offered them any compensation, CNN reported. Ten people, including seven children, died after a US drone hit a compound near Kabul on August 29. The Pentagon thought it had found an ISIS-K militant preparing a terror attack, but it had actually struck Zemari Ahmadi, an aid worker, and his family. Ahmadi had been observed loading boxes into his car, which the US military believed were full of explosives. Footage obtained by The New York Times showed that...
__label__2 Feds Tell Ex-NFL Star to Stop Saying His Weed Can Cure CoronavirusThe federal government is warning a former National Football League player's company to stop advertising his medicinal cannabis products as treatments for the novel coronavirus. The Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to that effect on Tuesday to the Las Vegas headquarters of Neuro XPF, which is owned by former NFL offensive tackle Kyle Turley. Turley insists that CBD, a popular non-psychoactive cannabis derivative, can cure the coronavirus. In fact, Neuro XPF had an entire page of its website, headlined “CRUSH CORONA,” devoted...
__label__5 Poll: Majority Of Trump Voters Believe In Climate Change But Question The Left’s Extreme SolutionsPolling data suggests voters who backed former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election hold more nuanced opinions on climate change than the binary climate denial versus climate acceptance debate as framed by progressive climate activists.
__label__3 About 100 Americans are still trying to get out of AfghanistanAbout 100 US citizens and permanent residents are still waiting to leave Afghanistan, an anonymous senior State Department official told reporters on Monday, according to Reuters. "Our highest priority in Afghanistan, of course, remains helping those American citizens who wish to leave the country now to do so," the official said. The war in Afghanistan effectively ended on August 30 as the remaining US troops left the country, making it more difficult to evacuate Americans who want to come back home. But roughly 85 Americans and 79 legal permanent residents have left...
__label__2 People Are Still Using Cannabis During The Pandemic. How Are They Getting It?What better way to deal with a global, economy-shattering, life-altering, seemingly endless pandemic than tucking in at home (as the government has asked you to do for a few weeks now), watching something soothing (may I recommend Tiger King?), and rolling a joint, using some CBD drops, eating an edible, or whatever else is your preferred method of cannabis relaxation? But, of course, it’s not clear how much access to cannabis we’ll have as the shutdown goes on. In response to a BuzzFeed News callout, hundreds of people across the...
__label__4 Bill Gates’s Climate HysteriaOPINIONThis past Sunday, Bill Gates (net worth, $133 billion) and Anderson Cooper ($110 million) got together on 60 Minutes to discuss the numerous sacrifices Americans will be expected to make to avert an imminent climate catastrophe.First, we should refrain from referring to these sorts of conversations as “journalism,” since Cooper never challenges any of Gates’s wild predictions nor displays even a hint of professional skepticism regarding the subject matter. Cooper simply cues up the next talking point like a host of an in-house corporate video.
__label__2 Taliban official: Strict punishment, executions will returnOne of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan said the hard-line movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers. “Everyone criticized us for the punishments in...
__label__2 What is CHS? Marijuana advocates warn of a little-known condition affecting heavy usersAs more and more U.S. states expand marijuana legalization, and with weed usage on the rise, doctors and advocates are warning about a little-known condition affecting heavy users of the drug. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS, causes severe abdominal pain, nausea and “cyclic vomiting” among regular marijuana users — and can lead to extreme dehydration and, in rare cases, death. “It’s very underdiagnosed,” said Dr. Joseph Habboushe, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at New York University Langone/Bellevue Medical Center, who co-authored a 2018 study on CHS. “Doctors aren’t thinking...
__label__5 Under Trump, Americans Breathed The Cleanest Air In U.S. History, And Other Environmental Wins The Biden Administration DeletedANALYSISDuring his first two days “unifying” the nation, President Joseph R. Biden delivered for the most radical environmental interests of the Democrat coalition that nominated and elected him. After all, that is what he promised to do. Killing the Keystone Pipeline and rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement is just the start of his “unifying” environmental agenda. Over the last month, the White House and federal agencies go through the same ritual of preparing accomplishment reports. And they should. My office prepared one. The secretary’s office prepared one. After all, we...
__label__2 Friction among Taliban pragmatists, hard-liners intensifiesFriction between pragmatists and ideologues in the Taliban leadership has intensified since the group formed a hard-line Cabinet last week that is more in line with their harsh rule in the 1990s than their recent promises of inclusiveness, said two Afghans familiar with the power struggle. The wrangling has taken place behind the scenes, but rumors quickly began circulating about a recent violent confrontation between the two camps at the presidential palace, including claims that the leader of the pragmatic faction, Abdul Ghani Baradar, was killed. The rumors reached such...
__label__2 'This was supposed to be reparations' Why is LA's cannabis industry devastating black entrepreneurs?A Los Angeles government program set up to provide cannabis licenses to people harmed by the war on drugs has been plagued by delays, scandal and bureaucratic blunders, costing some intended beneficiaries hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses. Black entrepreneurs and activists across LA told the Guardian that the city’s embattled “social equity” program has left aspiring business owners on an indefinite waiting list, causing potentially irreparable damage to their families’ finances and preventing them from opening marijuana shops they have been planning for years. Fewer than 20 of...
__label__5 Scrapping Keystone XL pipeline makes Biden a tribal hero, but villain off reservationOn a blustery winter day in South Dakota, the security guard stationed at the "man camp" outside the tiny town of Philip isn't in the mood for pleasantries. It takes him about 90 seconds to get into his white pickup truck and make his way over to the chain-link fence. He's in no mood to talk. He doesn't even break a smile. He points to the red and white "no trespassing" sign and makes a gesture to leave. His job is to make sure no one steps foot on the...
__label__3 What has 20 years of the ‘war on terror’ accomplished?On Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.” That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years....
__label__1 Investors rush to bring weed to the massesTODAY EUROPE’S first cannabis exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Medical Cannabis and Wellness ETF, dubbed CBSX, launches in Germany. A joint project of Purpose Investments, a Canadian asset manager, and HANetf, a British ETF platform, the fund will invest in listed businesses that grow, make and distribute medical cannabis products. One of the goals of the new venture is to democratise cannabis investments, which have historically been inaccessible (because companies are still private) or expensive (because investors must buy stocks individually). The rise of ETFs—pooled portfolios designed to replicate the performance...
__label__4 Chuck Schumer: Combating Climate Change Will Be a ‘Whole of Senate Approach’Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) plans to make combatting climate change a “whole of Senate approach” for however long Democrats retain the majority.Schumer, who leads a chamber split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, announced on Tuesday that he had instructed his party’s committee chairs to make the issue a top priority. The majority leader, in particular, argued that by mobilizing every “relevant” committee to tackle climate change, the Senate would take “a leading role in combatting the existential threat of our time.”
__label__3 Does the U.S. have any real leverage over the Taliban?Since retaking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have tried to assure the rest of the world that their new government will be different from the brutal, oppressive regime that ruled the country in the years before the American invasion. They have vowed to respect women’s rights to some degree, forgive those who had allied with the U.S. military and prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a staging ground for attacks. “We want the world to trust us,” a Taliban spokesperson said. Unsurprisingly, the notion of a kinder, gentler Taliban has been met with deep...
__label__2 The Straight Dope on CBDIn June 2018 the FDA approved the drug Epidiolex, the first pharmaceutical drug made from cannabidiol (CBD) and intended to treat two very severe forms of epilepsy. The announcement seemed to add to the growing prominence of CBD—although it remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. In many health food stores and head shops, you can find CBD in everything from body lotion and bath bombs to chocolate and pet treats. A friend recently reported that she spotted CBD-infused condoms while traveling in Amsterdam. CBD is certainly having...

__label__3 Taliban say they took Panjshir, last holdout Afghan provinceThe Taliban said on Monday they have taken control of Panjshir province north of Kabul, the last holdout of anti-Taliban forces in the country and the only province the Taliban had not seized during their blitz across Afghanistan last month. Thousands of Taliban fighters overran eight districts of Panjshir overnight, according to witnesses from the area who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement, saying Panjshir was now under control of Taliban fighters. “We tried our best to solve the problem...
__label__1 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...

__label__3 Afghanistan: Fresh fighting in final anti-Taliban strongholdFresh fighting has been reported in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remains out of the hands of the Taliban. One of the resistance leaders in the valley, Amrullah Saleh, dismissed reports that the Taliban had captured it as "baseless". But he admitted conditions are difficult, with the Taliban closing phone, internet and electricity lines. The fighting comes with the Taliban set to finalise a government. Panjshir Valley, north of the capital Kabul, is one of Afghanistan's smallest provinces and the only one not to have fallen...
__label__2 What Conservative Media is Missing in its Defenses of Kyle RittenhouseOPINIONLike almost every subject these days, the story of Kyle Rittenhouse has cut along partisan lines. Conservative media has come to his defense, some have almost deified him, while he has been vilified by left-wing legacy media with coverage that has been beyond disingenuous. That being said, right-wing media has omitted key details in its coverage of Rittenhouse, who is on trial for shooting three people, killing two of them, during riots last summer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. While right-wing media has rightfully focused on Rittenhouse appearing to have fired...

These entities are making Trump into an example of their power to frighten the half of America that supported him in November. We cannot allow them to intimidate us. But they sure are trying, and on some, they will succeed. They are using the excuse of an unrepresentative group of fools criminally ransacking U.S. Capitol offices with a lighter touch than many of this summer’s...
__label__3 Qatar and Turkey become Taliban's lifeline to the outside worldThe Taliban's celebratory gunfire crackled over Kabul as the West pulled out this week. But militancy alone is likely to leave the Taliban on its own - globally isolated, with millions of Afghans facing an even more uncertain future. The world's powers are now scrambling to exert influence amid the return of the country's Islamist rulers. And in the process two nations from the Arab and Muslim world have been emerging as key mediators and facilitators - Qatar and Turkey. Both are capitalising on a recent history of access to...
__label__1 Right-wing media have spent a year trying to discredit the 2020 presidential election in promotion of the Big LieOPINIONIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, former President Donald Trump and allied right-wing media figures worked hard to undermine the election results, using broad and debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud and supposed Democrats’ efforts to steal the vote. Protests against the election process, like Ali Alexander’s “Stop the Steal," were mobilized nationwide in the weeks before Election Day. And in the final presidential debate, Trump went as far as to baselessly claim,“This is going to be a fraud like you have never seen.”  The efforts have continued since the election. From November 3, 2020, to October 28, 2021, Media...
__label__5 Journalist Butchery of School Board Protests Upending Politics in Virginia and ElsewhereANALYSISThe media pile-on atop Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) for his comments Wednesday characterizing mock Nazi salutes at school board meetings as First Amendment–protected speech is not, unfortunately, an aberrational event when it comes to news coverage this fall of parents publicly registering their discontent with various contentious K-12 policies. Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__3 Before Afghan collapse, Biden pressed Ghani to ‘change perception’In the last call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Afghanistan counterpart before the Taliban seized control of the country, the leaders discussed military aid, political strategy and messaging tactics, but neither Biden nor Ashraf Ghani appeared aware of or prepared for the immediate danger of the entire country falling to insurgents, a transcript reviewed by Reuters shows. The men spoke for roughly 14 minutes on July 23. On August 15, Ghani fled the presidential palace, and the Taliban entered Kabul. Since then, tens of thousands of desperate Afghans have fled...

Where the article said that Eastman, a professor at Chapman Law School at the time, was helping President Donald Trump “to annul the voting processes and, by extension, the electoral college selections” of at least four states, Eastman substituted a less accusatory description. In his version, Trump...

On Sept. 16, the student was told that his membership in the "oppressive" Federalist Society had "triggered" his peers. On Sept. 17, he was reminded that "there’s a bar you have to take." The meetings came in response to an email the student had sent inviting classmates to a happy hour at his "trap house," which elicited allegations that he was planning a blackface party.

The survey, conducted before the U.S. military pullout was completed, also finds that 69% of the public says the United States mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. The public is also broadly critical of the Biden administration’s handling...
__label__2 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...

A lecture by a physicist was canceled at one of America’s premier institutions of science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for reasons having nothing to do with the subject of the lecture. The lecture was canceled not because of its scientific content but because of the politically incorrect views on diversity of the scientist scheduled to give the lecture. Dorian Abbot is a professor in the department of the geophysical sciences at the...

The Taliban celebrated at Kabul's airport on Tuesday with congratulatory messages and celebratory gunshots fired in the air, AFP reported. Newsweek previously broke the news that a U.S. Air Force C17 strategic transport aircraft left Afghanistan on Monday at 11:59 p.m. local time, close to President Joe Biden's August 31 deadline to end U.S. military presence in the country.

__label__2 Barstool Sports is a cesspool of misogyny and bigotryOPINIONBarstool Sports founder and frequent Fox News guest Dave Portnoy said he was in talks with a “major sport” to air games, later confirmed to be Major League Baseball.  The platform, described as a “satirical sports and men’s lifestyle blog” is, in reality, a cesspool of bigotry basking in the backlash against political correctness. Under the pretense of sharing funny videos and embracing a boys-will-be-boys mentality, Barstool has successfully normalized a culture of harassment, misogyny, and rampant misinformation, all while taking cavalier attitudes toward the chaos that ensues. Major League Baseball has recently demonstrated support for Black Lives Matter and is already...

St. Albans, whose alumni include vice presidents and two current U.S. senators, is considering a crackdown on "harmful" speech that prioritizes the impact of the speech rather than the intent of the speaker.

A total of 73 aircraft, nearly 100 vehicles and other equipment were abandoned by US troops as they pulled out ahead of the 31 August deadline. But US Central Command head Gen Kenneth McKenzie said it had all been rendered impossible to use. "Those aircraft will never fly again," he said. The aircraft abandoned in Kabul include: MD-530 helicopters, used for reconnaissance and close attack A-29 light attack planes

The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted...

Leilani Lutali received a letter on Sept. 28 informing her that the transplant team at the University of Colorado Hospital decided to designate her inactive on the waiting list for transplants. “You will be inactivated on the list for non-compliance by not receiving the COVID vaccine,” the letter states. If Lutali continues to refuse to get a vaccine, she “will be removed from the kidney transplant list,” it added. Neither...
__label__3 The lessons of AfghanistanThe end of America’s war in Afghanistan has prompted an enormous amount of finger-pointing and second-guessing among U.S. officials seeking to make sense of how a 20-year campaign to build up a stable Afghan government could be all but erased in a matter of weeks by the Taliban. U.S. involvement in the country — from the initial choice to invade to the swift withdrawal, and everything in between — will surely be debated for a long time. There are also questions about what the end of the war means for the people of...

But eight months into the new presidency, America's deep disunity might not be letting up.  A new poll has revealed that political divisions run so deep in the US that over half of Trump voters want red states to secede from the union, and 41% of Biden voters want blue states to split off.   According to the analysis from the University...
__label__3 It's 7 Months Into Biden's First Term, and Nearly 8 Percent of Humvees Ever Made Are Lost in Taliban's AfghanistanANALYSISThe Taliban inherited many American “gifts” amid their Afghanistan victory. We’ve seen the images of Islamic militants holding U.S.-made rifles and posing beside our own Blackhawk helicopters left behind in the wake of a disastrous withdrawal. We’ve also heard the speculation circling about — that with these “gifts,” the Taliban may have just toppled Vietnam as the 26th largest air force in the world. But now, there’s a new stat to boggle our minds: The Taliban is now in possession of the American military equipment that was gifted to Afghan security forces during the...
__label__2 The next big cyberthreat isn't ransomware. It's killware. And it's just as bad as it sounds.ANALYSISEven as most Americans are still learning about the hacking-for-cash crime of ransomware, the nation’s top homeland security official is worried about an even more dire digital danger: killware, or cyberattacks that can literally end lives. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in April galvanized the public’s attention because of its consumer-related complications, including long lines at gas stations, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with USA TODAY's Editorial Board last week. But, "there was a cyber incident that very fortunately did not succeed," he added. "And that is an attempted hack of a...

Students took the opportunity to skip class by staging a protest walkout, with some students cursing at school administrators and others crying, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Students took turns claiming they had been the victim of prejudice. Parkway Superintendent Keith Marty sent a letter to parents on the day of the walkout to condemn the racist messages. “Students and staff are hurt, angry and feeling outnumbered by those who seem willing to stand...

The media outlet reported that the group worked under cover of night on Wednesday, and in tandem with the United States military and embassy, to transfer hundreds of Afghans into a US military-controlled zone of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport. As many as 500 Afghan special operators, assets, enablers, and their families were handed over to the...

__label__5 School Forced Teacher to Take Down ‘Political’ Pro-Police Flag, Despite Allowing BLM SymbolsA teacher in Washington state was reportedly forced to remove a pro-police flag from her middle school classroom after administrators deemed it a “political message,” despite allowing messages in support of Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride flags to remain posted in the school. While the Marysville Middle School teacher wished to remain anonymous, her brother, Chris Sutherland, told The Jason Rantz Show that administrators told his sister it is “controversial” to display a “Thin Blue Line” flag in her classroom and that it “makes kids and staff feel unsafe.” The teacher had hung...
__label__3 The Real Reason U.S. Allies Are Upset About AfghanistanANALYSISMy last column pushed back at the chorus of doomsayers who insist that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan—including the disorderly manner in which it played out—had done vast and lasting damage to America’s international position. No doubt some of these commentators genuinely believe their dire pronouncements, and the Islamic State-Khorasan attack on the Kabul airport is bound to intensify those feelings. Even so, I still find the hyperbole and over-the-top rhetoric remarkable. This week, I want to dig deeper and consider why so many people—and especially observers in Europe—appear to see this...
__label__1 Misinformation on Facebook got six times more clicks than factual news during the 2020 election, study saysA new study of user behavior on Facebook around the 2020 election is likely to bolster critics’ long-standing arguments that the company’s algorithms fuel the spread of misinformation over more trustworthy sources. The forthcoming peer-reviewed study by researchers at New York University and the Université Grenoble Alpes in France has found that from August 2020 to January 2021, news publishers known for putting out misinformation got six times the amount of likes, shares, and interactions on the platform as did trustworthy news sources, such as CNN or the World Health...
__label__5 In Post-COVID Election, Democrats Claim They Fought To Open SchoolsOPINIONIn 2020, Americans’ lives were disrupted as teachers refused to work even as parents still had to go to their jobs. How would moms and dads manage to not get fired, while watching their kids all day and serving as de facto teachers? In some Democrat-controlled states, politicians did not seem to care. National statistics show that whether a school district was closed for an extended period was correlated less with how severe coronavirus was there, than the political power of unions. Shortly before the pandemic, Virginia state legislators expanded the power...

The review, done by the Air Force Lt. Gen.

__label__2 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...

__label__3 U.S. airstrike kills senior al-Qaeda leader in Syria, DOD saysA U.S. airstrike in northwest Syria on Friday killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. Why it matters: Syria serves as a "safe haven" for the extremist group to plan external operations, according to U.S. Army Maj. John Rigsbee. What they're saying: "The removal of this al-Qaeda senior leader will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out global attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians," Rigsbee said in the statement. U.S. Central Command currently has "no indications of civilian casualties." The...
__label__1 Barstool Sports is a cesspool of misogyny and bigotryOPINIONBarstool Sports founder and frequent Fox News guest Dave Portnoy said he was in talks with a “major sport” to air games, later confirmed to be Major League Baseball.  The platform, described as a “satirical sports and men’s lifestyle blog” is, in reality, a cesspool of bigotry basking in the backlash against political correctness. Under the pretense of sharing funny videos and embracing a boys-will-be-boys mentality, Barstool has successfully normalized a culture of harassment, misogyny, and rampant misinformation, all while taking cavalier attitudes toward the chaos that ensues. Major League Baseball has recently demonstrated support for Black Lives Matter and is already...

One of Elder’s staffers puts his arm on the Republican’s back and warns, “We’re getting egged from behind.” Moments later, someone launched a second egg toward the candidate and his team. The...
__label__3 The family of the 10 Afghans the Pentagon accidentally killed in a drone strike say the US hasn't offered them any compensationThe family of 10 Afghans killed in error by a US drone strike last month said the US hasn't offered them any compensation, CNN reported. Ten people, including seven children, died after a US drone hit a compound near Kabul on August 29. The Pentagon thought it had found an ISIS-K militant preparing a terror attack, but it had actually struck Zemari Ahmadi, an aid worker, and his family. Ahmadi had been observed loading boxes into his car, which the US military believed were full of explosives. Footage obtained by The New York Times showed that...
__label__1 How News Organizations Got Afghan Colleagues Out of KabulFor hours, they waited on the tarmac in the relentless heat, children and suitcases and strollers in tow, hoping for a flight to freedom that would not come. More than 200 Afghans from all walks of life — cooks, gardeners, translators, drivers, journalists — gathered on the runway of the Kabul airport, seeking escape from a country whose government had collapsed with shocking speed. When Taliban forces surged into the crowded airport, the group — local employees of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, along with...

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered a full-throated defense of two calls he made to his Chinese counterpart, saying he was responding to “concerning intelligence” that China was worried about a U.S. attack. “I know, I am certain, that President...

__label__3 The lessons of AfghanistanThe end of America’s war in Afghanistan has prompted an enormous amount of finger-pointing and second-guessing among U.S. officials seeking to make sense of how a 20-year campaign to build up a stable Afghan government could be all but erased in a matter of weeks by the Taliban. U.S. involvement in the country — from the initial choice to invade to the swift withdrawal, and everything in between — will surely be debated for a long time. There are also questions about what the end of the war means for the people of...

__label__5 GOP Reps Call on Top Biden Admin Officials To Testify on Bungled Afghanistan WithdrawalA coalition of Republican foreign policy leaders in Congress is demanding that senior Biden administration officials appear on Capitol Hill to be questioned about the bungled U.S. exit from Afghanistan, which cost American lives and left hundreds of Americans stranded in the Taliban-controlled country. Rep.

"The ideology of defunding the police, of destroying the oil and gas industry and the chaos at our border is disastrous for those of us who live here in South Texas." He's being...
__label__3 U.S. Exit From Afghanistan Seems Illogical; Why It’s Happening AnywayThe U.S. military hasn’t suffered a fatality in Afghanistan since February 2020—that is, for 16 months. So the tangible costs of staying in the country, at the reduced troop levels that had become the new normal, would have been relatively low. Meantime, the intangible risks of leaving, on humanitarian as well as strategic grounds, are relatively high. So what is it about the mood of America today that is compelling a departure? The question is largely rhetorical at this point, because the departure is happening. The Pentagon said last week...

__label__1 Mainstream media spin the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan to push for continued military occupationOPINIONSome coverage in mainstream print media and on cable networks of President Joe Biden’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan in August painted the plan as ill-advised or dangerous, ignoring 20 years of failed U.S. policy in the country. On July 8, Biden announced the decision to end military operations in Afghanistan by August 31, stating that even “one more year” of occupation would be a “recipe for fighting there indefinitely.” The U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, which has deployed troops inside the country since 2001, has been a disaster since the very beginning, resulting in...

__label__2 Biden Is About to Restart One of the Cruelest Parts of Trump’s Anti-Immigrant RegimeANALYSISUnder a court-mandated order, the Biden administration is gearing up to bring back a Trump-era border policy that pushed thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers into Mexico, to wait there for their hearings in US immigration courts. The move comes after a Trump-appointed federal judge sided with the states of Texas and Missouri in a lawsuit challenging the termination of the program and ordered the administration to reinstate it “in good faith.” The government is appealing the ruling and drafting a memo to once again rescind MPP, meanwhile, it’s also hiring contractors to rebuild tent courts in Laredo and Brownsville...

He sent two war jets to Syria where they dropped seven bombs on facilities used by Iran-supported militias. An estimated 17 people were killed.

Not a day goes by without the media comparing raucous school board meetings to the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, attributing the increase in parental outrage to racism and/or manipulation by cynical puppet masters, conducting laughably one-sided fact-checks, using the phrase "Republicans seize" unironically, and taking at face value...
__label__3 House passes defense spending bill with veto-proof majority despite Trump oppositionThe House voted 335-78 on Tuesday to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which authorizes a must-pass $740 million budget for defense spending. Why it matters: The vote was a veto-proof majority. But it remains unclear whether the same number of Republican would vote to override a presidential veto. The large number of GOP votes shows how strong the bipartisan support is for this legislation, which has passed every year without fail for more than half a century. President Trump has repeatedly foreshadowed a veto of the bill this...

A break-in was in progress. Amid the mayhem of protests over the killing of George Floyd, sensors on the plate-glass windows detected the repeated blows of people trying to smash their way inside the store. Mr. Warren quickly answered “yes” when the security company asked whether he wanted them to call the police.  A few minutes later, the company called...

Veteran Pentagon official Michèle Flournoy, who would have been the first woman to hold the position, had...

Just nine months into his term, President Joe Biden has already achieved something only predecessor Donald Trump managed before him: an average approval rating south of 45 percent in the third quarter of his first year. According to an Oct. 1-19 Gallup poll of 832 American adults released today, Biden was at 42 percent overall, down from 57 percent in January.

Both the law that is written on our hearts, often called the natural law, and the law of revelation, given unto Moses, show a standard of being fully human that, the apostle reminds his readers, only Jesus Christ has fulfilled. And so God became man so that man might become God, as the Athanasian formula puts it, because man...

At the same time, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Washington, has indicated that he expects progressive members would be prepared to fight for reductions. As a way to thread this needle, some observers have speculated that rather than cuts, there may be a greater emphasis on COVID or climate change impacts within the defense budget. What would a greater emphasis on climate change in the budget look like? It’s complicated. There’s no “climate...

__label__5 Some Republicans think this issue will tank their party in the midtermsANALYSISElections are about the future, so why are so many Republicans making next year’s midterms about the past? In races across the country, top Republican candidates are looking back to 2020 by either making “election integrity” a key part of their campaigns, supporting partisan audits even though earlier state-mandated audits found no evidence of widespread fraud, or questioning and in some cases denying the results of last year’s election. Election denialism is a good strategy for firing up a base that believes in false claims that former President Donald Trump’s...

That last one popped again recently with the release of my colleague Mollie Hemingway’s deeply reported 2020 election investigation book, “Rigged.” That book, and some great corroborating independent reporting, show that 2020 election chaos was part of an effective and well-funded plan to help Democrats win by rigging the playing field. One key strategy deployed to that end has become...

The U.S. military will soon roll out one such tool: a spray that can alert troops and first responders to the presence of such neurotoxins. Novichok, a Russian neurotoxin that GRU agents used against double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter...
__label__2 Decades After He Crossed Into The US, He’s Letting Other Immigrants Use His Borderland To Do The SameOciel Mendoza was just 18 when he crossed the US–Mexico border with a group of friends and traversed a 400-acre ranch in Texas in search of seasonal work as an undocumented immigrant. Little did he know, more than four decades later, he’d own the land and make it easier for others like him who are seeking a better life, much to the chagrin of US border officials. “I was undocumented once myself. Who am I to stop them?” Mendoza told BuzzFeed News. The border was a different place in 1979....
__label__4 Can the Government Hide Its Misdeeds as 'State Secrets'?ANALYSISThe terrorist attacks of September 11 and the government exploitation of them to expand civilian surveillance continue to cast a shadow over our civil liberties. Now the Supreme Court is considering whether officials can escape accountability for violating people's rights by claiming relevant information is too secret to be considered. The case, FBI v. Fazaga, involves surveillance of Muslim Americans in the years after the attacks, but it could determine the protections people will enjoy as the powers-that-be move on to finding other supposed domestic enemies in our midst. As the...
__label__3 Is the world on the brink of another nuclear arms race?The Japanese city of Nagasaki held a somber ceremony on Sunday to mark the 75th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing that killed 70,000 people in the waning days of World War II. The attack came just three days after the American military bombed Hiroshima, killing 140,000. These remain the only instances in which nuclear bombs have been used in war, but the specter of an apocalyptic conflict has hovered over international conflicts ever since. After a series of close calls in the 1950s and 1960s that led to the...
__label__1 Blinken Defends Biden’s Border Policy, Says U.S. Will Continue To Accept Migrant KidsSecretary of State Antony Blinken defended the Biden administration’s efforts to reform immigration policy amid an increase in undocumented migrants at the border with Mexico in an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday. President Joe Biden has been in office for just over 100 days, during which the number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has skyrocketed. In March alone, 170,000 people were taken into custody by U.S. officials, the most in nearly two decades. Republicans blame Biden’s efforts to undo ex-President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policy, saying...
__label__4 Yes, Biden Is Proposing That the IRS Spy on Your Bank RecordsOPINIONHere’s yet another example of why “fact-checking” is the most dishonest form of journalism. To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...
__label__3 As More Federal Agents Enter American Cities, Local Leaders Can’t Keep Them In LineAs the U.S. Justice Department starts sending more federal agents to big cities across the country, there’s good and bad news for their mayors and residents.The good news is that the feds in question are not the camo-clad unit that have created such an uproar in Portland by clashing violently with protesters. According to the Justice Department, the influx of agents will expand long-standing partnerships between city cops and agencies like the FBI. The campaign also includes $61 million worth of hiring grants for local officers.The bad news: City officials...
__label__2 Texas sues Biden administration in effort to reinstate Trump-era “remain in Mexico” immigration policyTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration Tuesday in an attempt to restore a policy put in place by former President Donald Trump that forced migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. Paxton and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt argue in the suit that the Biden administration’s move to suspend the so-called “remain in Mexico” policy was an “arbitrary and capricious decision.” The attorneys general are asking the court to reinstate the enforcement of the program nationwide and to...
__label__4 Dems Want to Soak the Rich by Snooping on the PoorOPINIONHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) snapped when asked Tuesday if the proposal to dramatically increase the surveillance capabilities of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would remain in the trillion-dollar social spending bill currently being negotiated among Democrats on Capitol Hill. "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes," the speaker said. Then she waved aside the questioner's accurate comment that banks have reported customer concerns about the idea that the IRS would scrutinize accounts with inflows and outflows as low as $600. "With all due respect, the plural of anecdote is not data," Pelosi said, disrespectfully. "Yes, there are...
__label__3 The ultimate high ground: Russia and US try to set rules for space weaponsRussian and U.S. negotiators met in Vienna this week to discuss a danger that has become increasingly urgent in recent years: how to curb the militarization of space. Unless a new treaty, or at least a general understanding, is soon established, experts say, the future of human activity on “the final frontier” is going to look more like Star Wars than Star Trek. There’s a lot to talk about. Last week the newly-minted U.S. Space Force accused Russia of deploying a “projectile weapon” in near-Earth orbit close to a U.S....
__label__2 Two big factors are making things worse at the border. But they're not getting much attentionThe devastating storms struck more than 1,000 miles away from the US-Mexico border, wiping out homes, crops and jobs. Now, months later, some migrants hoping to start over in the United States say the hurricanes are a big reason behind their decision to head north. "The house fell down all around us. Thank God my mom survived," a teenager from Guatemala tearfully told CNN as he took his first steps in the United States. "You always dream about living in a house with your children. Now we have...
__label__4 Department of Defense, military personnel now subject to automated 'continuous vetting' programThe vetting process for military and Department of Defense personnel is now "continuous" as it applies to checks for security clearance approval. The building of this effort is mostly waiting on the computer hardware side to fully catch up. Official lingo from the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) shortens "continuous vetting" to CV in their promotional material. It’s there the public learns that the Trusted Workforce 2.0 program intended to carry this CV process out was first launched in March 2018. It has been under development since then, with the...
__label__3 In Portland, the Baby Fascists Have Shown Their FaceOPINIONFascism was never about actual people and their predicaments but about a glorious imaginary collective that had died but would be reborn. In the 1920s and 1930s, the idea was everywhere the same: At some point in the past, the nation or the race had been greater, purer, more beautiful. That ancient perfection could be seen in ruins, poems, monuments. Then, so the story went, another group, some inferior race, some cabal had come along and inexplicably ruined the people’s destiny. If only that group could be removed, then the...
__label__2 Dozens injured as feminist protesters clash with police in Mexico’s capitalVolatile protests engulfed Mexico’s capital on Monday as police clashed with thousands of feminist activists calling for an end to what they say is a crisis of violence against women here. In Mexico City’s central square, known as the Zócalo, police tear-gassed protesters who defaced city office buildings and used crowbars and hammers to tear down parts of a 12-foot-tall steel barrier erected around the National Palace, the center of Mexico’s federal government and the home of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Authorities said at least 62 police officers...
__label__4 'Domestic Terrorism' Fears Will Be Used To Justify Increased Snooping and HarassmentOPINIONAfter the pro-Trump demonstrations and breach of the Capitol on January 6, the Biden administration is promising a new era of FBI snooping, harassment, and provocateuring. FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in a statement released on Tuesday that his FBI "has surged resources to our domestic terrorism investigations in the last year, increasing personnel by 260 percent." Those remarks are bad news for anybody who is worried about federal overreach. The events of January 6, Wray said, prove "a willingness by some to...
__label__3 Biden Administration to Order Federal Agencies to Fix Hundreds of Cyber FlawsThe Biden administration on Wednesday is expected to issue a sweeping new order mandating that nearly all federal agencies patch hundreds of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are considered major risks for damaging intrusions into government computer systems, officials said. The new requirement is one of the most wide-reaching cybersecurity mandates ever imposed on the federal government. It covers about 200 known security flaws identified by cybersecurity professionals between 2017 and 2020 and an additional 90 discovered in 2021 alone that have generally been observed being used by malicious hackers, according to a draft...
__label__2 Biden meets with Mexican president amid growing pressure on immigrationPresident Biden met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Monday amid growing pressure to find a workable immigration policy, as he faces criticism from liberal Democrats for detaining migrant children and accusations from Republicans that he is recklessly throwing open the nation’s borders amid a pandemic. Biden and López Obrador issued a joint declaration affirming their will to cooperate on migration issues, particularly the long-term goal of creating more jobs in southern Mexico and Central America. But whether Biden can get Mexico’s immediate help to contain the growing...
__label__4 Biden's Plan To Crack Down on Tax Cheating: Snooping on Everyone's Bank AccountsANALYSISIn order to make sure the rich are paying their fair share in taxes, President Joe Biden says the IRS just needs two bits of information: all the money that goes into your bank account, and all the money that comes out. That's how Biden pitched his plan for a more comprehensive financial surveillance state—all to catch those nasty tax-cheating rich folks, of course—during a speech from the White House on Thursday afternoon. The plan "will give the IRS the resources it needs to keep up with the lawyers and...
__label__3 Four U.S. Intelligence Agencies Produced Extensive Reports on Afghanistan, but All Failed to Predict Kabul’s Rapid CollapseLeading U.S. intelligence agencies failed to predict the rapid Taliban takeover of Afghanistan prior to the final withdrawal of American troops and instead offered scattershot assessments of the staying power of the Afghan military and government, a review of wide-ranging summaries of classified material by The Wall Street Journal shows. The nearly two dozen intelligence assessments from four different agencies haven’t been previously reported. The assessments charted Taliban advances from spring 2020 through this July, forecasting that the group would continue to gain ground and that the U.S.-backed government in Kabul was...
__label__2 Mexico Cries Foul at Natural Gas Cutoff Ordered by Texas GovernorThe Mexican government said on Thursday that it was working to reverse an order from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas to restrict natural gas exports, part of that state’s effort to resolve widespread power outages that have left millions of Texans without electricity in the middle of a deadly winter storm. Mr. Abbott’s order has heightened tensions between the two countries, with top Mexican officials protesting the governor’s decision to cut off gas supplies just as Mexico works to resolve its own mass power outages as a result of the...
__label__5 The Tyranny Of Smartphones And Dumb Covid PassportsOPINIONIn a striking passage near the beginning of his contribution to the Penguin History of the Church, R.W. Southern writes: The identification of the church with the whole of organized society is the fundamental feature which distinguishes the Middle Ages from earlier and later periods of history. At its widest limits it is a feature of European history from the fourth to the eighteenth century—from Constantine to Voltaire. In theory, during the whole of this period only orthodox and obedient believers could enjoy the full rights of citizenship. … Just as...
__label__3 Jake Sullivan discussed Saudi-Israel normalization with MBSWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised normalization with Israel during his recent meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, three U.S. and Arab sources tell Axios. Why it matters: Saudi Arabia would be the biggest regional player to sign onto the "Abraham Accords" peace agreement with Israel, and such a major breakthrough would likely convince other Arab and Muslim countries to follow suit. Behind the scenes: During the Sept. 27 meeting in Neom, a futuristic planned city on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast, Sullivan raised the issue and bin...
__label__1 Biden retains Trump's border rules for now, with migrants stuck in Mexico or facing expulsionPerla, 46, a Nicaraguan political dissident, has been living with her daughter and grandchildren in a squalid migrant tent camp in the Mexican border city of Matamoros for a year and half.  A former local councilwoman who was threatened for publicly opposing Daniel Ortega's regime, Perla is waiting for a U.S. immigration judge to adjudicate her asylum request, with her final court hearing postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic. "It's been really difficult. You don't know what can happen to you here," she told CBS News in Spanish....
__label__4 The USPS' Semi-Secret Internet Surveillance ApparatusANALYSISPop quiz: Which federal agency runs a social media surveillance unit known as the Internet Covert Operations Program (iCOP)? If you guessed the FBI, the CIA, or the Department of Homeland Security—sorry. This one belongs to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). And through it, postal inspectors have been monitoring social media platforms about U.S. protests, using tools that include a facial recognition database. That the agency best known for delivering mail has a side hustle in online snooping took a lot of people by surprise when it was reported in...
__label__3 North Korea Test-Fires Another Ballistic Missile Hours After U.S. Offers To Restart DialogNorth Korea test-fired a ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday, according to the South Korean and Japanese militaries, signaling a continuation of its recent weapon tests which comes just hours after a U.S. official called for efforts to restart dialog with Pyongyang. The launch of the ballistic missile took place near the city of Sinpo—where North Korea docks its submarines—the South Korean military said without offering details about the type or range of the ballistic missile. Despite this, the site of the missile launch has led South Korean officials...
__label__1 New report details Trump effort to seize thousands of acres of private land for border wallThe Trump administration acquired at least 135 tracts of private land to build barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border and planned to seize a total of 5,275 acres to fulfill President Trump's campaign pledge, according to a government watchdog report obtained by CBS News. A study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress' independent investigative arm, found that the Trump administration had secured the 135 sections of private land along the southern border as of July by reaching agreements with the owners or taking them to court and seizing their property....
__label__4 It Increasingly Looks Like Tucker Carlson’s Private Emails Were Leaked To The Media By The GovernmentA report released Wednesday is shedding further light into Tucker Carlson’s bombshell allegation that the National Security Agency (NSA) obtained his private communications. The Fox News host and Daily Caller co-founder was communicating with U.S.-based Kremlin intermediaries regarding a potential interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Axios, which reportedly spoke to two sources “familiar with Carlson’s communications.” “As I’ve said repeatedly, because it’s true, the NSA read my emails and then leaked their contents. That’s an outrage, as well as illegal,” Carlson told Axios in a statement. Carlson first made the...
__label__3 Police outnumber protesters at right-wing Capitol rallyA few hundred protesters gathered around the US Capitol on Saturday, for a rally in support of the pro-Trump rioters who ransacked the building on 6 January. But the group were easily outnumbered by the police and journalists present. Ahead of the event, police said they had detected "threats of violence" and security was tightened in Washington. Organisers had a permit for 700 to attend, but only about 100 to 200 protesters turned up, Reuters reports. Capitol Police said 400 to 450 people were inside the protest area - but...
__label__2 DOJ Wants to Drop All Charges Against Ex-Mexican Defense Secretary Accused of Drug CrimesIn a stunning move, the Justice Department said Tuesday it wanted to drop all charges against former Mexican Defense Secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda—and will allow him to return to Mexico where he will apparently be investigated. Attorney General William Bar, in a joint statement with the Mexican Attorney General’s Office, said the decision to drop drug trafficking and money laundering charges against Cienfuegos was “in the interests of demonstrating our united front against all forms of criminality.” Cienfuegos—who was also known as “El Padrino” or “The Godfather”—was arrested in...
__label__4 Kevin McCarthy backs NSA probe after Tucker Carlson spying claimsHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has asked the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee to probe Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s allegations that the National Security Agency is spying on him. McCarthy (R-Calif.) made the announcement Wednesday, in which he also bemoaned a “disturbing trend” he said he had seen “[f]or the past several months” at the NSA. The top-ranking House Republican began by referencing a letter he sent Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin regarding his concerns about “the politicization of the Agency through the sidelining of Michael Ellis as NSA General...
__label__3 US general defends 'secret' phone calls with ChinaTop US General Mark Milley has defended himself after a book reported he had "secret" phone calls with China amid concerns about then-President Donald Trump. The calls last October and January were to reassure the Chinese military, Gen Milley said on Wednesday. Mr Trump said the claims were fabricated and Republicans have called for the general to be fired. President Joe Biden said he has "great confidence" in Gen Milley. Gen Milley's spokesman said that the calls were in keeping with his "duties and responsibilities conveying reassurance in order to...
__label__1 Trump is still falsely claiming that Mexico is paying for his border wallFACT CHECKIn 2016, President Donald Trump promised at his campaign rallies that Mexico would pay for the giant wall he planned to build on its border. Running for reelection four years later, the President is now declaring at his rallies that Mexico is indeed paying for the wall. "And by the way, Mexico is paying," Trump said at a rally in Sanford, Florida, on Monday. "They hate to say it: Mexico is paying for it." "And Mexico is paying for the wall, by the way. You know that. I've been saying...
__label__4 So Long as You Carry a Cellphone, the Government Can Track YouANALYSISCell phones are convenient devices, handily connecting us with loved ones, paying bills, accessing information—and treacherously reporting on our every move. Worse, even after the Supreme Court weighed in, many government agencies still insist that they have the right to pull up that tracking data to see our whereabouts. It's increasingly apparent that, if you have your phone in your pocket, you may as well have a GPS beacon strapped to your ankle. If you want anonymity from the government, leave the gadget at home. That point was illustrated in...
__label__3 Questions About Security Around The Capitol Complex Emerge After Bomb ThreatThe confrontation between authorities and a man who pulled up next to the Library of Congress claiming to have a bomb in his truck ended with his peaceful surrender on Thursday afternoon. It took hours of negotiations and at least three law enforcement agencies — the U.S. Capitol Police, the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — to safely persuade Floyd Ray Roseberry to stop ranting about a "revolution" and turn himself over to authorities. But the ease with which Roseberry gained such close access to the sidewalk next to...
__label__2 Biden’s misleading announcement that the United States is no longer at warANALYSISDuring a speech at the United Nations on Sept. 21, President Joe Biden referenced the end of the Afghanistan War, claiming that the United States had finally returned to a peace footing after 20-years of armed conflict.  "​​I stand here today, for the first time in 20 years, with the United States not at war," he said. "We’ve turned the page." The reality is more complicated than that. The withdrawal of the last U.S. troops from Afghanistan on Aug. 30 brought an end to the longest war in American history....
__label__4 Is Bank of America Giving Away Customer Data Without Consent?FACT CHECKDuring his show on February 4, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that Bank of America is “without the knowledge or the consent of its customers, sharing private information with federal law enforcement agencies.” Carlson explained how “at the request of federal investigators, Bank of America searched its databases looking for people who fit a specific profile” of those who may have participated in the storming of the Capitol on January 6.  According to Carlson, investigators were looking for people who made transactions in D.C. on or around the...
__label__3 NSA watchdog to investigate Tucker Carlson's allegations he was spied onThe National Security Agency's inspector general announced Tuesday that it is investigating allegations that the NSA "improperly targeted the communications of a member of the U.S. news media." Why it matters: Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed in June that a whistleblower had informed him NSA was monitoring his electronic communications "in an attempt to take this show off the air." The agency issued a statement at the time saying Carlson "has never been an intelligence target." What they're saying: "The OIG is examining NSA's compliance with applicable legal authorities and agency policies and procedures regarding collection, analysis,...
__label__2 America left the Taliban in Afghanistan with a valuable weapon: dataOPINIONOn Sept. 10, 2001, David Tyson — the only CIA officer fluent in Uzbek, the language spoken by more than 1 million Afghans at the time — was desperately trying to prevent a cache of United States-made Stinger missiles from falling into the hands of terrorists. But Toby Harnden's new book, “First Casualty: The Untold Story of the CIA Mission To Avenge 9/11,” detailed how, according to the CIA’s tally, the Taliban already had several dozen missiles; 600 of roughly 2,500 remained unaccounted for. Warfare had changed since the U.S. had secretly...
__label__5 Don’t Trust Those ‘Secure’ Messaging AppsANALYSISRecent political turmoil has driven a stampede of smartphone users to encrypted messaging services, so much so that service providers are having a hard time keeping up with demand. The exodus to these digital havens might come across as reasonable given social media’s newfound penchant for censorship and deplatforming. However, the public record shows that encrypted messaging apps, despite the litany of high-profile celebrity endorsements, aren’t what they appear to be. Lurking beneath the assurances of confidentiality are unsettling facts that raise doubts about the wisdom of following the herd....
__label__3 A New Tunnel Is Spotted At A Chinese Nuclear Test SiteChina appears to be expanding its sprawling nuclear weapons testing complex in the nation's western desert. Satellite imagery shared exclusively with NPR shows a possible new tunnel being dug and fresh roads added at the site, known as Lop Nur, where China has tested its nuclear weapons in the past. "This is new construction linked to areas that have in the past supported nuclear test activities," says Renny Babiarz, vice president for analysis and operations at AllSource Analysis, a private geospatial analysis firm that spotted the tunnel using satellite imagery from...
__label__2 At least four killed in Taliban crackdown on protests, says UNThe Taliban’s violent crackdown on protests against their hardline rule has already led to four documented deaths, according to a UN human rights official who said the group had used live ammunition, whips and batons to break up demonstrations. Ravina Shamdasani, the UN’s rights spokesperson, told a briefing in Geneva that it had also received reports of house-to-house searches for those who participated in the protests. The protests against the Taliban’s return to power, many of which have been led by women fearful of their status under the Islamist group,...
__label__4 Survey: Two-Thirds Unfazed Smart Devices Always ListeningTwo-thirds of Americans are unconcerned personal Internet-connected devices could be recording them in some way, according a survey by the website Safety.com. Of 1,091 adults over the age of 18 surveyed, 66.7% said they did not care if their home smart device, such as Amazon's virtual assistant "Alexa," which is activated by a voice command, was always listening, the website reported. Women were more concerned than men by more than 7%, older adults such as baby boomers were more concerned than millennials or those in Generation Z, while Generation X...
__label__3 Trump ally Barrack allowed to remain free ahead of lobbying trialA judge in Los Angeles on Friday signed off on a deal that allows former U.S. President Donald Trump’s billionaire ally Thomas Barrack to be released from custody while he awaits trial on charges of illegal lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Under the agreement approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue, Barrack will wear an ankle bracelet that tracks his location, surrender his passport and submit to a curfew. The agreement, reached with prosecutors, also calls for Barrack to put up a $250 million bond, secured by...
__label__1 GOP douses Afghanistan withdrawal with misinformationANALYSISThe Afghanistan withdrawal has gone poorly enough for the Biden administration, and it did itself no favors with its faulty predictions about how it would be carried out. But even in the midst of the worst stretch of the Biden presidency thus far, the lure of misinformation has proved irresistible to its GOP critics. They’ve trafficked repeatedly in recent days in false, misleading or unproved allegations involving the Taliban hanging someone from an American helicopter, President Biden skipping a ceremony for 13 Americans killed last week, military dogs being left behind, and...
__label__4 Give Everyone a Barcode? China Trying to Use COVID Fears to Launch Global Tracking System for HumansChina's communist leader Xi Jinping is calling for countries across the world to accept a global COVID-19 tracking system that uses QR codes in an attempt to expedite international travel. Xi proposed the concept during a virtual G20 leaders' meeting on Saturday, noting that this "global mechanism" uses an electronic barcode that would help determine a traveler's health status, according to China's government-run "news" agency. "China has proposed a global mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates based on nucleic acid test results in the form of internationally accepted...
__label__3 Trump inaugural committee head accused of being UAE agentThe chair of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee was arrested Tuesday on charges alleging he secretly conspired to influence U.S. policy to benefit the United Arab Emirates, even while he was seeking a position as an American diplomat. Tom Barrack, 74, of Santa Monica, California, was among three men charged in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, with acting as unregistered foreign agents as they tried to influence U.S. policy on the UAE’s behalf while Trump was running in 2016 and later while he was president.
__label__1 With last plane out of Kabul, America's 20-year war in Afghanistan is overThe final U.S. troops in Afghanistan flew out of Kabul Monday at 3:29 p.m. EDT, ending a costly 20-year occupation that started after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and leaving a war-torn country now run by the Taliban. The retreat, announced by the Pentagon, came one minute before Aug. 31 Kabul time, keeping the U.S. in the country right up until a deadline set by President Joe Biden's administration. “Now, our 20-year military presence in Afghanistan has ended," Biden said in a statement, calling it the "unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs and of all of our commanders...
__label__4 NSA Ruling Reminds Us That Sacrificing Civil Liberties in the Name of National Security Is a Bipartisan ImpulseANALYSISThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit yesterday ruled that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records was illegal and probably unconstitutional. For Democrats who see Donald Trump as an unprecedented threat because of his disregard for the Constitution, the decision is a useful reminder that sacrificing civil liberties on the altar of national security is a bipartisan rite. The NSA program, which was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, indiscriminately collected telephone "metadata"—indicating who was calling whom and how long they...
__label__3 The Real-Life Risks of Our Digital WorldANALYSISIf we didn’t know already, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven home the fact that data is the most important strategic asset of the 21st century. Never has the world depended more on digital data flows as when millions of workers and students switched to remote access and when online retail took the place of shuttered stores. As much as our digital interconnectedness is powering innovation, commerce, and interaction, it is also generating new risks and vulnerabilities. This is because the digital systems on which we all depend—the internet, cloud computing,...
__label__1 I Taught English to Afghan Soldiers. Now I’m Part of the “Digital Dunkirk” Trying to Get Them Out.OPINIONAs the US began its chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan last week, I couldn’t stop thinking about the many Afghans who have aided American forces and are now stuck in the country, potentially with targets on their backs. A family friend of mine, Joan Barker, worked closely with Afghan special forces and interpreters during her time as a military English teacher there; we connected by phone earlier this week.  I’m an English-as-a-second-language teacher who’s taught on military bases overseas, including in Afghanistan from August 2017 to August 2018. Over the past couple...
__label__4 Was the Trump Campaign Going to Use a ‘Spy Gadgets’ on a Blimp to Collect Voter Data?FACT CHECKIt’s not crazy to think that Donald Trump might deploy a blimp over swing states to advertise for his re-election campaign. But would he use “state-of-the art spy gadgets” to collect data on those living below?  That was the claim of a post by America Web Media first published in March. The article was shared again by America Web Media on Sunday, and received more than 100,000 views across various AWM Facebook pages within 24 hours. And in fact, the Trump campaign was, at one point, planning to send...
__label__3 US companies hit by 'colossal' cyber-attackAbout 200 US businesses have been hit by a "colossal" ransomware attack, according to a cyber-security firm. Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a "potential attack". Huntress Labs said it believed the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal agency, said in a statement that it was taking action to address the attack. The cyber-breach emerged on Friday afternoon as...
__label__2 What Trump’s Disgraceful Deal With the Taliban Has WroughtOPINIONBelieving you’re uniquely capable of bending things to your will is practically a requirement for becoming president of the United States. But too often, in pursuit of such influence over foreign policy, presidents overemphasize the importance of personal diplomacy. Relationships among leaders can build trust — or destroy it — but presidents often overrate their ability to steer both allies and adversaries. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had built such a solid relationship that during the Reykjavik summit most of Reagan’s administration worried he would agree to an unverifiable elimination of nuclear...
__label__4 Why COVID-19 is spiking in highly vaccinated statesANALYSISThe coronavirus pandemic is still going. And as we head into the winter months, there are a number of questions about what might happen in states with high vaccination rates and mitigation measures. Some highly vaccinated states have seen massive coronavirus surges as of late, which might be a sign of what’s to come in the pandemic, according to Yahoo! News. What happens to the infected people in the upcoming days and weeks may be a signal of what to expect this winter and beyond. “The question now is whether above-average vaccination coverage and...
__label__2 Biden-Putin summit: At frosty moment, ‘glimmers of confidence’Will the Biden-Putin summit in Geneva help the United States and Russia get beyond mistrust to a stable and predictable relationship? Meeting face to face was important, both men said. To see the alternating American and Russian flags fluttering in unison on both sides of Geneva’s famed Pont du Mont Blanc – the city’s signature white swans peacefully plying the clear lake waters below – is to imagine the two countries represented by those national symbols seeing eye to eye and finding common ground on pressing global issues. But looks,...
__label__1 Wait, Is the U.S. Allied With the Taliban Against ISIS Now?There’s an odd historical resonance the fact that Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting Vietnam as the scenes of chaos, bloodshed, and desperation play out in Afghanistan this week. For Americans, the evacuation of Kabul resembles, and has frequently been compared to, that of Saigon 46 years ago. Depending on your political persuasion, both are humiliating surrenders, the inevitable results of American hubris, or some combination of the two. But there may be lessons for Afghanistan’s new rulers as well. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party were once seen as such a grave threat to...
__label__5 Consider the PharmacistOPINIONOnce upon a time, pharmacists were recognized as an important part of the healthcare chain. Your local pharmacist was someone you knew and trusted. They knew a lot, worked hard, and sometimes held your life in their hands. And because of this they were well compensated. Today, pharmacists are being turned into glorified Amazon pickers. All because of the expanding pharmacy monopoly.1 Matt Stoller has a rundown of a workers’ rights movement that has emerged in pharmacist world. It’s called #PizzaIsNotWorking and I had never heard of it until I read...
__label__3 From China to cyber, has Biden agenda reinvigorated NATO?President Joe Biden’s approach to international alliances and shared values has helped inject a renewed sense of purpose into NATO. But could its focus become too diffuse? Atmospherics and style are not everything. But in bringing his commitment to America’s alliances to the NATO summit Monday, along with his conviction that democracies are best suited to meet the 21st century’s stiff challenges, President Joe Biden went a good way toward answering a question hanging over the North Atlantic alliance since the end of the Cold War: What are you good...

__label__3 Ransomware attacks: How should the U.S. respond?Ransomware attacks are increasingly targeting companies’ computer systems, demanding money in exchange for returning access and data. Last month, hackers breached Colonial Pipeline — which supplies 100 million gallons of fuel daily along a 5,500-mile pipeline — and gained access to its business networks. In response, Colonial shut down pipeline operations, which led to nearly a week of widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast. The CEO of Colonial Pipeline testified before a Senate committee last week, explaining his decision to pay a multimillion-dollar ransom to regain access: “I made the decision...

A booster stack, which is the rocket used to accelerate the projectile to hypersonic speeds, failed and the test of the projectile, the hypersonic glide body, could not proceed, the statement said. Because the rocket failed the Pentagon was not able to test the hypersonic glide body, which is the key component needed to develop a hypersonic weapon. Officials have started a review of...
__label__5 The FDA Shouldn’t Cut Corners on Child Vax SafetyOPINIONBefore parents consent to vaccinate their children against COVID, basic medical ethics requires that they be informed of how safe the vaccine is. Yet in a shocking on-video admission, Dr. Eric Rubin, an advisory-committee member to the FDA, said this during an official FDA hearing about the COVID vaccine in children five to eleven: “We’re never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.” No, Dr. Rubin, that isn’t “the way it goes.” American children deserve better than that. Despite the...
__label__3 Reporter’s notebook: How Biden’s 5 predecessors fared on NATO stageThe performances of the last five presidents at NATO summits have molded and influenced how Europe views the alliance’s leader – and the United States. Our reporter witnessed them all. The group of British journalists having a little fun at the expense of the American president – George H.W. Bush – had a point. The year was 1989, and the world was fast becoming aware of what Americans already knew: Mr. Bush didn’t always have a smooth way with words. So, after a meeting of NATO heads of state, when...
__label__2 US Empire Is Lining the Pockets of Defense ContractorsOPINIONThe costs and consequences of the United States’s twenty-first-century wars have by now been well-documented — a staggering $8 trillion in expenditures and more than 380,000 civilian deaths, as calculated by Brown University’s Costs of War project. The question of who has benefited most from such an orgy of military spending has, unfortunately, received far less attention. Corporations large and small have left the financial feast of that post-9/11 surge in military spending with genuinely staggering sums in hand. After all, Pentagon spending has totaled an almost unimaginable $14 trillion plus since the start...

Bastian said announcing a plan to get all employees vaccinated, without enforcing a mandate, has worked, allowing the company to reach a 90% vaccination rate. “The reason the mandate was put in by [the] president, I believe, was because they wanted to make sure companies had a plan to get their employees vaccinated,” the CEO said, according to Fox Business. “A month before the president came out with...

A barrage of 15 rockets in northern Iraq that struck a US base, killing a military contractor and wounding a soldier, were likely aimed as much at testing the new president’s mettle as they were at causing damage. In the hours after the attack on Erbil airport, where much of the remaining US presence in Iraq is based, a Shia group loyal to Iran felt emboldened enough to claim it. Although the boast was from a hitherto unknown group, it left...
__label__5 Public Health Officials Blew Up Their Credibility, and We're Paying the PriceOPINIONWith COVID-19 still sickening and killing people even though effective vaccines have been widely available for all since the spring, it's frustrating to see vaccination rates creep up only slowly against a head-wind of widespread resistance. It's even more frustrating that much of that resistance can be attributed to self-inflicted wounds on the part of public health experts and government officials. Having effectively discarded their own credibility since the beginning of the pandemic, the powers-that-be find that much of the population no longer places faith in what they have to say. "Why...

The change illustrates how one taxpayer-backed effort to battle the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans, was instead diverted toward patching up long-standing perceived gaps in military supplies. The Cares Act, which Congress passed earlier this year, gave the Pentagon money to “prevent, prepare for,...

__label__3 North Korea breaks off nuclear talks with U.S. in SwedenSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - North Korea’s top negotiator said late on Saturday that working-level nuclear talks in Sweden between officials from Pyongyang and Washington had been broken off, dashing prospects for an end to months of stalemate. The North’s chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, who spent much of the day in talks with an American delegation, cast the blame on what he portrayed as U.S. inflexibility, saying the other side’s negotiators would not “give up their old viewpoint and attitude”. “The negotiations have not fulfilled our expectation and finally broke...
__label__2 Climate Change Will Force Us to Rethink Migration and AsylumANALYSISAs climate change accelerates, it will become increasingly untenable to reduce US immigration and asylum policy to a question of border security. More than 170,000 migrants were apprehended at the US-Mexico border in March, the highest number in a decade. Many of those are unaccompanied minors, and the Biden administration has scrambled to find accommodations for them, sending hundreds of kids to temporary shelters in convention centers and other ad hoc facilities. Conservative politicians and pundits have blamed Biden for “luring children to the border” by relaxing Donald Trump’s harsh...
__label__4 Black voters in two of America’s most liberal cities sour on calls to ‘defund the police’Marques Warren got a late-night phone call at his Seattle home last year during racial justice riots, and it turned him against the idea of “defund the police.”  The call came from the security alarm company for the liquor store he owns downtown. A break-in was in progress. Amid the mayhem of protests over the killing of George Floyd, sensors on the plate-glass windows detected the repeated blows of people trying to smash their way inside the store. Mr. Warren quickly answered “yes” when the security company asked whether he wanted them to call the police.  A few minutes later, the company called...

He told me that there is a lot of stress on professors at his university regarding grading students of color. He said everyone is afraid of being accused of...

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited him to deliver a guest lecture on climate change, then canceled the talk due to campus outrage over his views. Notably, it was not Abbot's views on climate change that prompted the student, staff, and alumni revolt. It was his views on affirmative action: He had publicly criticized race-based personnel decisions in higher education. His views on these issues are not outside the mainstream—a majority of the voters in California, of all places, also...

She was raised in New Orleans, a city dominated by Catholicism and its symbols, but her church was anti-Catholic. She's black, but her first steps into identity politics and activism were in opposition to antisemitism. And even with her religious upbringing, it was something an agnostic professor said that provoked her eureka moment. So it's perhaps unsurprising that her approach to anti-racism is different from that of best-selling leftist consultants...

__label__2 Armored Cars, Robots and Coal: North Korea Defies U.S. by Evading SanctionsWASHINGTON — North Korea has evaded United Nations sanctions for many months by exporting coal, sand and petroleum, and importing luxury goods including armored sedans, alcohol and robotic machinery. The findings are based on an upcoming U.N. report, other assessments using satellite images and shipping data, and interviews with analysts. The exports provide North Korea with money to continue developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, analysts say. And the imports of luxury goods show techniques that North Korea might also be using to procure dual-use technology for those...

From that perspective, the partial expiration of the Patriot Act a week ago and the subsequent passage of surveillance reform legislation might seem like a decisive victory against mass surveillance.

__label__4 Corporate Media Don’t Understand Religion For The Same Reason They Don’t Understand America: PoliticsOPINIONIt's no wonder the left and its defenders and scribes in corporate media don't understand Catholicism. Through the lens of American politics, how could they? Newspaper readers and news-watchers these past few weeks have been treated to a running analysis from pundits and reporters on whether Catholic politicians should be under different rules than the other billion less-famous Catholics. It’s not shocking that The New York Times and their friends think the Catholic Church ought to abandon millennia of moral teaching to suit Western left-wing policies, but a funny thing...

__label__3 As Iran nuclear talks resume, U.S. hopes for a deal riseLast week's round of indirect nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran in Vienna was the first in which progress was made on both negotiating tracks, sanctions relief and nuclear measures, U.S. officials say. Breaking it down: The working group focusing on sanctions relief required of the U.S. to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal had made steady progress in the first three rounds. But the other, focusing on the nuclear measures required of Iran, stalled due to Iran's hardline positions and the question of what happens to Iran's...

__label__3 Reviving the Nuclear Deal Gives the U.S. More Leverage Over IranOPINIONAs officials in Washington consider returning to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, much of the debate has centered on whether the U.S. government will lose leverage. Some experts and officials argue that if the Biden administration rejoins the deal—also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—the United States will squander the leverage built in recent years through former President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure strategy. While U.S. sanctions have caused Iran’s economy major challenges and limited Iran’s access to financial resources, they have not succeeded in changing Tehran’s behavior...

When Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, he will have to contend with the reality that Iran has 12 times the amount of enriched uranium that it did in 2018, and that its estimated "breakout" time to build the bomb has dropped from 12 months to three to four months, according...

The policy change requires shelters to accommodate individuals regardless of sex or gender orientation.

Foreign reporters at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east said they had witnessed a huge blast. Pyongyang later said the site had been dismantled. The move by the North was seen as part of a diplomatic rapprochement with South Korea and the US.

It's an often-repeated line from him, but there was one change in U.S. policy Wednesday: Trump called for other world powers to abandon the nuclear accord, which is barely surviving after he withdrew the U.S. in 2018 and Iran has unraveled its cooperation since 2019.

The new approach focuses on so-called “harm reduction” measures that promote safe drug use over abstinence and the threat of imprisonment. On Monday, the Office of National Drug Control Policy announced a $2.5 million grant to draft model laws to support such harm reduction programs, increase drug treatment options, and reform criminal statutes that have harmed people of color in particular. It’s the federal drug policy office’s latest shift away...
__label__5 House Republicans Probe Climate Groups’ Ties to ChinaA pair of top House Republicans demanded information from several progressive organizations on their ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, ranking member on the oversight and investigations subcommittee, wrote letters Sunday to four left-wing climate-focused groups with a series of questions. The groups—the Sunrise Movement, the Union of Concerned Scientists, MoveOn, and Earthworks—had asked the Biden administration in a July letter to “eschew the dominant antagonistic approach” toward China and work with it on combating climate change....
__label__2 Justice Department sues Walmart, alleging role in opioid crisisThe Trump administration sued Walmart on Tuesday, accusing its pharmacies of not properly screening questionable painkiller prescriptions and filling them, ultimately fueling nationwide addiction. Why it matters: The major retailer "knowingly filled thousands of controlled substance prescriptions that were not issued for legitimate medical purposes or in the usual course of medical practice," the Justice Department alleges. The state of play: Walmart's network of 5,000 in-store pharmacies were turned into America's leading supplier of highly addictive painkillers, dating back to 2013, per the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the...
__label__2 The opioid epidemic isn’t unsolvableANALYSISLast week, we got some terrible news: In 2020, the number of drug overdose deaths in the US reached their highest point ever recorded — more than 93,000, according to preliminary federal data. And then this week, we got some more terrible news: Life expectancy in the US fell by 1.5 years — the worst decline since World War II. Most of that was due to Covid-19. But some of it was driven by the increase in overdoses. All of that is to say that America is currently dealing with a big overdose...
__label__5 America thinks the unthinkable: More than half of Trump voters and 41% of Biden supporters want red and blue states to SECEDE from one another and form two new countries, shock new poll findsMany breathed a sigh of relief when President Biden was elected, not for policy but for a reunification of the country after four years of tumult and fiery division under President Trump. But eight months into the new presidency, America's deep disunity might not be letting up.  A new poll has revealed that political divisions run so deep in the US that over half of Trump voters want red states to secede from the union, and 41% of Biden voters want blue states to split off.   According to the analysis from the University...
__label__3 Should all drugs be decriminalized?Oregon could become the first state in the nation to decriminalize illicit drugs — including opioids, meth and cocaine — if voters approve a ballot measure on Tuesday. The proposal, Measure 110, would remove criminal penalties for possession and use of small amounts of drugs. Drugs would still be illegal, but offenders would be given the option of paying a $100 fine or attending a health assessment at an addiction treatment center rather than jail time. Selling and manufacturing drugs would remain criminal acts. The measure will also divert money...
__label__2 Hunter Biden, in new memoir, offers lurid details of addiction but sidesteps some political scandalsAfter a year of withering attacks from President Donald Trump and his allies during the 2020 campaign, Hunter Biden has emerged with a new memoir that seeks to reframe some of the scandals that nearly derailed his father's presidential bid -- but he almost entirely ignores others, leaving questions about the nation's First Family unresolved. In "Beautiful Things," out next week, Hunter Biden charts a life defined by tragedy, addiction and scandal -- all in the shadow of a doting and concerned father, Joe Biden, whose ascent to the White...

On Thursday, 34 House Republicans and 15 Senate Republicans voted with Democrats to approve $6.4 billion in taxpayer money for the roughly 95,000 Afghans that Biden hopes to bring to the U.S. over the next 12 months — a population nine times larger than Jackson, Wyoming’s resident population.

__label__3 President Trump's Executive Orders on Prescription Drug PricingThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn July 24th, 2020, President Trump signed four executive orders that aim to lower prescription drug costs and ensure greater access to medications.According to a White House press release, "the first Order directs federally qualified health centers to pass along massive discounts on insulin and epinephrine received from drug companies to certain low-income Americans.""The second Order will allow State plans for safe importation of certain drugs, authorize the re-importation of insulin products made in the United States, and create a pathway for widespread use of personal importation waivers at authorized pharmacies in the United States.""The third Order will prohibit secret deals between drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit manager middlemen, ensuring patients directly benefit from available discounts at the pharmacy counter.""The fourth and final Order ensures that the United States pays the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for Medicare Part B drugs." (This fourth executive order is considered by many to be the most controversial.

Mitt Romney and 32 other GOP senators criticized the Democrats’ reconciliation bill Thursday for including “marriage penalties” in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Oregon Sen.

__label__3 Trump likely to sign executive orders on drug pricing FridayPresident Trump is likely to sign executive orders on Friday aimed at lowering drug prices, elevating a key issue for voters in an election year.  While the plans could shift at the last minute, some GOP lawmakers have been invited to a presidential event on drug pricing Friday at 3 p.m. at the White House in the South Court Auditorium to make the announcement, according to an invitation obtained by The Hill.  The exact details of the orders remain unclear, but sources say one order is likely to...
__label__1 Consulting giant McKinsey allegedly fed the opioid crisis. Now an affiliate may profit from treating addicts.McKinsey & Co., the global consulting giant, agreed to pay nearly $600 million last week to settle allegations by 49 states that its work for large opioid manufacturers helped "turbocharge" sales of the drugs, contributing to an addiction epidemic that rocked the country and has caused more than 400,000 deaths. The settlement is a black eye for the firm, which holds itself out as the preeminent global consultant advising corporations and governments. But because most of the money to be paid by McKinsey will go to state programs funding addiction...

Through her work with Republican Women for Progress, Hill-Davis, who lives in Washington, D.C., is hoping to reshape the party to appeal to a broader swath of people, including millennial women like herself. “Because I’m a moderate, I’m going to have to fight for space in the Republican...

__label__1 OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma pleads guilty to federal criminal chargesPurdue Pharma, the drugmaker blamed for helping to unleash America's staggering opioid crisis, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges as part of an $8 billion settlement over its marketing of OxyContin, the Department of Justice revealed Wednesday. The company agreed to pay the massive fines and admit criminal liability, but company executives and the Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma do not admit to any criminal wrongdoing in the agreement. However, the settlement does not shield them from potential criminal liability in the future. The company will pay $225...
__label__4 2020 Is Toxic for RepublicansOPINIONThe best indication that Larry Elder was going down hard in the California recall wasn’t the polling, although that all swung the wrong way in the final weeks, but his suggestion late in the campaign that Democrats were going to steal the election. Preemptive excuse-making isn’t a sign of great confidence — the winning side never complains of cheating. Sure enough, incumbent governor Gavin Newsom cruised to a victory made a little easier, as it happens, by Elder’s insistence that Republicans were robbed in 2020 and about to be robbed again. To his...
__label__3 Why most Covid-19 deaths won’t be from the virusIt all began with a large hollow tree. Two-year-old Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree, which was near his home in Meliandou – a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle. But other life had also discovered its cosy confines: bats. Children would sometimes catch them there, before roasting them for dinner. Then Emile got sick. On the 28 December 2013, he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness. His mother, sister and grandmother were next. And that was it – after the funeral, the...
__label__1 How a Pharma Giant Flooded the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation With OpioidsIt was easy for Jana Wolf Necklace to get painkillers on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. She developed an opioid addiction while working at her dad’s bar in Fort Yates, the main town on the North Dakota side of the tribe’s land. Eventually, she started trading alcohol to customers for pills they obtained from the reservation’s federally-run Indian Health Services pharmacy. “There was all kinds — whatever you wanted was around here, and a lot of it,” Wolf Necklace, 43, recalled. “People would come and they would have big bottles....
__label__5 The Billionaires’ PartyOPINION"Toadies for billionaires” is how one excitable correspondent describes the Republican Party. But nobody seems to have told the billionaires. Politics is not based on policy, or economics, or analysis — politics is based on storytelling, and we typically are far more committed to our stories than to any other aspect of our political lives. (Oh, no, not you! You’re an enlightened philosopher-king. But that other guy. . . .) We stick with our stories even when the facts on the ground have changed.

__label__3 How The Coronavirus Pandemic Could Impact The Opioid CrisisA few weeks ago, Dr. Joseph Mega was making the rounds with Contra Costa County’s mobile street medicine team. The team parked behind a department store in the far east side of the county. About 30 tents were lined up along a fence in a field. Soon people poured into the parking lot.  The team handed out clean needles and Narcan, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. He prescribed one person buprenorphine, a medication that can block cravings, ease the agonizing pain of withdrawal,...
__label__1 Opioid drug overdose deaths are down in US, study finds, but Covid-19 could change thatMore than 151,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, alcohol and suicide combined in 2018, slightly lower than the overall numbers in 2017, and leveling off for the first time in two decades, according to a new study. But the report also found that deaths of despair increased in some minority communities during the same time period. And separately alcohol-related deaths were up 4% and suicides were up 2%, the analysis by the non-profit health policy groups Trust for America's Health and the Well Being Trust, reported Thursday. While the numbers...
__label__4 Voters Are Done With COVID-19 and Pandemic-Powered OfficialsANALYSISPoliticians have been on a high over the last year-plus, wielding extraordinary power with the approval of voters fearful of viral infection. Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...
__label__3 21 States Reject $18 Billion Offer From Drug Wholesalers to Settle Opioid LitigationAn $18 billion offer from three major drug wholesalers aimed at settling litigation over their alleged role in the opioid crisis fell through, after more than 20 state attorneys general rejected it in a letter to the companies’ law firms this week. The letter, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, shows that the drug industry hasn’t won enough support from states to begin moving the sprawling litigation to a global resolution. At least 30 states have either sued the distributors or have been involved in talks to resolve claims. Whether...
__label__1 How Quarantine Can Trigger Relapse for People in RecoveryIsolation. Anxiety. Cravings. Not seeing friends. Worrying about an invisible and deadly disease. Depriving oneself of immediate gratification. Surrendering to the sheer magnitude of the situation. For many, this is a new post-COVID routine. For people with addictions in recovery, it’s a daily checklist that existed long before this global health crisis did. Isolation can trigger enough introspection to cut through the carefully placed layers of internal bullshit that allow chaos and addiction to fester, but it can also trigger a relapse, especially when financial and mental health hang in...
__label__4 Here Are The Conservatives Suing Biden Over His ‘Unconstitutional’ Vaccine CoercionANALYSISAt least 19 states have already begun to legally pursue action against the Biden administration for forcing medical coercion on federal contractors but following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s new emergency temporary standard demanding employers with 100 or more workers mandate the jab, others are looking to sue too. OSHA’s explicit threat that the rule could eventually extend to smaller businesses in the near future has also pushed politicians, attorneys, and business owners to take legal action. Here are the conservatives who are suing Biden and his administration for forcing the COVID-19 jab...
__label__3 Drug price hikes are back for 2020Pharmaceutical manufacturers have raised the sticker prices on hundreds of drugs at the start of 2020, with most of the increases coming under 10%. The big picture: It may be a new year, but the same drugs are once again subject to the same industry practices. Between the lines: Political pressure has forced some drugmakers to consider fewer price hikes on their medicines or to keep the increases in single-digit percentages. Raising prices doesn't necessarily mean net drug spending (after rebates and other discounts given to health insurers) goes up...
__label__1 Good News: The Federal Government Just Made It a Whole Lot Easier to Access Opioid Addiction TreatmentFor the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have to visit clinics for daily doses of opioid addiction medication, social distancing is nearly impossible. But on Tuesday, the federal government eased some of its long-held restrictions in response to the coronavirus. That’s good news, because continual access to two primary treatment medications, buprenorphine and methadone, is key: If patients miss a dose, they could go into withdrawal and turn to street drugs, risking overdose. Those struggling with addiction are particularly vulnerable in the age of coronavirus for a host of...
__label__4 19 States Sue Biden Administration Over COVID-19 Vaccine MandateSeveral U.S. states on Friday mounted multiple federal lawsuits against the Biden administration over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors. Texas sued individually in a federal court in Galveston. Another lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Missouri involves Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Yet another lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Georgia, involves Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia. The lawsuits come a day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he sued the administration over the same vaccine mandate. As of late Friday, the total number of...

__label__2 40 Americans Are Dying Every Month From Taking this New, Legal OpioidA new, legal synthetic opioid as deadly as fentanyl has been implicated in scores of deaths in the U.S. The appearance of isotonitazene in North America’s narcotic food chain seems to confirm fears that last year’s ban by China of the non-medical use, supply, and production of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl would fail to shut the door on the lab drugs fueling America’s opioid crisis. Barry K. Logan, a leading international authority on forensic toxicology and chief scientist at forensic firm NMS labs, said his colleagues have identified isotonitazene—which...

Thus far, China has administered more than 2.2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines—almost three times more than India, the country that has doled out the second most Covid jabs. More than 70 percent of China’s 1.4 billion population is fully vaccinated. China’s two most widely used Covid-19 vaccines, the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, were approved for use in children from ages three to 17 over the summer; however, China has been somewhat hesitant to vaccinate children...
__label__3 U.S. Supreme Court rejects Arizona opioid case against Purdue, Sackler familyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a novel case by Arizona seeking to recover billions of dollars that the state has said that members of the Sackler family - owners of Purdue Pharma LP - funneled out of the OxyContin maker before the company filed for bankruptcy in September. The justices declined to take the rare step of allowing Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich to pursue a case directly with the Supreme Court on the role the drugmaker played in the U.S. opioid epidemic that...
__label__2 How Working-Class Life Is Killing Americans, in ChartsOPINIONWhen the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton first published their research on “deaths of despair” five years ago, they focused on middle-aged whites. So many white working-class Americans in their 40s and 50s were dying of suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse that the overall mortality rate for the age group was no longer falling – a rare and shocking pattern in a modern society. But as Case and Deaton continued digging into the data, it became clear that the grim trends didn’t apply only to middle-aged whites. Up and...

People who want to eat dinner in a restaurant, see a movie, get their hair styled, or spend any significant amount of time inside an indoor business will be required to provide documentation that they've been vaccinated. You'd think that Los Angeles taking such drastic measures is an indicator that there's a struggle here to get people vaccinated or that the city and...
__label__3 Oklahoma judge reduces Johnson & Johnson payout in opioid case to $465 million(Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Friday said Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) only needs to pay $465 million of the $572 million he previously concluded it owed the state for fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive painkiller marketing.The ruling by Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma, came in the first case to go to trial out of 2,700 nationally by states, counties and cities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the deadly epidemic.
__label__1 Oklahoma files suit against three major opioid distributorsThe state of Oklahoma, which last year won a court verdict against opioid manufacturer Johnson & Johnson, filed suit Monday against three mammoth drug distributors, accusing them of contributing to the drug crisis by indiscriminately sending billions of painkillers across the country. Oklahoma State Attorney General Mike Hunter (R) said the three companies — McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen — delivered more than 34 billion doses of narcotics to Oklahoma and the rest of the United States between 2006 and 2012, failing to halt plainly suspicious drug orders because...

Now in his late 20s, the English-as-a-second language teacher has gone through about 15 more surgeries of varying severity.With each operation came new painkillers. At 14, while living in New England, Le Blanc started buying and using illegal opioids for fun. By 16, he was injecting heroin, a habit that he carried from high school through college graduation.
__label__1 Major drugstore chains sue doctors in sprawling federal opioid caseMajor drugstore chains — which face an October trial in the mammoth federal opioid litigation — have sued doctors across northeast Ohio, claiming that physicians are the real culprits in the nation’s deadly drug epidemic. CVS, Walgreen Co., Walmart, Rite Aid and other major pharmacy chains said opioid prescribers bear responsibility for the prescription narcotic crisis, but unlike the drugstores, have not been sued by Cuyahoga and Summit counties. In legal papers filed Monday, they contended that doctors and other prescribers should have to pay some of the penalty if...
__label__4 How Will Courts React to Biden’s Increasingly Imperial Presidency?OPINIONThe history of the United States, insofar as concerns the vitality of civil rights in times of crisis, can be summed up succinctly. While a crisis ensues, when there is a real perception of threat to our security, the courts give the executive a wide berth. They don’t exactly turn a blind eye. It’s more like slow-walking. Cases claiming infringement of fundamental liberties may be rushed into the justice system during a crisis, but courts will proceed cautiously. Sometimes they’ll wait to issue rulings until the security threat has passed. In the...

Two years earlier, he had sent American troops across the Pacific to defend South Korea against a communist invasion from the North. He did so without a formal declaration of war or any other authorization from Congress. This might pose a constitutional problem, but Truman had a concrete problem as well. Thousands of American soldiers, on his watch, were fighting a bloody overseas war. To win, they needed tanks, guns and other weaponry. And to procure such armaments, Truman needed steel.

After the call, McLoone told his family that he had to go, and left, embarrassed. Over the next few days, he would...

The White House is relying on the regulatory authority of the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency dating back to 1971, and in particular its seldom-used emergency powers. Some backers of Biden's action seem to think waving in OSHA's general direction,...
__label__3 Purdue Pharma reaches tentative opioids settlementPurdue Pharma has tentatively reached the first "global" settlement in the nationwide opioids lawsuit, the New York Times and AP report. The plaintiffs later confirmed this to Axios. The big picture: The deal would reportedly result in the maker of OxyContin entering bankruptcy and the Sackler family owners paying $3 billion over 7 years, among other terms. Some states still aren't on board with the proposal and may pursue Purdue and the Sacklers further, NYT reports. But the first major deal appears imminent ahead of the scheduled October trial.
__label__2 Purdue Pharma’s Payments to Sacklers Soared Amid Opioid CrisisAs scrutiny of Purdue Pharma’s role in the opioid epidemic intensified during the past dozen years, its owners, members of the Sackler family, withdrew more than $10 billion from the company, distributing it among trusts and overseas holding companies, according to a new audit commissioned by Purdue. The amount is more than eight times what the family took out of the company in the 13 years after OxyContin, its signature product, was approved in 1995. The audit is likely to renew questions about how much the Sacklers should pay to...
__label__4 Biden, Dems Want To Monitor Americans’ Bank Accounts, Blasted As Violating 4th AmendmentPresident Biden and the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget plan means to monitor gross inflows and outflows from Americans’ bank accounts, prompting concern that the federal government would be willfully violating the 14thAmendment. “The proposal would require banks to report to gross inflows and outflows to the IRS, including transactions from Venmo, PayPal, crypto exchanges and the like in an effort to fight tax evasion,” The Daily Mail noted, adding, “The IRS would know how much money is in an individual’s bank account in a given year, whether the individual earned income on...

Yet these jobs may also expose hard-hats to another risk: substance abuse. A recent study found that workers in these industries are more likely than other workers to use opioids and cocaine. A little over 3% of those employed in the construction trade and extraction industry had used non-prescription opioids over the past month, compared to 2% of other types of workers, according to the research, which was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published...

Why it matters: The fight threatens to reopen a fault line within the party that could cost Omar her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, writes Punchbowl News. The House previously passed a resolution by Democrats condemning anti-Semitism in response to comments on Israel by Omar, and Republicans have long accused the Minnesota congresswoman...

The deal is with the “Big Three” distributors McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and Teva Pharmaceuticals, the Israeli-based manufacturer of generic opioids. The agreement does not include a fifth defendant, Walgreens, the retail drugstore chain that was sued over its own distribution operation. Walgreens’ case was postponed. A sixth...

The ruling didn't hold long—the judge himself quickly reversed course—but the initial decision will be chilling for thousands of parents across the country. Making parental or child vaccination a requirement for custody would be an enormous judicial and government overreach, setting a dangerous precedent for intervention into what has traditionally been the realm of the family. This case...

Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest manufacturer of generic drugs in the world, and three drug distributors, among the biggest corporations in America, have agreed to pay a total of $260m to settle lawsuits by two Ohio counties. The trial was intended as the first of a series designed to establish whether opioid makers,...

City police and the Louisiana National Guard will be enforcing the curfew. The police chief said numerous arrests have already been made for looting, but denied the city is out of control. Meanwhile, residents in New Orleans have been without power since Sunday with city...
__label__3 Gaza faces food and medicine shortages without ceasefire: UN officialShortages of food, water, fuel and medicine are growing more dire in Gaza, and further fighting will make them dramatically worse, Matthias Schmale, the Gaza director for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) told Axios in a Zoom interview on Tuesday evening. The state of play: The most urgent problem is the displacement of Palestinians, including the around 50,000 who left their homes near the border with Israel, fearing a ground invasion, and are now taking shelter in 60 UNRWA schools. “Parents here are mainly worried for the security...
__label__1 America's First Safe Legal Injection Site for Heroin Just Got a Step Closer to RealityA Philadelphia nonprofit’s plan to open a safe injection site doesn’t violate federal drug laws, a judge ruled today, bringing the country’s first site for medically supervised heroin consumption one step closer to reality.The Justice Department had argued that the proposed site, called Safehouse, would violate a decades-old law known as the “crackhouse statute.” But Judge Gerald Austin McHugh ruled Wednesday that Safehouse intends to “reduce drug use, not facilitate it.”
__label__4 Families Are Fleeing Government-Run SchoolsANALYSISThis fall may be the biggest moment of truth for public education since the 1970s. After seeing enrollment in government-run K-12 schools decline by 3 percent in COVID-marred 2020–21 (including 13 percent for kindergarten and pre-K), all while homeschooling tripled, the $122 billion question facing this new school year is whether that defection is an aberration or inflection point. Given the amount of time that families have now had to plan around school-opening policies that have been among the most cautious in the developed world, would they choose their neighborhood school, or seek alternative solutions...
__label__3 Are Israel, Hamas committing war crimes in Gaza?More than a week into their fourth war, Israel and the Hamas militant group already face allegations of possible war crimes in Gaza. Israel says Hamas is using Palestinian civilians as human shields, while critics say Israel is using disproportionate force. Who’s right? It’s hard to say, especially in the fog of battle. The firing of hundreds of imprecise rockets into Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian groups is fairly clear-cut. International law prohibits targeting civilians or using indiscriminate force in civilian areas. Rockets slamming into Tel Aviv apartment blocks...

The deal with Cuyahoga and Summit counties comes a little more than a month after an Oklahoma judge ordered the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based health care conglomerate to pay $572m over its marketing of opioids in that state. It was announced less than three weeks before...

The seizure opens the door for government to go forward with the technological tracking of U.S. citizens. How so? It strengthens the arguments of pro-vaccine passport types who say Americans must be vaccinated, or else risk infecting the innocent; that Americans must prove vaccination as conditions of associating freely in public and interacting with others; that vaccine passports are obviously the easiest means by which proof of...

What does the goal of “honest broker” mean today? As the deadly exchanges of rocket fire and airstrikes between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered their second week Monday, the White House issued a statement in which for the first time President Joe Biden expressed his support for a “cease-fire” in the hostilities. But as if to rule out any doubts about where Mr. Biden...

The money has gone to Democrats and Republicans, party leaders and back-benchers, freshmen members and long-time incumbents. Two Oklahoma lawmakers—Sen. James Lankford and Rep. Markwayne Mullin, both Republicans—accepted donations from the company, despite the enormous publicity the trial generated in their state. So far, none of the lawmakers has announced plans...

__label__2 Biden Can’t Claim ‘Moral Leadership’ While Sanctioning the ICCOPINIONIn his Feb. 4 foreign-policy address, U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to make human rights and multilateralism cornerstones of his approach to global affairs. But that’s a pledge he appears to have forgotten just a day later, on Feb. 5, when the pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has the authority to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the West Bank and Gaza Strip—by Israeli and Palestinian personnel alike. Biden’s State Department immediately criticized the court’s scrutiny of...

The UAE's agreement to the accords was first announced in mid-August.Functionally, the accords allow for the establishment of embassies as well as economic and political cooperation.

Palestinian protests, in support of their kin, erupted on both sides of the Green Line that separates the occupied Palestinian territories from internationally recognized Israeli territory. In Israel’s “mixed” cities, clashes between Palestinian and Jewish citizens intensified, exposing existing internal fault lines. Mob violence and rioting spread to places like Lod, Haifa, and Yafa.

For Palestinians, the UAE-Israel agreement looms as more than just a blow to Arab unity and their quest for statehood, but as a reckoning for their leadership and a final nail in the coffin of the Oslo peace process. Feeling alienated by Arab allies, the United States, and the...
__label__2 U.S. tech giants’ vise over Israel tightens despite ceasefireThe aftermath of this month’s violence in the Gaza Strip is deepening the pressure on Google, Amazon and Facebook to reexamine their close ties to Israel — an effort that comes amid a broader reckoning over the militarization of the U.S. tech industry. Tech employees who previously pressured the corporate behemoths into dropping projects with the Pentagon and China are strategizing with outside activists over the best way to agitate against cloud contracts with the Israeli government. They’re considering a range of options, including cajoling shareholders and circulating letters to...
__label__4 Taxes Separate Dying Illinois From Thriving MissouriANALYSISOn the I-57 highway through Illinois, time seems to go backward with each southbound mile. The houses and cars in the yards get older. As years pass, town populations shrink. Eventually, homes turn back into piles of disconnected wood and glass, then empty lots. At the end of the highway, the town of Cairo slowly sinks back into the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. A town of 15,000 people in the 1920s, Cairo now houses fewer than 2,000 residents. Today, the town is so silent that the few voices heard while...
__label__3 In Trump plan, Arab Israelis see assault on their identityIt’s called “the Triangle” – a cluster of Arab towns and villages nestled along a valley and on the slopes of adjacent hills in north-central Israel, across the border from the northern West Bank. President Donald Trump’s new Middle East peace deal suggests the borders be redrawn so the 300,000 Arab citizens of Israel who live in the Triangle, a fifth of the country’s Arab minority, become part of a future Palestinian state. The swift and furious answer to that proposal from those who live there, one that cuts to...

Last week, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in a conflict that claimed nearly 250 lives. But the underlying status quo makes another round of fighting all but inevitable, and a fundamental solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems further away than ever. Worse, the long-running American solution for the problem — a US-mediated peace process aimed at creating a “two-state solution,” with an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside...

__label__3 President Trump's Middle East Peace PlanThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSOn Tuesday, January 28th, U.S. President Trump and Israeli PM Netanyahu announced a new 181-page plan for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan, titled "Peace to Prosperity," can be easily found on the home page of whitehouse.gov.While the plan provides for Palestinian statehood, it would not allow it full autonomy. Israel would "maintain overriding security responsibility for the State of Palestine," with "the aspirations that the Palestinians will be responsible for as much of their internal security as possible."The plan allows Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, considered illegal under international law, to become Israeli territory, along with large portions of the West Bank.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, was a key architect in the plan, which was hailed as the culmination of three years of negotiations.

Thousands of Palestinians heeded the call for a national strike in Israel, and there were new confrontations as Palestinians joined protests at flashpoints on a "day of rage" to vent anger over the deadly strikes on Gaza.

The plan envisages a Palestinian state and the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over West Bank settlements.

__label__4 It’s Time to Make the House BiggerOPINIONGeorge Washington had an uncanny knack for getting things right at the last minute. As general of the Continental Army, Washington defused a conspiracy within his officer corps to revolt at the tail end of the Revolutionary War in the spring of 1783. Such a military revolt could have snuffed out American democracy in its infancy. In his old age, Washington, who had owned slaves since he was a young boy, ensured that all of his slaves would be freed upon his wife Martha’s death through his will.

Unfortunately, our political culture is dominated by a collection of incompetents and imbeciles for which nothing can pass without screw-ups and unnecessary outrage. Juneteenth—long celebrated in parts of America's black culture on June 19 but increasingly crossing over in the mainstream, as Reason's Zuri Davis detailed—marks the day in 1865 that the Union Army marched into Galveston, Texas, and freed roughly 250,000 slaves. Over the years, it has become a celebration of the snuffing out of chattel slavery within...
__label__2 Trump's Executive Order on Combating Anti-SemitismThis Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSPresident Trump signed an executive order Wednesday afternoon which specifies that Jews on college campuses are protected under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when cases of discrimination are "based on an individual's race, color, or national origin."Anti-semitic incidents have risen sharply in recent years, particularly on college campuses. Incidents have ranged from harassment to physical violence, including the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018.On Tuesday, the New York Times reported incorrectly that the order would redefine Judaism as a nationality rather than a religion, stirring controversy among the Jewish community. However, it was later uncovered that the text of the order uses no such language.While the text of the order was less controversial than originally reported (and was, in fact, based on Obama administration guidance from 2010), a key point in the surviving debate has been the Trump administration's attempt to tie the recent rise in anti-semitism to criticism of Israel, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement specifically.You can read the full text of the order on whitehouse.gov.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from Critical of the Order to Supportive of the OrderPresident Trump Is Defending Jewish StudentsPresident Trump's executive order on anti-Semitism does not make me feel saferPresident Trump’s executive order won’t redefine Judaism, but will complicate rising anti-SemitismTrump order to fight anti-Semitism at colleges shows he strongly supports Jews and Israel

It's a given in American politics that partisans become born-again believers in federalism when their faction is out of power in Washington, D.C., only to lose faith in decentralization the next time they win control of Congress and the presidency. Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it's refreshing to see in this deeply divided country at least tentative steps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issue should be settled by...

If special counsel John Durham has cracked the core of the Russiagate case, if he has established that the Steele dossier on which the FBI substantially based its spy warrants was fraudulent, does that mean he is nearing a sweeping conspiracy indictment? Will there be criminal charges that target the real 2016 collusion — not between the Trump campaign and Russia, but between the Clinton campaign and U.S. officials who abused government investigative powers for political purposes? Almost certainly not. All signs are that Durham will end...

__label__5 Was It Putin Spying on Ronald Reagan in '88 Moscow Photo?A 1998 photo of former President Ronald Reagan's visit to Moscow appears to show a young Vladimir Putin posing as a tourist, leading the photographer to speculate the former KGB agent was spying on the U.S. president. The photo has been discussed for a few years, but White House photographer Pete Souza resurfaced it this week as President Joe Biden takes his first meeting with the Russian president. Souza, who was the White House photographer during the Reagan and Obama administrations, posted the photo on Instagram on Wednesday: "A Putin mystery. Or...

__label__3 How to feed the world in the next crisisANALYSISWith queues at food banks, produce rotting unpicked in fields and empty supermarket shelves, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown both that too many people live below the breadline around the world and our food networks are stressed to their limits. Last year was incredibly difficult for those working in the food industry. But, where there is uncertainty there are also opportunities, and the pandemic has encouraged many of us to take stock of what we do. If we could reimagine our global food system, is there a way to make...
__label__2 Palestinian Leaders See Validation of Their Statehood EffortUnder most circumstances, an Israeli leader’s frank admission that he would never agree to a Palestinian state would be a disaster for the Palestinian leadership. But when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said precisely that in the heat of the recent election campaign, it seemed to have the opposite effect, validating the unilateral approach the Palestinians have decided to follow.
__label__4 Putin Says Russia Would Accept Conditional Handover Of Cyber Criminals To U.S.President Vladimir Putin has said Russia would be ready to hand over cyber criminals to the United States if Washington did the same for Moscow and the two powers reached an agreement to that effect. Putin made the comments in an interview aired in excerpts on state television on Sunday ahead of a June 16 summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in Geneva. Ties between the powers are badly strained over an array of issues. The Russian leader said he expected the Geneva meeting to help establish bilateral dialogue and...
__label__3 Can We Save the Planet, Live Comfortably, and Have Children Too?OPINIONThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought about what Zillow calls “the great re-shuffling,” as more people head out of major metropolitan areas to work, often remotely, in less dense, even rural areas. The recent surges in urban crime and disorder, in once-placid London and Paris, and once-triumphant New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, are likely to make things even tougher for the urban core.

__label__3 Environmental groups sue in bid to block EPA 'secret science' ruleGreen groups on Monday filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent a new rule limiting the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) use of certain studies from taking effect. The lawsuit takes aim at the EPA’s Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science rule, also known as the "secret science" rule, which restricts the use of studies that don’t make their underlying data public.  The agency has billed the rule as a transparency measure, though its opponents argue that it will prevent consideration of important public health studies that can’t publish their...
__label__2 Israel Blocks Access to Contested Holy Site in JerusalemThe Israeli authorities closed off all access to a contested holy site in the Old City here on Thursday for the first time in years, a step that a Palestinian spokesman denounced as amounting to “a declaration of war.” The action came after Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man who was suspected of involvement in an attempt on Wednesday to assassinate a leading agitator for more Jewish access to the site, which Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. The closing prevented Muslims from...
__label__4 Biden: ‘No evidence’ Russia hacked Colonial Pipeline, but Putin needs to actPresident Biden on Monday said there’s “no evidence” that the Russian government is behind the Colonial Pipeline ransomware hack, but that it has a responsibility to respond because the suspected perpetrators are Russian. Biden noted in his first remarks on the devastating oil pipeline hack that he plans to meet next month with Russian President Vladimir Putin in his first overseas trip. “I’m gonna have a conver — I’m going to be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that...

Mr. Xi’s announcement came after pressure from European leaders and signaled a significant turnaround from Beijing’s long resistance to restrictions on economic growth. Whether China will reach its target remains uncertain. Yet experts say the pledge marks a major step in the world’s campaign to arrest climate change.

__label__4 'Unprovoked escalation': U.S. slams Russian military's partial blockade of Black SeaTop U.S. officials late Monday slammed Russia‘s “unprovoked escalation” in the Black Sea, saying Moscow‘s plan to blockade parts of the sea during military exercises is unacceptable and further evidence of Russia‘s intent to undermine neighboring Ukraine. State Department spokesman Ned Price’s condemnation of the Kremlin comes amid a massive buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and underscores fears in Washington that Russia may be laying the groundwork for a major military offensive. “The United States expresses its deep concern over Russia’s plans to block foreign naval ships...
__label__3 Build the Safety Net Back Better -- Put States in ChargeOPINIONSay what you will about 2020, but it’s undoubtedly a time of reinvention. As an election collides with a pandemic, protests, and riots, it would be easy to summarize it all as chaos. But any keen observer -- or “Game of Thrones” fan knows -- chaos isn’t always a pit. Sometimes, it’s a ladder. So, the question is: Which decaying institutions or dead ideas should we discard, and which should we reinvigorate? America’s welfare state jumps off the page. The pandemic has revealed just how rigid and costly our complex...
__label__1 Hamas and Israel Agree to Extended Gaza Cease-FireIsrael and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday reached a long-term cease-fire after seven weeks of fighting, according to officials on both sides, halting the longest, bloodiest battle either side has experienced in years — but without resolving many of the bigger issues underlying the conflict.“Israel has once again accepted an Egyptian proposal for a complete cease-fire,” a senior Israeli official said on the condition of anonymity. “This cease-fire is unlimited in time.”
__label__4 Russian Bounties: Fake News after AllOPINIONWell, well, well. Just hours after Joe Biden finally announced his big decision on Afghanistan, and minutes before sanctions on Russia were updated, news outlets are reporting that U.S. intel has low confidence in the story that Russia was paying for bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. You may remember the Russian bounties story from not one, but two successive New York Times election-year exclusives. It held that United States intelligence officials “have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces...
__label__3 The West’s Constitutional Crises Threaten the Economy’s Last Best HopeANALYSISIn the looking-glass moment of November 2020 we should perhaps no longer be surprised to see the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, demanding more fiscal action to address the coronavirus crisis. But one does have to pinch oneself. Did we ever dream that we would see the central bank guardians of price stability taking on the role of lead cheerleaders for massive fiscal activism?
__label__2 How Republicans used Senate delays to make changes at U.S. product safety regulator. Critics call it a ‘power grab’ that puts public at risk.A short-lived Republican majority atop the nation’s product safety regulator — the result of Senate delays in confirming Democratic nominees — recently pushed through dozens of last-minute changes to the agency’s annual plan, slowing work on some safety rules and abandoning at least one enforcement effort altogether. The changes mean the Consumer Product Safety Commission no longer plans in the coming year to draw up new mandatory rules for preventing suffocation in infant nursing pillows or carbon monoxide poisoning from gas appliances. The amended plan also canceled a pilot project...
__label__4 Rubio: Biden Order on Russia a 'Legality' to Allow Action on SolarWindsPresident Joe Biden's executive order against "the full scope of Russia's harmful foreign activities" was not a true statement, but was a "technicality" or a "legality" that will give him the emergency powers to take action on the SolarWinds hacking into U.S. government and corporate computer systems, Sen. Marco Rubio said Thursday.  "I'm pretty certain the reason you do an executive order, or you issue that emergency declaration is it now opens up extraordinary powers on the executive branch to take specified action that might not otherwise be there,"...
__label__3 Bracing for protests over racial justice and “stand your ground”ANALYSISAmerica is bracing for a sequel to the protests ignited after George Floyd's murder, with the focus now less on police and more on the nation's broader criminal justice system and self-defense laws.  Why it matters: Activists and law enforcement officials warn that two ongoing national trials have the ingredients to reignite racial tensions and public protests when verdicts are handed down. Driving the news: In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with fatally shooting two men and injuring another during protests against police last summer. In the other case, three white...

The 18-wheelers carrying logs rumble by less than 100 feet from his house, all day and night, shaking it as if an earthquake has taken over this tranquil corner of North Carolina. He’s been wearing masks since long before the coronavirus pandemic, just to keep the dust out of his lungs. Some nights, he only sleeps...
__label__5 Putin closes off access to Black Sea after Biden’s about-face on UkraineRussian President Vladimir Putin took advantage of the Biden administration’s decision to abandon plans to send two destroyers to the Black Sea by closing off the Kerch Strait, connecting Crimea to Russia, to foreign warships until next fall. The action comes as Russia warned the US on Tuesday to stay away from the area “for their own good” after the Biden administration said it was going to send two destroyers — the USS Roosevelt and the USS Donald Cook — to the Black Sea in response to Moscow’s increasing military...
__label__3 Florida GOP limits vaccine mandates, flouting White HouseFlorida Republicans approved a sweeping bill Wednesday to hobble coronavirus vaccine mandates in businesses, rejecting claims that they were sacrificing public health to hand Gov. Ron DeSantis a win in his fight against White House virus rules. Lawmakers in GOP-controlled statehouse expedited the measure, along with a package of virus bills, after hours of debate in which Republicans maintained they were protecting workers from onerous mandates by the federal government. “If you want to get a vaccine, you can get a vaccine.

Sonne, 31, founder of marketing startup Decibel, was working remotely from rural South Dakota when the pandemic hit. After a few months of lockdown, the Sonnes found that being cooped up at home in a small town wasn't working, so they put their belongings in storage and started traveling. They began in Utah, in Provo and then Salt Lake City, and...

__label__3 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...

These products were not regulated like cradles and bassinets.  Before it was voluntarily recalled in 2019, 4.7 million Rock 'n Plays were sold.

__label__2 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...

Chick-fil-A has been assuring customers for nearly a decade that it has stopped donating to anti-LGBTQ causes, only to be caught doing so time and again.

A lecture by a physicist was canceled at one of America’s premier institutions of science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for reasons having nothing to do with the subject of the lecture. The lecture was canceled not because of its scientific content but because of the politically incorrect views on diversity of the scientist scheduled to give the lecture. Dorian Abbot is a professor in the department of the geophysical sciences at the...

With most items on their agenda hobbled by the Senate filibuster, top House Democrats are eyeing ways to muscle through drug pricing and climate policy goals using the same arcane budget process that let the party bypass GOP votes for its pandemic aid bill. Sweeping immigration bills are also on the wishlist for many members, with Democrats eager to fit what they can in...
__label__4 Leaked Grant Proposal Confirms Chinese and American Scientists Planned to Create Novel CoronavirusA World Health Organization (WHO) collaborator, who reviewed a coronavirus research grant application unearthed last month, confirmed that the language of the documents suggests American and Chinese scientists planned to collaborate on the creation of a new coronavirus not found in nature. The grant proposal, obtained by the analysis group DRASTIC last month, was submitted to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2018 by the EcoHealth Alliance, an American research non-profit that planned to collaborate with Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology to create a...
__label__3 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...

Biden asked the intelligence community in May to further investigate whether COVID-19 came about ” from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident.” The request followed an original report from the intelligence community that “coalesced around two likely scenarios” but did not come to a conclusion on how the global pandemic came to be. Portions of the classified report are expected...
__label__3 Media coverage of Tuesday’s election focuses on the dire state of DemocratsANALYSISDoomsday for Democrats; a rebirth for Republicans. That’s, basically, the media’s take on Tuesday’s Election Day. And that take was essentially based on two results. First, and most of all, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor of Virginia — a state Joe Biden handily won against Donald Trump in 2020. And, second, the way-tighter-than-expected race between New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. But it’s Virginia that has the Democrats reeling. During CBS News’ coverage, chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said, “If...
__label__2 Top 1% fails to report over 20% of income using potentially "criminal" tacticsANALYSISThe wealthiest 1% of Americans fail to report more than 20% of their income to the IRS, and some of those ultra-rich people use "sophisticated evasion technologies" and criminal tactics to avoid paying their full share, according to a new analysis by researchers at the IRS and economists. The analysis estimated that the top 1% of households fail to report 21% of their income. Nearly a third of that is through sophisticated schemes that random IRS audits fail to detect. The trend is even starker among the top 0.1% of...
__label__4 American Medical Association Faces Backlash for Calling to Remove Sex From Birth CertificatesThe American Medical Association (AMA), the largest organization of physicians and medical students in the United States, came under fire over the weekend for a recent proposal calling to end the designation of sex on birth certificates.

The study found that vaccinated subjects had nearly the same amount of virus in their bodies as the unvaccinated, suggesting they were as likely to transmit the virus to others. Still, the authors included major caveats in the study, most notably that it only included subjects who happened...

Across the world, millions of lives could be saved if countries raise ambitions on cutting emissions to limit global heating to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, as they have committed to in the global Paris climate accord. The researchers said the findings highlighted the added incentive of improvements to human health from tackling climate change. Research from the Lancet...

__label__2 The Terrifying Warning Lurking in the Earth’s Ancient Rock RecordOPINIONWe live on a wild planet, a wobbly, erupting, ocean-sloshed orb that careens around a giant thermonuclear explosion in the void. Big rocks whiz by overhead, and here on the Earth’s surface, whole continents crash together, rip apart, and occasionally turn inside out, killing nearly everything. Our planet is fickle. When the unseen tug of celestial bodies points Earth toward a new North Star, for instance, the shift in sunlight can dry up the Sahara, or fill it with hippopotamuses. Of more immediate interest today, a variation in the composition...
__label__4 Ivermectin Shows Us the Consequences of Politicized ScienceANALYSISA contingent of Americans has embraced the anti-parasite drug ivermectin as a miracle cure for COVID-19 despite warnings from the American scientific community that little to no evidence exists of its efficacy. At the same time, many Americans have rejected the COVID-19 vaccines in spite of enormous evidence supporting their efficacy. The persistent trust in ivermectin and hesitancy to take a widely-proven vaccine is a logical consequence of rejecting American institutions, and a consequence exacerbated by those who have politicized science. How did ivermectin become the new hydroxychloroquine? Last November, Egyptian scientists published a...
__label__3 This study shows how people reason their way through echo chambers — and what might guide them outPreaching to the choir, shouting in an echo chamber — whatever your preferred metaphor is, a study published earlier this week in the Journal of the European Economic Association sheds some light on what may be happening when people are surrounded by others with like-minded views — and especially when they have a tough time gauging whether the information being presented within the chamber is accurate. The researchers behind the study, who are economists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducted an experiment among 220 college students. The underlying concept driving the...
__label__2 Why Biden's actions are good news from front lines of the climate change warOPINIONPresident Joe Biden, in his first weeks in office, already has advanced a sweeping agenda to tackle the climate crisis by addressing the health, economic, inequity and foreign policy aspects of the problem. An executive order he issued last week establishes climate as an essential consideration in U.S. foreign policy and national security, recognizing the importance of restoring our role as a leader in the international effort to avert catastrophic climate change. By labeling climate change a “maximum threat,” the president is signaling to the world that we’re in the...

And honestly, I want nothing more than to never give a single thought to this crisis...

__label__2 “The People We Serve Are Paying Too Much for Energy:” Virginia Lawmakers Are Targeting Dominion EnergyANALYSISIn a bid to lower some of the highest electricity bills in the nation, Virginia lawmakers are pushing legislation that would strengthen oversight of the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, potentially setting up hundreds of millions of dollars in customer refunds. The package of seven bills is designed to restore authority to Virginia’s State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities and other business interests. As the Richmond Times-Dispatch and ProPublica reported in October, years of Dominion-backed laws have left the agency hobbled as residential power bills have soared. Notably, the utility...

Rand Paul sparred Tuesday over claims that the Chinese lab where the COVID-19 virus is suspected to have emerged was doing “gain-of-function” research with funds provided by the National Institutes of Health.Beginning his questioning by reminding Fauci that lying to Congress is a felony, Paul quizzed the White House’s top medical adviser about his testimony from a May hearing in which Fauci denied the NIH-funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
__label__3 A look into the ugly and incredibly personal fight over Biden's pick to oversee banksANALYSISThe president's pick to become a top banking regulator doesn't usually attract a lot of interest, but this time is different. President Biden has nominated Saule Omarova, a law professor at Cornell University, to be the next head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is responsible for regulating the assets held by more than 1,000 banks. Progressive Democrats applauded that announcement, seeing in her a person who would bring a tougher approach to banks at an agency that has been criticized for being too friendly with...
__label__1 The Unfinished Business of Flint’s Water CrisisANALYSISWhen I first heard E. Yvonne Lewis tell the story, it was a hot July day in downtown Flint, Michigan. We and about 70 others had gathered in the high-ceilinged ballroom of the Northbank Center, just west of the river, where the Michigan Civil Rights Commission was conducting its 2016 hearings on how this Great Lakes city learned that its own water was a threat. Lewis, a community health worker and mother of three, testified that she kept a Crock-Pot in her bathroom. To take a bath, she filled the...
__label__5 Climate Change Crusade Not Based on Reputable ScienceOPINIONI was glad to see the article “BC Heat Wave Caused by Natural Climate Variability, Not Global Warming: Extreme Weather Expert,” published on July 7, about extreme weather citing former Environment Canada research scientist Dr. Madhav Khandekar. The climate scare is not based on reputable science or observational evidence about what is happening in the real world. Instead, it is founded merely on highly uncertain forecasts of hypothetical future climate states that are derived from computerized climate models that do not work. The primary outcome of the climate change crusade will not be enhanced...
__label__3 Revolutionary Change or Practical Help? Democrats Struggle With the DifferenceAre President Biden and his Democratic Party proposing sweeping, revolutionary change to the economy and the government’s social contract with Americans? Or are they offering practical help to citizens struggling to overcome longstanding problems as they recover from the economic shock of a pandemic? Some Democrats describe the former, others the latter. The difference may seem merely semantic, but in fact it has significant substantive effect: The split goes to the heart of a division within the Democratic Party that has plagued the effort to pass the Biden agenda, and to the...

They are among the millions of amateur traders collectively taking on some of Wall Street’s most sophisticated investors — and, for the moment at least, winning. Propelled by a mix of greed and boredom, gleefully determined to teach Wall Street a lesson, and turbocharged by an endless flow of get-rich-quick hype and ideas delivered via social media, these...

The Vax-A-Million incentive program started in May and has already awarded vaccinated applicants lucky enough to have their names pulled from the list of eligible candidates. Ohioans ages 12 to 17 who received one or more doses had the chance to win one of five scholarship awards, and anyone over 18 with the same qualifications is eligible for one of five $1 million...
__label__3 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...
__label__1 The US is back in the international climate gameANALYSISAs soon as he arrived in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden made his first move to fulfill a promise to prioritize climate change by signing sweeping executive orders covering an array of policies and committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the most immediate steps is rejoining the Paris agreement, the nonbinding international pact signed in 2015 to prevent the most severe consequences of climate change. By reentering the agreement, Biden is recommitting the US to drastically reducing emissions in order to limit average global temperature rise...

As Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man on the planet, readies to launch himself into space aboard one of his own rockets, the world is watching the birth of a new dawn in space. Previously, America relied on its government agency, NASA, to propel it to the cosmos during the last space race with the Soviet Union. Today, America’s greatest hopes are with its private sector. Jeff Bezos is not engaging in such risky behavior simply because he’s an adrenaline...

Congress is set to take a weeklong recess and return on Nov. 15 with a litany of items to complete in short order to avert a government shutdown and move forward on the roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package that has proven difficult to negotiate with the party’s slim majority in...

Andrew Cuomo has gone down fighting, using his farewell address to defiantly brand his treatment “unfair” and slam the attorney general’s report alleging he sexually harassed staffers as an orchestrated “political firecracker.” Cuomo started his address by declaring there would be another time to “talk about the truth” before launching into how he believed the handling of allegations leveled against him was “unjust.”     He also insisted that the “intense political pressure and media frenzy” surrounding the allegations had resulted in a “rush to judgment.” “When government politicizes allegations...
__label__3 A dispute over “Beloved” in the Virginia governor’s race is making Toni Morrison’s book a best sellerThe Virginia governor’s race waded into US culture wars this week when Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin seemed to take aim at Toni Morrison’s 1987 novel Beloved. On Oct. 25 Youngkin released an ad featuring a supporter named Laura Murphy, who tried to ban Beloved from her son’s school in a northwest suburb of Virginia in 2013, and later lobbied state lawmakers to pass a bill allowing parents to “opt out” their children from reading sexually explicit content in schools. Youngkin’s challenger, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, later vetoed the bill when he was serving a term as governor.

While many remember the four-star Army general for his history-making tenure as the nation's first Black secretary of state and his controversial and misleading justification for the U.S. war in Iraq, the longtime Republican's legacy also includes a notable break from his party to endorse Democrat Barack Obama in his first White House bid. That presidential race, in 2008, became one of the most politically and socially consequential contests in American history. Obama was the...

First, of course, were the horse-race polls showing Joe Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by nine or so percentage points. But there was also the money race, which Democrats were winning handily: Mr Biden’s campaign raised $952m, or nearly 60% more than Mr Trump’s campaign, described by reporters as a profligate operation limping cash-strapped into...

Andrew Cuomo. (How many journalists bothered to read the report before commenting, one wonders?) While press accounts have near-uniformly declared the allegations set forth to be supremely “damning,” a closer examination of the report itself, as well as the peculiar surrounding details, leaves room for a bit more ambiguity. The report concludes that “under the totality of the...

Biden lauded Cuomo, who leaves office in 14 days, despite the fact that Cuomo is under investigation by at least four New York district attorneys for assault and the fact that he’s under federal investigation for an admitted coverup of COVID-19 death data at New York nursing homes. “Well, he’s done a hell of a job.

Even Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who oversees impeachment proceedings but who has until now practically broken his back trying to protect the gov, admitted that Cuomo’s “conduct,” as outlined in James’ report, “would indicate someone who is not fit for office.” Heastie called the victims’ details...

__label__5 Biden finally says Cuomo should resign hours after blistering harassment reportPresident Biden on Tuesday called on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign after an official report found that he sexually harassed 11 women. “I think he should resign,” Biden said of his longtime political ally. Biden said in March that Cuomo should step down if a probe commissioned by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a fellow Democrat, concluded that the governor was guilty. ABC News host George Stephanopoulos asked Biden at the time, “If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign?”

Andrew Cuomo is the latest high-profile Democrat to have a career-threatening scandal to seemingly vanish from the mainstream media’s focus. Critics say it’s another example of widespread double standards and liberal bias plaguing America’s press.  "The media doesn’t cover the biggest stories, they cover the stories that further the points they previously made.

__label__3 To enhance data security, federal privacy legislation is just a startANALYSISAs Chinese companies like TikTok gain access to U.S. markets and ever more data on American citizens, many observers have argued that federal privacy legislation has become a national-security imperative. Yet concerns about China and national security are only two of several reasons for the United States to enact such legislation. When it comes to strengthening privacy, digital trade, and U.S. national security, it’s important to recognize what privacy legislation would and would not accomplish on its own—and why additional steps are needed. A federal privacy law would provide consumers...

Newsom has mandated student Covid-19 vaccines and made big promises on banning sales of gas-powered vehicles. Both pronouncements immediately landed him on the national interview circuit. But Newsom often gives scant details on getting from announcement to action. Lost in his student vaccine mandate was the fact that it likely won't take effect until next summer, once federal officials fully approve a shot and school leaders hash out logistics. Newsom also signed...

According to gun rights advocates, a favorable ruling by the Supreme Court would make it harder for Democrat-led cities to deprive citizens of the right to carry guns in public. “We feel that the suit is: One, to bring equal justice and equal protection to the people, the...
__label__3 Florida GOP limits vaccine mandates, flouting White HouseFlorida Republicans approved a sweeping bill Wednesday to hobble coronavirus vaccine mandates in businesses, rejecting claims that they were sacrificing public health to hand Gov. Ron DeSantis a win in his fight against White House virus rules. Lawmakers in GOP-controlled statehouse expedited the measure, along with a package of virus bills, after hours of debate in which Republicans maintained they were protecting workers from onerous mandates by the federal government. “If you want to get a vaccine, you can get a vaccine. If you don’t want to get a vaccine,...
__label__2 Anti-vaxxers will have to pay up if they want to reject public health guidanceOPINIONLike many Americans, I have grown tired of anti-vaxxer bravado. Suddenly, the people who bragged they’d reject Covid-19 vaccines at all costs — and in the name of so-called liberty — are now beside themselves because they can’t eat indoors at their favorite salad bar unvaccinated. Evidently, the revolution is prepared for many things, but eating stale croutons on a park bench is a bridge too far. The FDA’s approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last month allowed business owners and school administrators to require vaccination for patrons, employees and students. Since then, vaccine mandates have been instituted...
__label__5 Appeals Court Refuses to Stop Maine Vaccine Mandate, Organization Mulls Turning to Supreme CourtThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday refused to issue an emergency injunction to stop Maine’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The three-judge panel of the Boston-based court issued a one-sentence statement saying the request was denied without an explanation, The Bangor Daily News reported. A final ruling will likely be issued next week, according to Liberty Counsel, an organization representing more than 2,000 health care workers across the state in the lawsuit. “We look forward to a decision from the Court of Appeals. If that decision is not favorable, we will request emergency relief from...
__label__2 Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political TypologyDATAPartisan polarization remains the dominant, seemingly unalterable condition of American politics. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little – and when they do, it often is in the shared belief that they have little in common. Yet the gulf that separates Republicans and Democrats sometimes obscures the divisions and diversity of views that exist within both partisan coalitions – and the fact that many Americans do not fit easily into either one. Republicans are divided on some principles long associated with the GOP: an affinity for businesses and corporations, support for...

__label__5 Supreme Court rejects First Amendment lawsuit involving Trump election lawyerThe Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a case involving a prominent Trump legal adviser who was banned from a speaking event due to his conservative views. The Western Justice Center in Pasadena, California, canceled an event by the Pasadena Republican Club on April 20, 2017, because attorney John Eastman was a speaker. Mr. Eastman had advised former President Trump’s legal team on election challenges. The GOP group previously had hosted evening events at the building. But the Western Justice Center, which had authority over city-owned property, banned the group...
__label__3 Virginia’s wake-up call: Democrats ignore rural voters at their perilShortly after Glenn Youngkin secured the Virginia GOP’s gubernatorial nomination, Andy McCready, chair of the Pulaski County Republicans, says he got a call from some data specialists on the Youngkin campaign.   “They sent me a printout of my county and said, ‘A typical Republican turnout in your county is 7,100 voters. Do you think we could get 7,300 voters to come to the polls?’” recalls Mr. McCready over a lunch special at Fatz Cafe, a restaurant off Interstate 81. “And I said, ‘Absolutely.’”  The Youngkin campaign didn’t just meet that...
__label__2 The Looming Crisis of Kids and COVIDOPINIONThe number of school closures due to COVID-19 is increasing alongside pediatric infections as the country's public school system fully reopens – in many places with low vaccination rates and mask-optional policies. More than 1,400 schools across 278 districts in 35 states that began the academic year in person have closed, according to Burbio, an organization that's tracking how schools respond to the ongoing pandemic. The figures are up from 698 schools across 158 districts in 25 states. While the spike in the school closure count is startling many education...
__label__5 Biden Admits to Supreme Court: The ‘Forever War’ Is Not Over, After AllOPINIONTo the extent President Biden’s pull-out from Afghanistan was not criminally negligent, it was pervasively mendacious. There was the president’s lamebrained targeting of September 11 as the withdrawal deadline — a strategic and propaganda boon for the Taliban. There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan...
__label__3 Do election failures mark the end for 'defund the police'?After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020, the city became the epicenter of a nationwide movement pushing for police reform and racial justice. Within two weeks, the Minneapolis City Council vowed to disband its police department and become the first major city to “defund the police.” But, when given the chance to take a major step toward that goal on Tuesday, Minneapolis voters chose to maintain the status quo. A ballot measure that would have moved law enforcement duties under a new Department...
__label__1 The Drug War’s Deepest Failure: Making Users the EnemyANALYSISThe war on drugs may profess to be waged against narcotics, but it overwhelmingly targets people—a view increasingly shared by experts on drug use. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, touched on this recently when she wrote about addiction stigma in STAT, noting that “societal norms surrounding drug use and addiction continue to be informed by myths and misconceptions.” Starting in the 1980s, a rowdy group of individuals began advocating for a different approach to drug policy called harm reduction. These activists, researchers, social workers, attorneys, and others, from...

Justice Amy Coney Barrett will be on the bench for the first time since she was confirmed last year. And Justice Brett...
__label__3 Republican-led states begin legal fight over Biden vaccine mandateMore than 15 states across the U.S. have filed lawsuits against the Biden administration over its federal vaccine mandate for companies with at least 100 employees. Driving the news: Attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday against the administration, calling the mandate "unconstitutional, unlawful and unwise." The states participating in the lawsuit are Missouri, Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, New Hampshire and Wyoming. The lawsuit was primarily brought by 10 Republican attorneys general. Iowa's Democratic attorney general, Tom Miller, also joined in the suit. State of play: On...
__label__2 Purdue Pharma Is Dissolved and Sacklers Pay $4.5 Billion to Settle Opioid ClaimsPurdue Pharma, the maker of the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin, was dissolved on Wednesday in a wide-ranging bankruptcy settlement that will also require the company’s owners, members of the Sackler family, to turn over billions of their fortune to address the deadly opioid epidemic. But the agreement includes a much-disputed condition: It largely absolves the Sacklers of Purdue opioid-related liability. And as such, they will remain among the richest families in the country. Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., provisionally approved the plan, saying...
__label__4 Supreme Court orders Biden to reinstate Trump's 'remain in Mexico' immigration policyThe Supreme Court handed down a defeat for the Biden administration and its effort to end the "remain in Mexico" policy begun by former President Donald Trump in 2019. The highest court in the land said in the 6-3 decision that the policy would have to be reinstated after Biden ordered its end. The controversial policy required those seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico while their documents were being processed. Critics said the policy was racist while supporters said it would prevent those whose applications were denied from staying in...

Adam Kinzinger says he’s eyeing potential GOP run for Illinois governor or U.S. senator after opting out of reelection to CongressLess than a week after announcing he would not seek reelection to Congress under a Democratic redistricting map, Republican U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN Thursday he is weighing possible statewide bids for Illinois governor or U.S. senator in next year’s election. In an interview with the network, the six-term Republican from Channahon said he expected to make a decision on a statewide bid “probably” in January. Candidates are scheduled to begin seeking petition signatures Jan. 13 to appear on the June 28 primary ballot. Kinzinger also said he would not rule...

__label__5 Mississippi Asks US Supreme Court to Overturn Abortion Rights Landmark Roe v. WadeThe state of Mississippi on Thursday urged the U.S. Supreme Court in a major case set to be argued in its next term to overturn the landmark 1973 ruling that recognized that women have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, said in papers filed with the court that the Roe v. Wade ruling and a subsequent 1992 decision that affirmed it were both "egregiously wrong" and that state legislatures should have more leeway to restrict abortion. The court has a 6-3 conservative...
__label__3 Trump, your 2024 GOP nomineeANALYSISFormer President Trump is telling most anyone who'll listen he will run again in 2024 — and poll after poll shows the vast majority of Republicans would gladly cheer him on and vote for him.  Why it matters: Trump is the heart, soul and undisputed leader of the Republican Party and will easily win the nomination if he wants it, the polls make unmistakably clear. It's not just idle chatter. Trump is spending much of his time thinking about politics, holding calls with his political team and surveying polling. Trump is keeping...
__label__1 Those Anti-Covid Plastic Barriers Probably Don’t Help and May Make Things WorseCovid precautions have turned many parts of our world into a giant salad bar, with plastic barriers separating sales clerks from shoppers, dividing customers at nail salons and shielding students from their classmates. Intuition tells us a plastic shield would be protective against germs. But scientists who study aerosols, air flow and ventilation say that much of the time, the barriers don’t help and probably give people a false sense of security. And sometimes the barriers can make things worse. Research suggests that in some instances, a barrier protecting a...
__label__4 Cruz Leads 24 GOP Senators to File Amicus Brief in Supreme Court Case Protecting Second AmendmentSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, led 24 other Republican senators to file an amicus brief, arguing that the New York state laws making it hard to carry a gun outside the home violate the Second Amendment. In regards to the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen case, which is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, the senators wrote, “[L]egislators—whether in Albany or Washington, D.C.—have neither the power nor the authority to second-guess the policy judgments made by the Framers and...
__label__3 Is Trump's power over Republicans starting to slip?ANALYSISDonald Trump's recent visit to Iowa - a key state in the presidential nomination process - has fuelled speculation that he is preparing for a 2024 White House run. With a base that loves him and Republican politicians who defer to him, he is still a powerful force within the party. But if he harbours presidential ambitions, he's not alone - and at least some conservatives aren't fully on board. There was a telling moment during Donald Trump's rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines on Saturday night....
__label__2 11,000 Athletes, No Outbreak: How the Tokyo Olympics Dodged COVIDANALYSISBefore thousands of international athletes and reporters even landed in Tokyo, the Olympics were seen as a horror story waiting to happen. What’s essential in a mega sporting event—confined spaces, crowds and close contacts—also makes fertile ground for COVID-19. Apprehensive and alarmed, the Japanese public overwhelmingly opposed hosting the Tokyo Games. When the time came, everyone bit their fingernails, bracing for headlines of a mass outbreak in the Olympic Village, or even worse, an Olympic variant. But as some 11,000 Olympic athletes packed up after two weeks of competitions, organizers breathed a sigh of relief that their...
__label__5 Social conservatives 'frustrated' over Trump Supreme Court justices' rulingsIt was a line that you would expect to receive thunderous applause.Former Vice President Mike Pence, addressing a crowd of some 1,200 evangelical activists attending the annual leadership summit of the Family Leader, a top social conservative organization in the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus state of Iowa, touted the Trump administration's success in shifting the federal bench to the right.

About one-in-five Republicans (22%) say that while they would like Trump to continue to be a major political figure in the United States, they would prefer he use his stature to support another...
__label__1 Oklahoma is preparing to defy its parole board and kill Julius JonesJust hours before the scheduled execution of Julius Jones, a 41-year-old Black man convicted of a murder he says he didn’t commit, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt still hasn’t said whether he’ll commute the death sentence, as activists have urged. Jones was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2002 for the murder of Oklahoma businessman Paul Howell. Jones, who has always maintained his innocence, and his supporters have pointed to deep flaws in the trial as reason for Stitt, a Republican, to commute his sentence to life in prison.  Specifically, they point to Jones’ defense...
__label__5 Justice Breyer: Not Planning to Retire, Don't Know WhenJustice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court's oldest member, told CNN he has not decided when to retire from the bench. Progressives and some other Democrats have encouraged Breyer to step down so President Joe Biden can name a younger liberal judge to the court while their party holds a slim control of the Senate. When asked by CNN whether he had decided when to retire, Breyer said, "No." Breyer, nominated to his position by former President Bill Clinton in 1994, said two factors will determine his decision. "Primarily, of course, health," Breyer...

__label__4 Biden Falsely Claims Supreme Court Heard 2020 Election ChallengesANALYSISCLAIM: The Supreme Court, among other courts, heard the challenges to the 2020 presidential election results, twice. VERDICT: FALSE. The Supreme Court declined to hear the election challenges, and never considered the evidence. President Joe Biden gave a speech Tuesday in support of Democrats’ controversial voting reform bill, H.R. 1/S. 1, the “For the People Act.” As Breitbart News has previously explained, the legislation “would radically change American democracy, nationalizing elections and making permanent changes to voting rules that would virtually ensure Democrats never lose another election.” In the course of...
__label__3 Senate Republicans Set to Block Bill Tying Short-Term Funding Bill to Debt CeilingSenate Republicans are poised to block a Democratic bill that would both fund the government and raise the country’s borrowing limit, as the parties remain at loggerheads over the government’s finances just days before it runs out of money. Senate Democrats are seeking to pass a House-approved stopgap measure that funds the government through Dec. 3, 2021 and suspends the debt limit through Dec. 16, 2022. They are moving to send the legislation to President Biden’s desk before the government’s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Oct. 1. Democrats have scheduled...

__label__5 The End of the Supreme Court Term Revealed Hysterics Posing as Legal AnalystsOPINIONThe Supreme Court handed down the final rulings of its term last week, with both of them breaking down along ideological lines; the six Republican-appointed justices residing in the majority, their three Democratic counterparts dissenting. Naturally, those entrusted with interpreting the legal jargon of these judicial opinions for the general public saw this for the responsibility it is. Well, some of them did. Others, such as The Nation’s Elie Mystal, used their platform to deceive and divide. In a guest appearance on Joy Reid’s MSNBC show, Mystal asserted that Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion in Brnovich v.

Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio announced he would not seek reelection in 2022. The 37-year old congressman was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and he is now the first to call it quits. Facing fervent opposition from Trump supporters in his district, a Trump-backed primary challenger and a potentially thorny redistricting process — Ohio will lose a congressional district after apportionment — Gonzalez decided there was no future for him in the GOP.

This one said that one of their neighbors was looking for Mr. Al-Abdrabbuh. The neighbor was threatening to kill him. Like many school board races this year, the one in May in Corvallis,...
__label__4 Biden's environmentalism is pummeling the nationOPINIONPresident Joe Biden inherited a great gift from the Trump administration: energy independence. The benefits cannot be overstated: Cheap, reliable energy is key to economic growth and broad-based prosperity. Yet Biden has squandered this advantage. Retail gas prices are up 55.95% from last year, with California gas prices hitting nearly $8 a gallon . This has hit pocketbooks directly through costs to keep the lights and heat on in homes, and indirectly through rising prices for all sorts of goods, the production and transportation of which require the use of more expensive...
__label__3 Decision time: Three ways the California recall election could goFor nearly 25 years, Gov. Gavin Newsom rose the ranks of California politics without ever losing an election, buoyed by connections to powerful San Francisco Democrats and a willingness to take risks — like sanctinoing same-sex marriage — that put him at the vanguard of his party. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.  The governor’s attention-grabbing style — implementing the nation’s first stay-at-home order in March 2020, then dining at an exclusive wine country restaurant as he told people to stay home to avoid a winter surge — rubbed enough Californians...

More than 1,148,000 Americans were employed in the fuels industry in 2019, according to a joint report produced by the National Association of State Energy Officials and the Energy Futures Initiative.

What Happened to Them?ANALYSISIt’s been a long time since I sat in an American history class, but what I remember of my education in Jacksonville, Florida, in the 1980s and ’90s is how much of it was not fact, but myth. I was taught that the Civil War was fought over states’ rights—a concept that seemed plausibly defensible to a kid—and that “our side” had its own heroes and its own stories worth remembering. Several of my relatives who live in north Florida still fly the Confederate flag on their boats and paste...

A Sheriff’s Deputy Arrived — and Beat Her More.The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office is investigating a deputy accused of holding a Black woman by her hair and slamming her head repeatedly into the pavement with such force that a witness to the Sept. 20 incident said it ripped several of Shantel Arnold’s braids from her scalp. A 14-second video captured the incident in the New Orleans suburb where, for decades, Black residents have accused the Sheriff’s Office of targeting them. It was the second time that hour that Arnold had been assaulted. By the time the deputies arrived, she said...
__label__5 Climate backfire: Coal-fired power jumps as natural gas prices soarCoal-fired electricity generation climbed this year in the U.S. for the first time since the Obama administration, spurred by spiking natural gas prices, a setback for the Biden climate agenda and a sign that the president’s drilling crackdown may be backfiring. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday that electricity generated by coal-fired plants is expected to jump by 22% in 2021 over last year’s levels for the first year-over-year increase since 2014. The reason: the rising cost of natural gas, which began climbing in April and hit a 13-year...
__label__3 Free speech in a pandemic: Congress wrestles with drawing a lineWhen Twitter recently banned a former New York Times journalist dubbed “the pandemic’s wrongest man,” many of his critics cheered. But others, including some who oppose his views, raised concerns about a world in which private corporations – taking their cues from mainstream media and government officials – can silence dissenters in today’s digital public square. Over the past year and a half, Alex Berenson grew his Twitter base to some 344,000 followers by pillorying public health officials’ approach to the pandemic. Like many Twitter pundits, he was irreverent and provocative....
__label__2 Minneapolis Inches Closer to Disbanding Its Police DepartmentOPINIONIt’s no secret that the Minneapolis Police Department—like many other police departments across the country—has disproportionately brutalized Black communities. The nation caught a glimpse of this brutality last year in the widely circulated video clip that showed George Floyd gasping for air under the knee of a uniformed white police officer. Police use of excessive force against Black Americans, who represent 20 percent of the city’s general population, has remained a common phenomenon for decades. Between 2015 and 2020, as a New York Times analysis concluded, Minneapolis police officers were seven times more...

Prime Minister Scott Morrison knows that the burden is too heavy. “This is not a sustainable way to live in this country,” he recently declared. One prominent civil libertarian summed up the rules by lamenting, “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes.” Up to now one of Earth’s freest societies, Australia has become a hermit continent. How long can a country maintain emergency restrictions on its citizens’ lives...

The second Black justice on the Supreme Court made a rare public appearance at the university, following a year of social unrest, racial tension and politicization of classroom teachings. During the talk, he compared experiences in his youth to current events. "Every time I walked into a room, I had to look for something in common, and that's the way we grew up," Thomas said to...
__label__4 Biden Must Create New Taxes, Eliminate Natural Gas to Meet Climate Pledge, Analysts SayANALYSISPresident Joe Biden would need to implement a massive tax on emissions and conduct a near elimination of natural gas to meet his climate goals, according to left-leaning environmental experts. Biden will join world leaders at the United Nations' climate change conference in November to discuss his administration's pledge to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 50 to 52 percent by 2030.

__label__2 More Americans now say government should take steps to restrict false information online than in 2018DATAAmid rising concerns over misinformation online – including surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, especially vaccines – Americans are now a bit more open to the idea of the U.S. government taking steps to restrict false information online. And a majority of the public continues to favor technology companies taking such action, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Roughly half of U.S. adults (48%) now say the government should take steps to restrict false information, even if it means losing some freedom to access and publish content, according to the survey...

__label__3 Biden Administration Moves to Tilt Pay and Power Toward WorkersPresident Biden is advancing a series of regulatory changes aimed at increasing workers’ pay and gaining them other benefits, moves that opponents say could burden businesses amid an uneven economic recovery. The rule changes, most of which are still in progress, would affect workers such as federal contractors, tipped employees and workers who are jointly employed, such as those with jobs at franchised brands. In some cases, the changes seek to reverse Trump administration efforts. In others, the Labor Department is working to implement its own rules. What policies would...
__label__2 Could sweeping changes be coming to immigration laws? Advocates hope budget bill is the answerWASHINGTON – For decades, lawmakers and immigrant advocates have been working to pass immigration reform on Capitol Hill, often looking to pass bipartisan legislation to extend protections and pathways to citizenship for farmworkers and those who are undocumented. Success has been elusive, but advocates and some members of Congress see the $3.5 trillion budget bill that Democrats and President Joe Biden want to pass this fall as one of their best bets of passing sweeping changes to the nation's immigration laws.  Democrats are hoping to include in the bill pathways to...
__label__4 Build Back Better Bill Would Lavish New Corporate Subsidies on Biofuel IndustryANALYSISPresident Joe Biden has defended the tax increases he's proposed to pay for his Build Back Better plan on the grounds that they'll level the playing field between the rich and the rest of us. "It's fiscally responsible, because our investments are paid for that by making sure that corporations and the wealthy Americans pay their fair share," said the president in a White House speech Thursday. That rhetoric is in friction with some of the details of the $3.5 billion Build Back Better bill currently working its way through the House. It would...
__label__3 We Disagree on a Lot of Things. Except the Danger of Anti-Critical Race Theory Laws.OPINIONWhat is the purpose of a liberal education? This is the question at the heart of a bitter debate that has been roiling the nation for months. Schools, particularly at the kindergarten-to-12th-grade level, are responsible for helping turn students into well-informed and discerning citizens. At their best, our nation’s schools equip young minds to grapple with complexity and navigate our differences. At their worst, they resemble indoctrination factories. In recent weeks, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Iowa, Idaho and Texas have passed legislation that places significant restrictions on what can be taught in...
__label__2 The browning of America will be Whiter than we realizeOPINIONCutting taxes for the rich helps the poor. There is no such thing as a Republican or a Democratic judge. Climate change is a hoax. Some political myths refuse to die despite all evidence the contrary. Here's another: When White people are no longer a majority, racism will fade and the US "will never be a White country again." This myth was reinforced recently when the US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790. The majority of...

"If Congress changes hands in a couple years here and a Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee asks for Hunter Biden's tax returns, are we just going to say, 'Oh, sure. You know, we've got to defer to Congress. They've said they're interested in legislating on presidential families,...

Will the crisis prompt reforms in children’s welfare that family advocates say are long overdue? Charlee Roos loved the “buddyship days” she shared with her father when she was a kid.

__label__1 Staggering US wealth inequality heaps long-term harm on to minority childrenAfrican American children are suffering long-term disadvantages as a result of vast and growing disparities in the wealth of US families, with Black families with kids having access to barely 1 cent for every dollar enjoyed by their white counterparts. The shocking racial wealth gap between families, and its impact on Black and Hispanic kids, is revealed in groundbreaking new research by scholars on US inequality. It shows that the basic wealth levels of families from different racial and ethnic backgrounds have diverged to such a stark degree in the...
__label__5 Biden plan to hire 80K IRS agents will backfire, letting wealthy dodge taxes, expert warnsPresident Biden’s proposed tax hikes and plan to hire more than 80,000 additional Internal Revenue Service agents could wind up helping the super-wealthy to avoid paying their fair share, according to a new analysis. The new system of tax hikes and credits that Democrats are championing in the $1.75 trillion social welfare and climate bill would also complicate the tax code and make enforcement difficult, said a report Thursday from the libertarian Cato Institute. The new complications, irrespective of beefed-up enforcement, do nothing to close the gap between taxes owed to the...
__label__3 California has the most gun-control laws in US. Do they work?ANALYSISCalifornia is by far the most regulated state in America when it comes to restricting the sale, use, and ownership of guns. Gun-control advocates call it the national leader, the “tip of the spear” setting the tone for other states, as Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at Brady, a gun-control advocacy group, puts it. The Golden State also has had a series of high-profile public mass shootings in recent years – in San Bernardino, Thousand Oaks, and this week, San Jose. On May 26, a gunman opened fire on...

__label__5 IRS Adjusts Tax Brackets As Inflation Hits 30-Year HighThe Internal Revenue Service revealed that it would adjust federal income tax brackets and deductions in light of rising price levels in the United States. On Wednesday, the Department of Labor announced that year-over-year inflation for consumer prices reached 6.2% in October — the highest increase in thirty years. Prices for fuel, used vehicles, and food saw significant increases.

__label__3 Should menthol cigarettes be banned?The Food and Drug Administration announced last week that it would begin the process of banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. The move comes after years of public pressure and legal challenges from anti-smoking groups aimed at compelling the FDA to follow through on its own recommendation that menthol cigarettes be banned. Menthol is a substance that can be derived from mint plants or created synthetically. It was first added to cigarettes in the 1920s, when manufacturers learned that in addition to its flavoring, menthol creates a cooling sensation in...

As he sits there, someone in a canoe comes by and offers to carry him to safety. “No, thanks,” the man replies. “God will save me.” The man paddles off, and the waters continue to rise. Shortly afterward, someone in a boat pulls up to offer help. “No, thank you,” the man says again. “God will deliver me.” The waters rise higher. Finally,...

Cindy Axne (D-IA) claimed last week that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will cost Iowans “literally nothing.” VERDICT: False. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will stick Americans with trillions more in debt. “This cost Iowans literally nothing,” Rep. Axne said of the far-left’s agenda during an interview on Let’s Talk Guthrie County. “If you’re making under $400,000, you know what you’re going to get? A tax break.

__label__3 The media’s epic failANALYSISA reckoning is hitting news organizations for years-old coverage of the 2017 Steele dossier, after the document's primary source was charged with lying to the FBI. Why it matters: It's one of the most egregious journalistic errors in modern history, and the media's response to its own mistakes has so far been tepid. Outsized coverage of the unvetted document drove a media frenzy at the start of Donald Trump's presidency that helped drive a narrative of collusion between former President Trump and Russia.  It also helped drive an even bigger wedge between former...

Video released by the Vatican showed several warm, relaxed moments between Francis and Biden as they repeatedly shook hands and smiled. Francis often sports a dour look, especially in official photos, but he seemed in...
__label__4 Dems Abandon Billionaire Tax That Faced Constitutional HurdlesAn aborted Democratic plan to tax assets held by billionaires was vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds, experts told the Washington Free Beacon. The Constitution authorizes three forms of taxation, and tax-law gurus interviewed by the Free Beacon said the ill-fated billionaire's tax did not fit neatly in any of those categories. The measure would have taxed assets that appreciate in value year over year—like a stock or a closely held company—which aren't currently taxed until they're sold. Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) on Wednesday morning unveiled the billionaire's tax...

__label__5 Democrats' Proposed 'Billionaire Tax' Is Definitely a Wealth Tax, and It May Be UnconstitutionalOPINIONPresident Joe Biden got himself elected partly by opposing the billionaires' wealth tax proposed during the primary campaign by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.). Now, in a reversal, Biden is preparing to embrace the idea. It wouldn't be the first time that a presidential candidate's plans changed after getting elected. The shamelessness of the way that Biden has shifted on the issue, though, is something else. It risks undercutting Biden's claim to being a voice of moderation. It also may reinforce voter cynicism. How's democracy supposed to...

It was the first of this term's major legal disputes to be heard with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, an appointee of President Donald Trump, on the court.

The president said this week he has agreed to cut the mammoth $3.5 trillion price tag, and reports have suggested lawmakers will land somewhere between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion.

To try and find an additional $7 trillion in taxes over the next decade, Joe Biden is floating a plan that would empower the IRS to access any account with $600 in gross transactions (Democrats upped the number to $10,000 this week, after considerable blowback.) In addition to more IRS oversight — scooping, spying, ferreting out, keeping tabs, what have you — Biden also proposed doubling the amount of IRS agents and funding the agency six times...

"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes," the speaker said. Then she waved aside the questioner's accurate comment that banks have reported customer concerns about the idea that the IRS would scrutinize accounts with inflows and outflows as low as $600. "With all due respect, the plural of anecdote is not data," Pelosi said, disrespectfully. "Yes, there are...

The changes, years in the making, are in part a response to the church’s raft of abuse and financial scandals — which have often been magnified by secretive, highly subjective decision-making about how and whether to apply punishments. Pope Francis, in a letter accompanying the revisions, said the laws are intended to be clearer...
__label__5 Infrastructure Bill May Violate Biden 'Red Line' With 'Per-Mile User Fee'Despite President Joe Biden's supposed "red line" on raising taxes for those making less than $400,000, the draft infrastructure bill in the Senate includes a "national motor vehicle per-mile user fee pilot" program. If that remained in the bill, it would take future legislation in order for Biden to keep his promise not to raise taxes on lower-income Americans, the Washington Examiner reported. White House officials had been adamant Biden will not support a gas tax or user fees like the mileage pilot program, but section 13002 of the 2,702-page initial...
__label__3 Keeping the lid on: Biden seeks to control three foreign crisesRussia threatens Ukraine, China threatens Taiwan, Iran threatens to go nuclear. President Biden must navigate some complex geopolitical shoals to keep political showdowns from becoming military meltdowns. There’s an old adage about London buses: You can wait forever and, all of a sudden, three show up at once. Yet for President Joe Biden and America’s allies, the sudden concern isn’t buses. It’s a trio of military flashpoints – in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East – involving three increasingly assertive U.S. rivals: Russia, China, and Iran. Each daunting...
__label__2 QAnon is spreading amongst evangelicals. These pastors are trying to stop itANALYSISWhen Pastor James Kendall stepped on to the stage of his small church in Madera, California he knew that day's sermon was going to take him in a direction unlike most. He had seen some troubling Facebook posts from members of his congregation. God, he says, was telling him speak out and warn his flock. "I don't like to get off track and off the Bible," Kendall said during a sermon on March 7. "But as a pastor I do have to guard the flock." A false prophet was gaining a foothold...
__label__4 Trump moves to block effort to get his tax returns after DOJ gave green lightLawyers for former President Donald Trump moved to block House Democratic efforts to obtain his tax returns, blasting the push as a political attempt to harm him following the Justice Department greenlighting the effort. Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts had requested six years of Trump's tax returns and those of eight Trump-associated businesses in April 2019. Then-Treasury Secretary Mnuchin rejected the effort in May 2019, and was backed up by the Trump DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel in June 2019. But the Biden DOJ concluded in...
__label__3 Worse than the Cold War? US-Russia relations hit new low.Russia’s relations with the West, and the United States in particular, appear to be plumbing depths of acrimony and mutual misunderstanding unseen even during the original Cold War. After years of deteriorating relations, sanctions, tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions, and an escalating “information war,” some in Moscow are asking if there even is any point in seeking renewed dialogue with the U.S., if only out of concern that more talking might just make things worse. Events have cascaded over the past month. Russia’s treatment of imprisoned dissident Alexei Navalny, who has been...
__label__2 Alabama Lifts Three-Decade-Old Ban on Yoga in Public Schools. But There’s a Catch.ANALYSISAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill Thursday lifting a nearly three-decade-old ban on teaching yoga in the state’s public school system. The bill, which sailed through the Republican-dominated statehouse, undoes a 1993 Alabama board of education move to prohibit the practice of yoga as well as meditation in the state’s schools, a push that was fueled by what the Montgomery Advertiser described as “moral panic” among the state’s right-wing, conservative set. Now, 28 years later, the state is ready to grow up and move on and will allow local school boards to decide...
__label__5 Democrats target rich people’s retirement accounts to pay for progressive wish-list items in $3.5T spending billANALYSISThe lawmakers are reportedly 'aghast' that some have millions while others have next to nothing in retirement savings. Democrats on Capitol Hill are reportedly setting their sights on wealthy people's "super-sized retirement savings accounts" as one way to pay for a litany of progressive wish-list items included in their mammoth $3.5 trillion spending plan. Politico reported Tuesday that congressional Democrats are "aghast" that some people have managed their wealth responsibly and amassed multimillion-dollar individual retirement accounts while others have next to nothing — an unacceptable imbalance in the democratic-socialist state the...
__label__3 Russia to expel 10 U.S diplomats, ban top Biden officials in response to sanctionsRussia will expel 10 U.S. diplomats and add eight current and former U.S. officials to its no-entry list in retaliation for sanctions that the Biden administration leveled at Moscow on Friday, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday. Why it matters: The measures come after the U.S. said it would expel 10 Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover, as part of a broad package of sanctions retaliating against the SolarWinds hack of federal agencies and Russia's interference in the 2020 election. Details: The following Americans have been banned from...
__label__2 Pelosi’s archbishop says prominent Catholics who support abortion rights should be denied CommunionThe Most Rev. Salvatore J. Cordileone was careful not to name any Catholics in his latest letter calling for Holy Communion to be withheld from public figures who support abortion rights. But the 17-page missive from the archbishop of San Francisco may have important implications for one of the archdiocese’s most famous parishioners: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi, a California Democrat and high-profile Catholic, has long supported women’s right to access abortion care — and, for nearly as long, she has come under fire from those who say her views...
__label__5 Taxes Separate Dying Illinois From Thriving MissouriANALYSISOn the I-57 highway through Illinois, time seems to go backward with each southbound mile. The houses and cars in the yards get older. As years pass, town populations shrink. Eventually, homes turn back into piles of disconnected wood and glass, then empty lots. At the end of the highway, the town of Cairo slowly sinks back into the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. A town of 15,000 people in the 1920s, Cairo now houses fewer than 2,000 residents. Today, the town is so silent that the few voices heard while...
__label__3 U.S. imposes wide array of sanctions on Russia for 'malign' actionsThe United States on Thursday imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia to punish it for alleged interference in the U.S. election, cyber-hacking, bullying Ukraine and other “malign” acts. The measures blacklisted Russian companies, expelled Russian diplomats and placed limits on the Russian sovereign debt market. More penalties could come, although Washington did not want to escalate matters, the Biden administration said. Moscow reacted angrily, saying this dangerously raised the temperature between the two countries. It summoned the U.S. ambassador for what it said would be a tough conversation....
__label__2 NYC man arrested on hate crime charges for vandalizing synagogues as antisemitic incidents remain historically highSurveillance footage showing a man hurling rocks through the doors and windows of houses of worship in New York City left community leaders on edge. Over the weekend, police arrested a 29-year-old man on hate crime charges in connection with the vandalization of several Bronx synagogues, which included the destruction of prayer books.  The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force announced Saturday that they arrested Jordan Burnette, who is from the Bronx, for refusing to cooperate with officers and provide proper identification after he was stopped for riding a bicycle...
__label__5 Biden’s ‘Double Death Tax’OPINIONFor more than a generation, Republicans have rallied to the flag of “kill the death tax,” and for good reason: Poll after poll shows it to be the tax that ordinary Americans find the most unfair. Democrats, understanding this, have cooperated (however reluctantly) in reducing the tax (its rate has fallen from 55 percent to 40 percent this century) and expanding the exemption to it (now as high as $25 million for a married couple). And on the state level, death taxes have all but disappeared from tax codes. Yet now, the “norms restoring” Biden administration is attempting to double...
__label__3 Dr. Fauci troubled by political divide over Covid science, says it’s hampered pandemic responseChief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a new interview that there is a “very disconcerting” politically partisan divide over science in the United States, which has hampered the nation’s response to the Covid pandemic. Fauci noted that “because I am representing science” in telling people to get coronavirus vaccinations and to continue to wear masks, “I get attacked” in the form of death threats which require him to have protection by federal agents. “What we’re seeing is a public health issue which requires synergy among all elements of our...

California had limited indoor gatherings to three households or fewer, with different rules for other places.
__label__4 The Return of the Tea PartyOPINIONBeing told what to do by epidemiologists and officials wielding SCIENCE as their authority has been enough to bring Tea Party–era liberty back in vogue. It’s 2009 again, or feels like it. That was when spontaneous, grassroots protests against overweening government sprang up and were widely derided in the media as dangerous and wrong-headed. The protesters then were inveighing against Obamacare; the protesters now are striking out against the coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown agitation shows that, despite the revolution in Republican politics wrought by President Donald Trump, opposition to government...
__label__3 America’s Return to the Moon Will Have to Wait a YearU.S. astronauts are now expected to return to the moon in 2025 instead of 2024, with NASA Administrator Bill Nelson describing the earlier time frame as unrealistic for technical reasons. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been preparing to send two astronauts back to the lunar surface as part of its Artemis moon program, with the Trump administration previously setting a goal of landing them there by 2024. At a briefing Tuesday, Mr. Nelson questioned whether the original time frame for returning people to the moon was ever viable. “Trump administration...
__label__2 Menace, as a Political Tool, Enters the Republican MainstreamThreats of violence have become commonplace among a significant part of the party, as historians and those who study democracy warn of a dark shift in American politics. At a conservative rally in western Idaho last month, a young man stepped up to a microphone to ask when he could start killing Democrats. “When do we get to use the guns?” he said as the audience applauded. “How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?” The local state representative, a Republican, later called it a “fair” question.

__label__4 Blue State Blues: A Decade of Fake NewsThe idea of a “decade in review” article at the end of 2019 is a bit of “fake news.” Technically, the current decade does not end until December 31, 2020.In that spirit, it is worth looking back at the past ten years through the “fake news” lens. These were years in which the mainstream media used false allegations and biased reporting to suppress conservative voices; they were also the first years in which, thanks to Andrew Breitbart, we began to resist them.
__label__3 The magic 1.5: What’s behind climate talks’ key elusive goalANALYSISOne phrase, really just a number, dominates climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland: The magic and elusive 1.5. That stands for the international goal of trying to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s a somewhat confusing number in some ways that wasn’t a major part of negotiations just seven years ago and was a political suggestion that later proved to be incredibly important scientifically. Stopping warming at 1.5 or so can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms...
__label__2 No One Is Prepared for the New GerrymandersOPINIONToward the end of the last decade, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices effectively abolished constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering. But don’t worry about it, Chief Justice John Roberts told the country: You, the citizens, can fix this problem yourselves! States “are actively addressing the issue on a number of fronts,” Roberts promised, and Congress isn’t far behind. “The avenue for reform established by the Framers,” he assured readers, “and used by Congress in the past, remains open.” Two years later, this passage reads like a twisted joke....

As of Tuesday, vote counts show Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by The Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are under 0.5%, which...

__label__3 The 2021 physics Nobel upholds the grim truths of climate scienceANALYSISWhen Syukuro Manabe was working on his PhD at the University of Tokyo, late in the 1950s, he was part of a team that tried to predict rainfall. The team’s methods now seem painstaking and rudimentary: testing air to see how much moisture condensed out of it, and using those measurements to extrapolate the likelihood of future rain. And if predicting daily weather was hard, modeling the climate seemed even more daunting. You had to get the water cycle right, but you also had to know how the Earth absorbed...
__label__2 Republican wave builds to take back the HouseRepublicans could hardly be better poised to recapture the House majority. Increasingly aggressive redistricting, a diverse slate of candidates raking in record-breaking amounts of cash and a political atmosphere that just keeps getting more favorable has Democrats watching with a growing sense of dread. Last week alone, the GOP saw the stirrings of a full-fledged suburban revival from Virginia to New Jersey to New York — and also possibly ended the careers of as many five Democratic incumbents with punishing new congressional maps in three other states. Republicans were plotting to cement...
__label__5 IRS tea party targeting accusations, legal issues persist after Justice ends probeThe IRS is still holding up the nonprofit applications of tea party groups - including one that has been waiting nearly six years for approval - as conservatives panned the Justice Departments announcement last week that it had cleared the tax agency and former senior executive Lois G.

__label__1 Republicans Once Supported the Voting Rights Act. Today, They Voted Against its Restoration.ANALYSISOn Wednesday afternoon, GOP senators blocked Democrats from advancing a key voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, marking the second time in two weeks and the fourth time this year that Republicans have filibustered voting rights legislation that would combat GOP voter suppression efforts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it a “low, low point in the history of this body.” Republicans have now prevented three different voting rights bills introduced by Democrats from reaching the Senate floor. This repeated obstruction is likely to embolden top...

__label__1 How Republicans used Senate delays to make changes at U.S. product safety regulator. Critics call it a ‘power grab’ that puts public at risk.A short-lived Republican majority atop the nation’s product safety regulator — the result of Senate delays in confirming Democratic nominees — recently pushed through dozens of last-minute changes to the agency’s annual plan, slowing work on some safety rules and abandoning at least one enforcement effort altogether. The changes mean the Consumer Product Safety Commission no longer plans in the coming year to draw up new mandatory rules for preventing suffocation in infant nursing pillows or carbon monoxide poisoning from gas appliances. The amended plan also canceled a pilot project...

Time for right and left to team up and end this madness.

Meanwhile, it’s been 230 days since the House of Representatives passed federal legislation—the For the People Act—that would roll back the gerrymandering and voter suppression enacted by GOP-controlled states such as Texas, but the Senate has taken no action to protect voting rights while Republican-dominated states relentlessly undermine them.

__label__3 Ending unemployment benefits had little impact on jobs and fueled $2 billion spending cut, study findsStates that withdrew early from federal unemployment programs pushed few people back to work and fueled a nearly $2 billion cut in household spending, potentially hurting their local economies, according to new research. Twenty-six state governors — all Republican, except one — opted out of the pandemic-era programs several weeks before their official expiration on Labor Day. Enhanced benefits were keeping the unemployed from looking for jobs and fueling a labor shortage, they claimed. That bet seems to have had a limited payoff so far, according to a paper authored by economists...

__label__3 Democratic, Republican Confidence in Science DivergesDATASixty-four percent of U.S. adults say they have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in science, compared with 70% when Gallup last measured it more than four decades ago. The modest decline overall obscures more significant changes among political partisans. Republicans today are much less likely than their predecessors in 1975 to have confidence in science. Meanwhile, Democrats today have more confidence than their fellow partisans did in the past.
__label__1 The GOP Is Going After Pennsylvania Voters’ Most Sensitive DataANALYSISAfter months of pressure from former President Donald Trump, who lost the state but claims it was stolen, Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers are subpoenaing voter data as part of a shambolic probe into the 2020 election. As part of the subpoena, which passed a Republican-led state Senate committee Wednesday morning, legislators are seeking troves of information about the 2020 election: The names and dates of birth, addresses, and partial social security numbers of every registered voter in Pennsylvania as of November 2020 from the state Secretary of State, as well as...

__label__3 What Science is MissingANALYSISChanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical physicist at the University of New Hampshire, is one of about 100 Black American women physicists, but she nearly left the field in her first semester in college. She isn't the only scientist of color who thought of giving up before her career began. Why it matters: Scientists and institutions have stepped up efforts in the year since George Floyd's murder to redress the underrepresentation of people like Prescod-Weinstein and other scientists of color among their ranks. That marginalization affects not only who pursues science as a career...
__label__2 Republicans attack Biden's COVID vaccine plan and threaten court challengesRepublican candidates and conservative activists are planning to attack President Joe Biden's COVID vaccine mandates in court and on the campaign trail, but they face uphill battles in trying to block the plan. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus on Friday denounced Biden's plan as "another attempt by the Biden Regime to expand its control over Americans' daily lives." Biden on Thursday announced a number of stringent vaccine requirements, including a plan to require business over 100 people to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly. Polls show vaccine mandates are popular with...
__label__5 Schumer: Immigration reform possible in 2014 because of Boehner’s tea party breakSen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said he thinks Congress will reform immigration in 2014 because of Speaker John A. Boehner’s break with the tea party during the budget debate. “For the first time, Speaker Boehner said he won’t let the minority of his caucus — the tea party minority — run the show,” Mr. Schumer said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, criticized tea party members of his caucus as well as outside conservative organizations who came out against the...
__label__3 Hubble Space Telescope Is Back in Action After NASA Fixes Odd GlitchAfter a month of frantic tinkering, NASA said Friday that its aging Hubble Space Telescope was on the mend, recovering from a computer problem that crippled what many astronomers call the most productive scientific instrument ever built. As the bus-size observatory circled Earth, space agency engineers worked by remote control to switch Hubble from its vintage electronics to backup hardware. In the final step, they powered up a payload computer that restored control of its six cameras and sensors, which peer through visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light to...
__label__2 America's Only LGBTQ Historic District Is Falling ApartANALYSISOne of North America’s first openly lesbian poets launched her career by pissing off H.P. Lovecraft. In 1918, at the age of 19, Elsa Gidlow started publishing North America’s first known LGBTQ-themed magazine out of her home in Montreal. Combining queer poetry, one-act plays about young gay love, and progressive social commentary, Les mouches fantastiques quickly gained a cult following far beyond the city and even Canada—culminating in a back-and-forth literary journal spat with the noted horror writer (and racist), who decried the magazine’s promotion of an “ancient selfish hedonism.” In 1920, Gidlow moved...
__label__4 Tea Party steps up war of words against Boehner over budget voteTea party activists are pushing back hard against Speaker John Boehner for attacking conservative groups that are opposed to bipartisan budget legislation approved this week by the House, claiming he has "declared war on the Tea Party" with his blunt criticism. In a fundraising email to supporters, Tea Party Patriots referred to the Ohio Republican as a "ruling class politician" who only pretends to be a conservative while remaining a "tax-and-spend liberal," The Hill reported Friday.
__label__3 The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the CoronavirusANALYSISA year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic — and with a death toll approaching 4 million lives — how the coronavirus came to spark a global scourge remains unknown. Was it the result of a spillover from an animal to a human, as has happened repeatedly in the past? Or did the virus accidentally escape from a nearby lab? The default answer for most scientists has been that the virus, SARS-CoV-2, probably made the jump to humans from bats, if it was a direct spillover — or, more likely, through...
__label__1 Column: Biden’s in deep trouble. He can still bounce backOPINIONWhen Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he had all the advantages of a nonincumbent in a year when everything had gone wrong. Biden waged a careful, disciplined campaign, built around a simple message: He would end the pandemic, rebuild the economy and restore normalcy. After the chaos of the Trump years, that was enough. Governing has been more difficult. The pandemic, fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, didn’t end. The economy’s recovery has come with worrisome inflation, shortages and supply chain problems. In public opinion polls,...
__label__5 Conspicuously missing in Facebook whistleblower dumps is any hint of worry about left-wing hate and liesOPINIONAs whistleblowers continue to dump documents revealing internal Facebook discussions about controlling content, one thing is striking: The thousands of pages released so far contain zero signs of staff worries about (or even awareness of) left-wing hate speech and misinformation. Perhaps we’re only seeing part of the picture. But Facebook staffers’ incessant drive to censor right-wing stories and sites suggests they really are blind to the often-outrageous speech from outlets on the other side of the spectrum. The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster report this week detailed how the social-media giant’s “employees have consistently pushed to suppress or de-platform...
__label__3 UFOs, once consigned to conspiracy theories, have landed in mainstream American journalismLast Friday, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report that many were eagerly awaiting: a preliminary assessment on unidentified aerial phenomena. In layman’s terms, UFOs. The unclassified report said these phenomena clearly pose a flight safety issue but that there aren’t enough high-quality reports on them to draw any firm conclusions. Sightings of UFOs have been reported throughout history in different parts of the world. In the U.S., these unidentified flying objects have been repeatedly investigated over the decades and perhaps forever embedded in our culture. And journalists have been there to report...
__label__2 How These Ultrawealthy Politicians Avoided Paying TaxesAs a member of Congress, Jared Polis was one of the loudest Democrats demanding President Donald Trump release his tax returns. At a rally in Denver in 2017, he warned the crowd that Trump “might have something to hide.” That same year, on the floor of the House, he introduced a resolution to force the president to release the records, calling them an “important baseline disclosure.” But during Polis’ successful run for governor of Colorado in 2018, his calls for transparency faded. The dot-com tycoon turned investor broke with recent...
__label__4 Facebook And The LawOPINIONIn the early chapters of his letter to the Romans, St. Paul describes how humanity stands condemned before God’s law, guilty of falling short of the justice we were made for. Both the law that is written on our hearts, often called the natural law, and the law of revelation, given unto Moses, show a standard of being fully human that, the apostle reminds his readers, only Jesus Christ has fulfilled. And so God became man so that man might become God, as the Athanasian formula puts it, because man...
__label__3 DOJ reviewing decision not to charge FBI agents in Nassar investigationThe Justice Department said Tuesday it is reviewing a previous decision not to charge FBI agents accused of mishandling the investigation into disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Why it matters: Less than a month ago, FBI director Christopher Wray formally apologized to the U.S. gymnasts abused by Nassar, noting that the FBI's failure to stop Nassar was "inexcusable." His apology came after four gymnasts — including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney — testified before the committee and detailed how the FBI mishandled their reports.
__label__1 Corporations Control Canada’s Infrastructure — But the Major Parties Won’t Confront ThemOPINIONConfident that he will be able to secure a third term in office, Justin Trudeau has called a federal election. His gambit is a bold one and may backfire — the election, scheduled for this Monday, is taking place against a backdrop of a series of long-standing crises. First and foremost is the damage inflicted on Canadian society by the global pandemic, which the country has failed to curb. The climate crisis, made salient by a summer of extreme and deadly weather, also looms large. In June, members of the...
__label__5 Washington’s Whistleblower Show: On Free Enterprise, the Right Turns LeftOPINIONShould we outlaw the telephone, too . . . or at least put progressives in charge of what we’re allowed to discuss on it? Or maybe we should shut down the encyclopedia business . . . after all, some of the information in those tomes could really upset teenagers. Absurd, I know. But we live in an age when what was absurd a nanosecond ago becomes mandatory. The question of suppressing the instrumentalities that facilitate communication in a free society presses thanks to the star turn of Frances Haugen, the so-called...
__label__3 New York Assembly to release report on Cuomo investigationLawmakers in the New York State Assembly will issue a report on their investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo after abandoning an impeachment effort in light of his resignation over complaints of sexual harassment, members said. The Assembly's Judiciary Committee began an impeachment investigation in March after two women who worked for Cuomo went public with complaints of sexual harassment. The state's attorney general released a damning report this month concluding that the Democratic governor had kissed, groped or made unwelcome sexual advances to at least 11 women, including aides and...
__label__2 Biden administration opens investigation into Florida’s school masking policiesFederal education authorities on Friday opened an investigation into Florida’s attempts to block mask mandates in local schools, marking the latest dust up between the Biden administration and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over Covid-19 policies. The U.S. Department of Education’s civil rights office is probing Florida over a contentious state rule that requires all schools to grant parents the ability to opt their children out of wearing masks, claiming that it could violate the rights of students with disabilities. “[The U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights office] is concerned that Florida’s policy...
__label__5 Facebook, Instagram users report trouble logging on just days after global outageFacebook acknowledged that some users were unable to access its platforms on Friday afternoon, days after an outage knocked the social media company’s services offline for several hours. Down Detector noted a surge in outage notices for Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp around 2 p.m. ET. Facebook said it was aware of the issues in a Twitter post. "We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience," Facebook representatives said in the post.
__label__3 In Barely A Year, Gov. Cuomo Went From A Pandemic Hero To A Political PariahIn the space of just over a year, N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo went from a pandemic "hero," watched daily by millions of people, to a flattened politician under intense pressure to step down after 11 women came forward to accuse him of unwelcome touching and inappropriate comments. The Democrat tried to hang on amid an intensifying scandal until N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James released an exhaustive report detailing the allegations of sexual harassment. James' investigation brought down the governor less than a year after he won an Emmy Award for his famous...

__label__3 Andrew Cuomo To Resign After Investigation Finds He Sexually Harassed Multiple WomenNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced he will resign from office following a scathing report from the state's attorney general concluding that the third-term Democrat sexually harassed 11 women, and in one instance, sought to retaliate against one of his accusers who went public with her allegations. "Wasting energy on distractions is the last thing that state government should be doing, and I cannot be the cause of that," Cuomo, 63, said in remarks Tuesday from the state capital of Albany. "I think that, given the circumstances, the best...
__label__1 ‘Governments Are Spying on the People Who Bring Us the News’ANALYSISJanine Jackson interviewed Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Cindy Cohn about Pegasus spyware for the July 31, 2021 episode of CounterSpin. “We all rely on journalists’ ability to find out what’s going on, especially in ways that governments don’t like, to be an informed populace,” Cindy Cohn said. "I think it’s not an overstatement to say the question of self-governance turns on whether the current people in power can hide from us the truth about what’s going on in the world." "How do we elect the right people if the people in power right now are making...
__label__4 Facebook Whistleblower’s Push For Stricter Social Media Regulation Is Raising Free Speech ConcernsANALYSISFacebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified in front of a Senate Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to pass legislation regulating Facebook and pushing for more aggressive censorship of misleading content. Haugen, who was employed as a product manager on Facebook’s Civic Misinformation team, leaked internal documents published by The Wall Street Journal last month detailing Facebook’s business practices. The leaked documents showed that Facebook’s algorithms amplified incendiary and divisive content, as well as misleading information related to the COVID-19 vaccine. Haugen called to crack down on the amplification of “hateful” speech and...
__label__3 Fast facts on views of workplace harassment amid allegations against New York Gov. CuomoThis week, a report from the New York state attorney general alleged that Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, including current and former state employees, and violated state and federal law. The report’s release leaves Cuomo’s political future uncertain and is prompting a renewed conversation about workplace harassment and abuse in the United States. In early 2018, Pew Research Center conducted a survey on workplace sexual harassment and assault following the start of the #MeToo movement, when allegations against prominent men in entertainment, politics, the media and other industries sparked increased attention to those...
__label__2 Why Ron DeSantis is more dangerous than TrumpOPINIONThere should be a special place in hell — or potentially in prison — for politicians who put their political goals ahead of the health and safety of our children. That is exactly what Gov. Ron DeSantis is doing in Florida with the executive order he signed last Friday barring school districts from mandating that students and school employees wear masks during the spike in Covid cases. Beyond his potentially deadly decision about Florida schools, DeSantis poses a different, but familiar, danger to our country. As Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said Wednesday on...
__label__4 Facebook Whistleblower Claims Profit Was Prioritized Over Clamping Down on Hate SpeechA Facebook whistleblower, who is due to testify before Congress on Tuesday, has accused the Big Tech company of repeatedly putting profit before doing “what was good for the public,” including clamping down on hate speech. Frances Haugen, who told CBS’s “60 Minutes” program that she was recruited by Facebook as a product manager on the civic misinformation team in 2019, said she and her attorneys have filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. During her appearance on the television program on Sunday, Haugen revealed that she was...
__label__3 Cuomo Could Face Criminal Charges, Arrest If Investigation Backs Up Groping Allegations, Albany Sheriff SaysNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo could face criminal charges and arrest if an investigation into a criminal sexual complaint filed Thursday turns up evidence that substantiates the allegations, the county sheriff for the state capital said Saturday. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said his office is in the early stages of investigation, but that if charges were warranted the governor could be charged with “[a] misdemeanor, possibly a couple,” NBC’s New York affiliate reported. The investigation “could lead to an arrest,” Apple said, according to 1010 WINS news radio. The woman’s complaint...
__label__1 A Quick Reminder That Mandating Vaccines Is Totally ConstitutionalOPINIONAnti-vaxxers and anti-mask people are loud and wrong all the time. It’s a devastating combination. They’ve got an entire white-wing media echo-sphere that amplifies their wrong ideas. They have social media algorithms that elevate their ignorance and misinformation, such that even calling them out boosts their uninformed or willfully false takes. Moreover, the sheer breadth of things they are wrong about is dizzying. The vaccine has been blamed for everything from causing new Covid-19 variants (it doesn’t) to granting people the power to control metal, like Magneto (I wish). The...
__label__4 Facebook Smeared Me With Its ‘Fact-Checking.’ Now, I’m Suing the Tech Giant.OPINIONI just sued Facebook. I didn’t want to sue. I hate lawsuits. I tried for a year to reach someone at Facebook to fix things, but Facebook wouldn’t. Here’s the problem: Facebook uses “independent fact-checkers” to try to reduce fake news on its site. That’s a noble goal. Unfortunately, at least one Facebook “fact-checker” is a climate-alarmist group that cleverly uses its Facebook connections to stop debate. Facebook is a private company. It has every right to cut me off. But Facebook does not have the right to just lie...

What did you do when people were disillusioned?' Let New York's answer be that in that defining moment we brought healing and light and hope and progress and action.” In the wake of today’s damning 165-page report released by New York Attorney General Letitia James, Cuomo has the...
__label__2 Already Distorting Jan. 6, G.O.P. Now Concocts Entire CounternarrativeANALYSISIn the hours and days after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, rattled Republican lawmakers knew exactly who was to blame: Donald J. Trump. Loyal allies began turning on him. Top Republicans vowed to make a full break from his divisive tactics and dishonesties. Some even discussed removing him from office. By spring, however, after nearly 200 congressional Republicans had voted to clear Mr. Trump during a second impeachment proceeding, the conservative fringes of the party had already begun to rewrite history, describing the Capitol riot as a peaceful...

__label__3 Andrew Cuomo refuses to resign: "I never touched anyone inappropriately"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday that he will not resign from his post, despite an independent investigation finding that he sexually harassed multiple women in violation of federal and state law. Why it matters: Cuomo had previously urged those calling for his resignation — including nearly every prominent New York Democrat — to wait for the results of the investigation overseen by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The findings were damning, but Cuomo said he is not going anywhere. What they're saying: "My attorney, who is a non-political former federal prosecutor, has...

In Chelsea, people showed it to attend a John Mulaney stand-up set at City Winery. And in Troy, N.Y., patrons are using it to enter an intimate, speakeasy-style bar that only admits vaccinated guests. This magic ticket is New York State’s Excelsior Pass, which was introduced in March as the first and only government-issued vaccine passport in the country, accessible, for now, only to people who...
__label__5 'Domestic Terrorism' Fears Will Be Used To Justify Increased Snooping and HarassmentOPINIONAfter the pro-Trump demonstrations and breach of the Capitol on January 6, the Biden administration is promising a new era of FBI snooping, harassment, and provocateuring. FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in a statement released on Tuesday that his FBI "has surged resources to our domestic terrorism investigations in the last year, increasing personnel by 260 percent." Those remarks are bad news for anybody who is worried about federal overreach. The events of January 6, Wray said, prove "a willingness by some to...
__label__3 Biden backs taking sexual assault prosecutions away from U.S. military commandersPresident Joe Biden on Friday backed a recommendation that U.S. military prosecutions of sexual assaults be taken away from the chain of command and given to independent prosecutors to better serve the victims.The change recommended by an independent review commission would represent a major shift in how the military has handled sexual assaults and related crimes for decades. It comes several years after the advent of the #MeToo response to sexual assault, harassment and discrimination against women by men in various walks of life.
__label__1 Feds are tracking Americans' social media to identify dangerous conspiracies. Critics worry for civil liberties.Since 2018, at least three white supremacist mass shooters in America have referred to the “Great Replacement” theory, a conspiracy claim that white people are being replaced in the U.S. and elsewhere by immigrants of color.  That’s the narrative Robert Bowers alluded to on social media before killing 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. Patrick Crusius, who killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, less than a year later, was inspired by the racist trope. So was John Earnest, who killed one person...

Some inside and outside the ranks wonder if, on the issue of sexual assault, this has become a stumbling block to progress.

People with significant 401(k) holdings are going to owe the government a meaningful portion of their pile in taxes. In the process of calculating how large that tax burden might be, it was necessary to review the taxation of Social Security benefits. The taxation of benefits was introduced in the 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act.

__label__3 Pompeo urges future US foreign policy be made through 'filter' of China threatSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Trump would be remembered for jettisoning decades of wrongheaded bipartisan consensus on China, recalibrating U.S. policy to recognize Beijing as a belligerent regime intent on supplanting America as the preeminent superpower. In an interview to discuss his tenure as Trump’s top diplomat, Pompeo told the Washington Examiner that the United States is in a stronger position to counter China than four years ago because of key foreign policy decisions made by the outgoing president. Pompeo said Trump’s innovative strategy started with Washington’s crackdown...

Here are the quick facts to get you started:THE QUICK FACTSAs of 6pm EST on Sunday, March 15th, there were over 162,000 global confirmed cases of the Coronavirus, with over 6,000 deaths. (Source: Johns Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/)Governments and citizens across the world are working to combat the spread of the virus. Italy, the worst-hit country after China, reported 368 deaths in the last 24 hours and remains in total lockdown mode. Spain and France just announced nationwide lockdowns of their own. In the United States, schools across the country are closing doors, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to zero, and travelers returning home faced long lines due to travel restrictions.In China, the situation appears to be improving, with many attributing the declining number of new cases to strict containment and mitigation measures.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from United States to ChinaOur bitterly divided House has done the right thing to address the coronavirus crisisA coronavirus cautionary tale from Italy: Don’t do what we didSouth Korea: What We’re Doing to Fight the CoronavirusChina’s coronavirus response and Italy’s struggles show the benefits of a hierarchical system – and where it needs improvement
__label__5 US to declare ivory-billed woodpecker and 22 more species extinctThe ivory-billed woodpecker and 22 more birds, fish and other species are expected to be declared extinct by the US Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday. It’s a rare move for wildlife officials to give up hope on a plant or animal, but government scientists have exhausted efforts to find these 23 species and warned that the climate crisis, on top of other pressures, could make such disappearances more common. “Each of these 23 species represents a permanent loss to our nation’s natural heritage and to global biodiversity,” Bridget Fahey, who oversees...
__label__3 Assessing Trump's Experiment With Protectionist Trade PoliciesANALYSISWith President Donald Trump soon departing Washington, now is a great time to assess his protectionist trade policies. From tariffs to his hectic bullying of other governments to renegotiate trade agreements to his support for American export subsidies, the Trump years were more than infuriating on trade matters; they were destructive. This harsh conclusion is no surprise to those of us who understand international trade. We realized from the start that the president's trade philosophy is the mercantilist one that Adam Smith debunked nearly 250 years ago. For instance, Trump...

__label__4 The Science of How Wildfires Got So HellishANALYSISWildfire are normally a critical component of a healthy landscape, but these blazes are now metastasizing into monsters that obliterate ecosystems. A wildfire that would once chew through a few dozen acres of underbrush, making way for new plant growth, now burns with extreme ferocity, producing so much heat and smoke that it can generate its own thunderclouds, which light more fires. Huge fires now regularly blacken swaths of land: California’s Dixie Fire has burned 950 square miles over the past month, making it the second largest fire in state history—and it’s only 31...

But it was recently the backdrop, in the search for greener flying, to a strange and remarkable scene. “Anyone passing would have wondered why these people were staring at a pipe and whooping and laughing,” says Bobby Sethi, associate professor of gas turbine combustion at Cranfield University. “But we were almost certainly the only people in the world right then burning anything without producing CO2.” In...
__label__3 With Gas Prices Soaring, Biden Searches for a ScapegoatANALYSISPresident Biden has put climate policy at the center of his agenda. On his first day in office, he canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried more than 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada through the U.S. He also rejoined the Paris Agreement and has since dispatched regulatory agencies to cut off capital from the oil and gas sector. The results have been predictable: declining domestic oil production and rising gasoline prices. And now that the chickens are coming home to roost, Biden is...

__label__4 The U.N.’s Terrifying Climate ReportOPINIONIn 1988, the World Meteorological Organization teamed up with the United Nations Environment Programme to form a body with an even more cumbersome title, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or, as it quickly became known, the I.P.C.C. The I.P.C.C.’s structure was every bit as ungainly as its name. Any report that the group issued had to be approved not just by the researchers who collaborated on it but also by the governments of the member countries, which today number a hundred and ninety-five. The process seemed guaranteed to produce...
__label__3 Vaccine Mandate Threatens Major Trucking Disruption, Industry Insiders SayAmerican truckers don’t like taking orders. But the Biden administration has increased pressure on some of them to take the vaccine—willing or unwilling. All through the pandemic, truckers endured hardships to keep America’s infrastructure running. They waited in line for hours in sight of bathrooms they weren’t allowed to use. On the road, some died alone of COVID-19. Now, with supply chains disrupted, Americans need them more than ever. But faced with the prospect of mandated vaccination, many drivers are considering quitting. “I’d fight it,” said veteran trucker Mike Widdins,...

If that system collapses, it would lead to dramatic changes in worldwide weather patterns. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, transports warm, salty water from the tropics northward at the ocean surface and cold water southward at the ocean bottom. “The Atlantic Meridional Overturning really is one of our planet’s key circulation systems,” said the author of the...

Amid several global crises, including climate change and a pandemic, billionaires are spending their cash on launching themselves into space for fun. When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos told reporters after his first space tourism trip on Tuesday that Amazon customers and employees had “paid” for his flight, that only intensified that criticism. But critics won’t deter Bezos and the other superrich. Space tourism is now a reality for the people who can afford it — and it will have...

Starting Nov. 1, unvaccinated employees on Delta’s account-based healthcare plan will get hit with a $200 monthly surcharge.   It's a necessary policy, according to CEO Ed Bastian, who noted that the average hospital stay for COVID-19 costs the carrier about $50,000 per person.  "This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company," Bastian said in a memo to employees Wednesday.  Following the rise...

But US health officials and other scientists have vehemently disagreed, saying our current vaccines are holding up really well — at least so far. “Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,” reads an unusual joint statement from the FDA and the CDC that was released hours after...
__label__3 Infrastructure Bill May Violate Biden 'Red Line' With 'Per-Mile User Fee'Despite President Joe Biden's supposed "red line" on raising taxes for those making less than $400,000, the draft infrastructure bill in the Senate includes a "national motor vehicle per-mile user fee pilot" program. If that remained in the bill, it would take future legislation in order for Biden to keep his promise not to raise taxes on lower-income Americans, the Washington Examiner reported. White House officials had been adamant Biden will not support a gas tax or user fees like the mileage pilot program, but section 13002 of the 2,702-page initial...

The legislation, which has 61 Republican and 21 Democratic co-sponsors, aims...
__label__2 Next for South Koreans: reform the government that serves themIn 2013, Park Geun-hye was South Korea’s newly elected president, beating rival Moon Jae-in by a million votes. Four years later, Ms. Park is in jail, impeached and awaiting trial for charges that she abused power and demanded tens of thousands of dollars in bribes. That’s one outcome of a months-long corruption scandal that rocked South Korean society this year, feeding voters’ suspicions that the rich and powerful live by a different set of rules.
__label__4 Scientists Studying Temperature at Which Humans Spontaneously Die With Increasing UrgencyLast week’s historic heatwave saw portions of the Northwest breaking all-time temperature records and gearing up for wildfire risk. The temperatures are now being attributed to an excess of 100 deaths across the region as it gears up for another week of extreme highs. The heat can feel apocalyptic, and scientists are increasingly studying the heat and humidity conditions at which some humans suddenly die, a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common as a result of extreme weather driven by climate change. This is perhaps best illustrated in a study published last year in Science Advances, alarmingly titled "The...

That caught the attention of even the CIA, which documented the puzzling phenomenon in a secret assessment two days later, noting, according to since-declassified records, the "semicircular pool of bright light, red in the middle and white at the sides, then formed in this shroud" that would be visible from Finland to...

Liberty’s board also voted Friday to open an “independent and comprehensive review” of the school office tasked with handling discrimination and abuse.

The other side argues that by the very fact of their gender transition, trans girls and women have earned the right to compete as their chosen...

Soon after, she left the venue, accompanied by a medical official; when she returned, it was only to watch her teammates. All this happened early in the morning, US time.

The bipartisan framework announced Thursday isn’t causing us to change our mind. There is much to dislike about the so-called compromise proposal (even putting aside the minor detail that the nation’s infrastructure is not, in fact, in dire need of repair). The deal negotiated by a group of five Republicans and five Democrats would mean $579 billion in new spending that, when slapped on top of what the federal government is already slated to spend on infrastructure, could mean $1.2...

Bennett, who had served as a health policy adviser to the governor and endured verbal sexual harassment and intimidation, said in a statement that a refusal to impeach was “the coward’s way out.” There is indeed something particularly spineless to the way State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a longtime Cuomo ally, presented the decision to halt the impeachment.

Cinemark also emphasized its COVID-19 control measures, including elaborate yet generally pointless precautions such as seat wipes and frequent swabbing of surfaces. But the most appealing thing to me was a safeguard the chain has abandoned: Face masks are now "optional for fully vaccinated guests." While...

The big picture: Organizers had planned to allow venues to be filled up to 50% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 Japanese spectators and no overseas fans. A surge in COVID-19 cases and...
__label__4 The Democrats who could run to replace CuomoALBANY — While Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not thrown in the towel on his future yet, it’s probably a safe bet to assume he will not be elected to a fourth term in 2022. Despite the crescendo of calls for the New York governor to step down early, no Democrats have yet declared their intentions to run to succeed him. And there’s plenty of time for wild cards — perhaps a celebrity or billionaire will enter the primary and throw preexisting assumptions for a loop. But here are some of the officials...

__label__4 The court decision freeing Bill Cosby, explained as best we canANALYSISThe court decision freeing Bill Cosby is a train wreck. It’s also probably correct. Bill Cosby, the disgraced comedian who was convicted of sexual assault in 2018, is no longer in prison, due to a state supreme court decision in Commonwealth v. Cosby. The circumstances that freed him involve a stunning display of prosecutorial incompetence, a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court that split three ways on what should become of Cosby, and a long, rambling judicial opinion that is often difficult to parse. The thrust of that opinion is that, even though then-Montgomery County District...

__label__5 Top Pentagon officials open to limited change in the military justice system to address sexual assaultThe Defense Department's top leaders Thursday signaled an openness to remove prosecutorial decisions on sexual assault from the chain of command. But they voiced reservations about overhauling the military justice system for all serious crimes, as some senators are pushing in a recent bill.  The Defense Department's top officer, General Mark Milley, said he is open minded to "significant and fundamental change" in the area of sexual assault and harassment but would want to see "some detailed study" before changes to the military justice system are applied to all serious...

Jean CarrollIn a brief filed on Monday night, the Department of Justice argued that it should be allowed to swap itself out as the defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E.

Therefore, comments made on a personal matter — like denying a rape allegation by saying “she’s not my type” and “it never happened” — still allow Trump to be protected as an “employee of the...

__label__1 Kansas bill to ban trans athletes fails by one voteA Kansas bill banning transgender girls from playing women's sports failed Monday after the state Senate failed to override a veto from Gov.

The big picture: Nearly 90 bills targeting trans kids have been introduced by predominately Republican state legislatures this year, per ACLU data. Nine other bills across five states, mostly focused on health care, have...

Beijing’s latest tit-for-tat salvo, in retaliation for earlier sanctions imposed by Washington on officials from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) over Hong Kong, is likely to increase tensions between the two nations ahead of an upcoming visit by US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to Tianjin.

Seven new officials have joined the National Security Council’s Middle East team since Biden took office, officials familiar with the matter said. NSC spokesperson Emily Horne confirmed the appointments in an email response to Foreign Policy. They will report...

__label__3 How 31 Republicans Just Betrayed The Country To Reward Illegal Immigration, Worsen Inflation, And Pay Off Democrats’ DonorsOPINIONA vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill is a vote for Biden's reconciliation legislation -- the largest cradle-to-grave expansion of federal power since the New Deal. At nearly midnight on Friday, 13 House Republicans gave Speaker Nancy Pelosi the votes she needed to pass the so-called “bipartisan infrastructure bill” — colloquially known in DC as the BIF. In doing so, these House Republicans, among them two members of the House GOP leadership team, all but guaranteed House passage of Joe Biden’s hotly partisan, $2 trillion reconciliation bill, which represents the largest cradle-to-grave...
__label__2 Biden Can’t Claim ‘Moral Leadership’ While Sanctioning the ICCOPINIONIn his Feb. 4 foreign-policy address, U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to make human rights and multilateralism cornerstones of his approach to global affairs. But that’s a pledge he appears to have forgotten just a day later, on Feb. 5, when the pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has the authority to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the West Bank and Gaza Strip—by Israeli and Palestinian personnel alike. Biden’s State Department immediately criticized the court’s scrutiny of...

__label__3 Republicans Primed To ‘Comfortably Take Back’ Congress In 2022 After Democrats’ Election DisasterRepublicans’ routing of Democrats in Virginia and their strong showing in New Jersey on Tuesday night may signal a GOP takeover of Congress next year. In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin knocked off Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor, upsetting the former governor of Virginia who was an early favorite to retake the office. Youngkin’s victory was joined by Republican Winsome Sears, who defeated Democrat Hala Ayala for lieutenant governor, and Republican Jason Miyares, who upset incumbent Democrat Mark Herring for attorney general. In New Jersey, GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is running neck-and-neck with Democratic...
__label__2 Biden team considering a halt to 'offensive' arms sales for SaudisPresident Joe Biden’s administration is considering the cancellation of arms deals with Saudi Arabia that pose human rights concerns while limiting future military sales to “defensive” weapons, as it reassesses it relationship with the kingdom. Four sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said that after pausing half a billion dollars in arms deals with Saudi Arabia out of concern over casualties in Yemen earlier this year, officials are assessing the equipment and training included in recent sales to determine what can be considered defensive. Those deals would be allowed. A...
__label__4 OPINION: Democrats: Do not help Republicans carry out their sneaky anti-Social Security agendaOPINIONThe Republican plot to slash Social Security has moved to the Senate. After House Republicans changed the rules to ensure that the disability side of the program (SSDI) will run out of cash in late 2016, it was the Senate GOP's turn to bash the program in a Budget Committee hearing.
__label__3 Bernie Sanders Urges House Democrats to Hold Infrastructure Bill Hostage Until Reconciliation Package PassesJoining Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the “squad,” Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday urged his fellow Democrats in the House to vote against the bipartisan infrastructure bill when it comes to the floor for a vote on Thursday unless Congress first passes the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package.“I strongly urge my House colleagues to vote against the bipartisan infrastructure bill until Congress passes a strong reconciliation bill,” Sanders tweeted Tuesday.
__label__2 U.S. Ready To Talk With Iran On Nuclear DealThe United States said on Thursday it was ready to restart diplomacy with Tehran around a nuclear deal sealed between Iran and world powers, but which the Trump administration had abandoned in 2018."The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran's nuclear program," State Department spokesman Ned Price said, referring to the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members and Germany.
__label__4 To Win Back Older Voters, Democrats Talk Up Medicare and Social SecurityDemocrats are stepping up their appeals to older voters in the final stretch before the midterm elections, spurred by polls showing the party has regained some support lost in the Obama years. The question is whether they can narrow the gap with Republicans enough to offset their broader disadvantages given widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama. Both parties covet voters 65 and older because that group tends to make up a disproportionately large share of the midterm electorate. Democrats long had an edge, until less-supportive baby boomers aged and began replacing...
__label__3 Senate Rules Didn’t Dash Dems’ Mass Amnesty, They Did (But Amnesty Might Still Survive)ANALYSISThe sweeping change would grant permanent status and legal residency to an estimated 8 million people at a cost estimated at $140 billion. The Senate’s parliamentarian appeared to dash Democrats’ mass amnesty dreams Sunday, issuing an opinion that the rules for a budget reconciliation bill — a privileged legislative vehicle that can be passed with a simple majority — don’t encompass providing permanent legal status to millions of illegal migrants. Democratic leadership claimed they “are deeply disappointed,” but they know decision doesn’t matter, at least not as much as they’d like to...
__label__1 Biden announces sanctions against military leaders involved in Myanmar coupPresident Biden on Wednesday announced a series of steps in response to last week's military coup in Myanmar, including withholding "$1 billion in Burmese government funds" held in the U.S. and imposing sanctions against the military leaders behind the coup. The big picture: These are the first sanctions announced by the Biden administration and are part of the president's efforts to re-emphasize democracy and human rights in American foreign policy. The backstory: The coup came after Myanmar's ruling party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide election victory...

__label__3 Last-minute partisan disputes threaten infrastructure accordA long-sought bipartisan infrastructure deal lawmakers hoped to secure Monday could collapse because of a sudden dispute over the terms of the package that has left Republicans and the White House blaming each other. A group of Senate Republicans had hoped to announce a finalized agreement on Monday on a measure that would spend $1.2 trillion on roads, bridges, water projects, and broadband expansion. But Republicans now say the White House and Democrats are pushing for late changes to the measure that could sink the deal. Democrats say it’s the other...

__label__3 It’s Time to Make the House BiggerOPINIONGeorge Washington had an uncanny knack for getting things right at the last minute. As general of the Continental Army, Washington defused a conspiracy within his officer corps to revolt at the tail end of the Revolutionary War in the spring of 1783. Such a military revolt could have snuffed out American democracy in its infancy. In his old age, Washington, who had owned slaves since he was a young boy, ensured that all of his slaves would be freed upon his wife Martha’s death through his will.
__label__2 Pompeo Declares China’s Crackdown on Uighurs ‘Genocide’With less than 24 hours left in office, the Trump administration on Tuesday declared that China’s violent repression against its Uighur population constituted a genocide, following widespread condemnation of the Chinese government’s campaign of mass internment, forced labor, forced sterilization, and other human rights violations against more than 1 million Muslim minorities. The move follows four years of growing tensions between the United States and China, as outgoing Trump administration officials describe Beijing as the biggest threat to U.S. national security in the coming century. It also represents a significant...

__label__2 Capitol Riot Optics Among Reasons Why Two High Profile State Department Trips CanceledThe abrupt cancelation of all State Department travel this week has upended two high-profile trips — a precedent-breaking visit to Taiwan by Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and a final visit to Europe by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Ambassador Craft was due to arrive in Taiwan Wednesday on a three-day visit that included meetings with President Tsai Ing-wen and other senior officials. Chinese officials had demanded the cancelation of the trip, which would have ended Washington’s self-imposed ban on such high-level contacts with the self-governing...

The group never heard back from the...

The dissent cable is the second such cable sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week, reflecting widespread shock and anger in the diplomatic corps at Trump’s actions and Pompeo’s own response to the political crisis. The protest against the sitting U.S. president by...

Today, South Korea has fewer than 300, and the U.S. has more than 70,000. On February 16, a Sunday, a 61-year-old woman with a fever entered the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, South Korea. She touched her finger to a digital scanner. She passed through a pair of glass doors and proceeded downstairs, to the prayer hall, where she sat with approximately 1,000 other worshippers in a large windowless room. Hours later, she exited...
__label__3 Desperate for a deal, lawmakers announce police reform 'framework'A small group of lawmakers issued a statement declaring “an agreement on a framework” for police reform, meeting a self-imposed deadline to accomplish something before the Senate adjourned for two weeks. But the agreement announced Thursday by Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat; Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; and Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, appears far from final or detailed enough to address whether the kind of comprehensive police reform many lawmakers want will ever pass Congress. “There is still more work to be done on the...
__label__2 Defense In DepthOPINIONWhy U.S. Security Depends on Alliances—Now More Than Ever By Kori Schake, Jim Mattis, Jim Ellis, and Joe Felter The world is not getting safer, for the United States or for U.S. interests. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the 2017 National Defense Strategy described an international environment of increased global disorder, long-term strategic competition, rapid dispersion of technologies, and eroding U.S. military advantages. Protecting the United States requires a strategy of defense in depth—that is, of identifying and dealing with global problems where they occur rather than waiting for...
__label__4 U.S. officials say Kim Jong Un of North Korea may be ill after surgery, but South Korea casts doubtThe South Korean government cast doubt Tuesday on rumors that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un was gravely ill, but U.S. officials said he may be incapacitated after heart surgery. Speculation about Kim's health has mounted after he failed to attend his late grandfather's birthday celebrations on April 15, the most important date in North Korea's calendar, known as "Day of the Sun." The rumors accelerated Tuesday when the South Korean website Daily NK cited one unnamed source as saying Kim, who is believed to be 36, had undergone heart...
__label__3 House Republicans Grow Midterm Cash Advantage Over DemsThe House Republican fundraising arm outraised its Democratic counterpart in May, according to figures shared by the organizations. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised over $14 million last month, its third straight record-breaking month for fundraising, the group says. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the same month brought in just under $10 million. The May fundraising hauls bring the NRCC's cash on hand to $42.1 million, topping the DCCC's cash reserves by $6 million. Both groups have scored record fundraising numbers this year. The DCCC narrowly outraised the NRCC in April, but a $5...
__label__1 Under Biden, State Department needs to be rebuilt. But better.ANALYSISOver recent years, “build back better” has become the mantra of reconstruction teams looking to rebuild communities devastated by natural disasters, from earthquakes to hurricanes, but in smarter, more sustainable ways. Now the transition team for President-elect Joe Biden is applying the guiding slogan of disaster recovery, which he employed during his campaign in reference to the entire United States economy, to the rebuilding of federal government agencies and departments. And, say U.S. diplomats, former ambassadors, and foreign policy experts, perhaps in no case is the “rebuild, but better” concept...

Most businesses were shut down or crippled, and more than 10 million people had filed for unemployment in two weeks. In contrast, South Korea on April 2 had fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases and 169 deaths. The disease rate there appears to be both low and stable, yet no South Korean city has gone under a full lockdown, and the main economic...
__label__3 Senate Republicans Introduce Bill Requiring Congressional Approval for New Iran DealSenate Republicans proposed legislation Friday that would require President Joe Biden to secure congressional approval before a new nuclear deal is forged with Iran. The bill stipulates that any agreement arrived at with the help of the Biden administration must be deemed a treaty and therefore receive Senate approval in accordance with the Constitution, according to a copy obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson and 21 other Republicans, the legislation would add an additional check against Biden’s executive foreign-policy-making with the Iranian regime.
__label__1 Pompeo to make unprecedented visit to West Bank settlementSecretary of State Mike Pompeo is planning to visit the Golan Heights and an Israeli settlement in the West Bank next week, both firsts for a U.S. secretary of state.Why it matters: Since 1967, all previous U.S. administrations have treated the West Bank and Golan Heights as occupied territory.The big picture: The trip seems intended to highlight the Trump administration's policy shifts on Israel. For Pompeo, it also has domestic political significance ahead of a possible presidential run in 2024.
__label__4 South Korea shows that democracies can succeed against the coronavirusSome commentators are arguing that China’s coronavirus response attests to the superiority of its authoritarian brand of governance and crisis management. In reality, it turns out that democracies are better suited to protect public health — at least, when they take advantage of their inherent strengths. One country is showing how it’s done: South Korea. “The advantages of the Chinese system have once again been demonstrated,” the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship paper said in a recent commentary — one that was approvingly quoted in the Wall Street Journal: “China’s battle...

On Wednesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen about whether this policy is unconstitutional. New York is one of only six states (the others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey) that condition the right to bear arms on an official’s discretion, which is...
__label__1 Trump Moves Closer to Renewing Nuclear Treaty With RussiaThe United States and Russia appear to be closer to clinching a deal to extend the Barack Obama-era New START arms control treaty, after Russian negotiators publicly conceded to a freeze on the number of nuclear warheads in exchange for a one-year extension of the agreement, according to new statements from U.S. and Russian officials.  The Wall Street Journal first reported that the Trump administration was near a deal with Russian negotiators, something that U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for ahead of the November election despite calls within...

You see ‘em? And the winner is…a movie from South Korea. What the hell is that about?” bellowed a rather clammy Trump. “Was it good? I don’t know. I’m looking for like, let’s get Gone with the Wind.

__label__3 Why Didn't COVID-19 Kill the Constitution?ANALYSISWe can thank judges who were prepared to enforce constitutional limits on public health powers. The day after the nation's first COVID-19 lockdown took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would never impose similar restrictions. Telling residents they may not leave their homes except for "essential" purposes "scares people," the Democratic governor told The New York Times on March 18, 2020, and "the fear, the panic, is a bigger problem than the virus." Cuomo unequivocally ruled out a stay-at-home order in New York. "That is...
__label__1 Threat to evacuate U.S. diplomats from Iraq raises fear of warWashington has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone. Any move by the United States to reduce its diplomatic presence in a country where it has up to 5,000 troops would be widely seen in the region as an escalation of its confrontation with Iran, which Washington blames for missile and bomb attacks. That in turn would open the possibility of military...
__label__5 South Korea signs defense agreement with China after Trump's negotiators walk out on US-Korea talksAlthough Donald Trump is currently the target of an impeachment inquiry for tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine to a demand that the nation "investigate" his political opponents, he remains in control of U.S. foreign policy. That means he retains the ability to undo decades of international policy on a whim, an ability he continues to use with reckless abandon. In the latest souring of relations between the United States and South Korea, the two nations have suspended diplomatic negotiations on how to share costs for the U.S. troop presence...
__label__3 Top Trump allies begin legal effort to stop federal government from trampling on constitutional rightsAllies of former President Donald Trump are launching a legal team whose mission is to stop "big tech, big media and big government" from trampling on the rights of Americans.

It "is another strong addition to AFPI’s already impressive arsenal of weapons against these assaults on our freedoms," institute President and CEO Brooke Rollins told the Washington Examiner.

What they're saying:...

Speaking to reporters about anti-Asian attacks that have occurred around the country, the mayor encouraged people who have “witnessed or experienced any act of hate” to report it. “Even if something is not a criminal case,”...

The projectiles reportedly flew around 267 miles and were fired from the Wonsan area on North Korea’s eastern coast. “Our military, in preparation for additional launches, is maintaining (its) readiness posture by monitoring related movements,” an official in the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff office told CNN. This is the first projectile the country has fired since May when North Korea tested short-range missiles and other rockets. President Trump became the...

In a marathon three hours of oral arguments today, the United States Supreme Court continued its rapid handling of a controversial Texas law that effectively outlaws abortion in the state. The constitutional right to abortion is not at issue, but two cases brought in front of the court at breakneck speed still raise significant questions about...

The mob breached the building and forced lawmakers to evacuate, and five people died in the ensuing riot and its aftermath.
__label__2 Sotomayor: SCOTUS oral arguments changed in part because female justices were interruptedSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday that changes in the format of oral arguments were made in part after research showed that female justices were interrupted more by male justices and advocates, CNN reports. Driving the news: Sotomayor said the studies, including one published in 2017, have had an "enormous impact" and caused Chief Justice John Roberts to be "much more sensitive" to people being interrupted on the court, per CNN. "Most of the time women say things and they are not heard in the same way as men who might say the...

It’s really that simple. That’s what the tantrum over Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation is all about. The notion that the same Democrats who shelved the judicial filibuster and now threaten to destroy the separation of powers with a Court-packing revenge scheme — the same people, incidentally, so fond of smear-drenched confirmation hearings — are sticklers for process or decorum is simply ludicrous. For one thing, no norms have been undone by...
__label__2 The one case that could define the Supreme Court’s term – and legacyIs the law really the law, if change in personnel results in dramatic change? That’s the question Americans are grappling with as a momentous Supreme Court term opens this week. Justice Clarence Thomas, now the most senior member of the United States Supreme Court, admits he’s never been one to regularly hype the court.  “I’m quite content not to get out on the road,” he said last month, recalling a conversation years ago when his late colleague Justice Antonin Scalia encouraged him to get out “and fly the flag.” It...

There is no shortage of polls or pundits predicting the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But “outcomes” include more than simply election results. Who is gaming out how America — and the world — will respond? We are. While national polls suggest an edge for former Vice President Joe Biden, the winner isn’t determined by national polls. It is determined by who...

Progressives Eye Legislation After SCOTUS RulingHouse progressives are now eyeing legislation to reinstate the federal eviction moratorium after the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's ban. Representative Cori Bush, who slept outside on the U.S. Capitol for several nights in order to push officials to extend the moratorium past its July 30 expiration, said Thursday that lawmakers must take action to protect tenants.

__label__1 Supreme Court Blocks Biden Administration’s New Eviction MoratoriumThe Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the latest federal ban on evictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, siding with landlords against a moratorium the Biden administration imposed this month despite questions about its legality. Three liberal justices dissented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly renewed the eviction moratorium for millions of tenants affected by the pandemic, in large part to allow them to remain in their homes as state and local governments struggle to disburse some $47 billion of rental assistance provided by Congress. The current order was set to expire Oct. 3;...

__label__3 How ‘Weaponizing’ Mail-In Ballots Could Create Constitutional CrisisThe ongoing process of “weaponizing and abusing mail-in voting” could lead to an “unprecedented constitutional crisis” because of lack of reliability and the potential for fraud, a new report from two House Republicans contends.  Earlier this year, all mail-in balloting in a Democratic primary for a House seat in New York led to six weeks of dispute before a winner was determined. In another case, officials rejected 1 in 5 ballots as fraudulent in a Paterson, New Jersey, election.  “This expansive and late shift to all-mail voting will...
__label__2 The Supreme Court Injects Partisan Politics Into Independent AgenciesIf you think that government experts should be free from political influence, then think again. Twice this June the Supreme Court ruled that the president could exert more control over regulatory agencies, the government institutions that are as important as they sound boring. While Congress may write laws, agencies are needed to interpret them, apply them, and fill in their gaps. Take the government's efforts to address lead poisoning. Congress passed a statute in 1971, and since then, a suite of agencies has issued regulations that keep up with the...

__label__3 A Free America Is Never About ComfortOPINIONAs the parent of two daughters who are entering adulthood, my family has operated on a time-tested strategy that’s completely counter-intuitive to everything in my nature, yet is something I learned in high school biology many years ago. A butterfly only survives by struggling to exit its cocoon. If any aid is granted — for example if you break a cocoon to help the butterfly escape — its wings will not have developed the strength to fly. Ultimately the butterfly will die. The translation to parenting is this: as much...
__label__2 How conservative is the new Supreme Court majority, really?The Supreme Court began its summer recess last week, bringing an end to a term that served as the first test of its new 6-3 conservative majority, with all three of former President Donald Trump's appointees on the bench. During Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the final weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Democrats warned — and some Republicans hoped — that a court dominated by conservatives would be primed to radically rewrite the nation’s laws on a host of major issues through...

__label__3 Trump Proposes Election 'Delay': Here's What the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution SaysPresident Trump is making headlines with a morning tweet in which he questioned whether the US should consider delaying the November presidential election due to voter fraud concerns."With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"
__label__2 What's Next For Voting Rights After The Supreme Court's DecisionThe U.S. Supreme Court decided a major case on voting rights that essentially gutted what's left of the Voting Rights Act. The court upheld two Arizona laws — one of which banned the collection of absentee ballots by anyone other than a relative or caregiver, otherwise known as "ballot harvesting"; the other threw out any ballots cast in the wrong precinct. "Obviously, the Supreme Court accepted our test and our reasoning and rejected the Democratic National Committee's attempt to micromanage state elections," Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said on NPR's All Things Considered Thursday....

__label__2 Supreme Court strikes down disclosure rules for political donorsThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a California law that required nonprofits to hand over a list of their biggest donors. Why it matters: Some campaign-finance advocates have feared the court will begin chipping away at disclosure rules more broadly, making it harder and harder to figure out who’s funding major political causes. The big picture: In a 6-3 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said California had subjected donors to the threat of public harassment and intimidation, undermining their First Amendment right to free association. Background: California requires nonprofit organizations...

Chad McMahan) claim that it is illegal for businesses not to accept cash payments for goods or services. The posts further claim that when cash is turned down, the debt is legally recognized as paid. These posts come at a time when some businesses are refusing cash payments due to concerns about coronavirus transmission.

__label__1 U.S. unveils roadmap for net-zero aviation emissions by 2050The Transportation Department is unveiling a multi-agency roadmap to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector with a target of reaching net-zero by 2050. Why it matters: Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, but has other warming impacts too. It accounts for 11% of U.S. transportation-related emissions, according to the White House. Those emissions are projected to rise a lot in coming decades alongside the growth of air travel, absent aggressive adoption of climate-friendly tech. In a hypothetical case of technology frozen in place, the strategy...

__label__2 World headed for 2.4C warming despite climate summit - reportDespite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows. It calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to. COP26 "has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.

__label__2 The magic 1.5: What’s behind climate talks’ key elusive goalANALYSISOne phrase, really just a number, dominates climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland: The magic and elusive 1.5. That stands for the international goal of trying to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s a somewhat confusing number in some ways that wasn’t a major part of negotiations just seven years ago and was a political suggestion that later proved to be incredibly important scientifically. Stopping warming at 1.5 or so can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms...

Core parts of President Joe Biden’s climate plan have crumbled in the face of Washington political realities. This month, the lack of one key Senate vote in his own party forced the president to scrap a clean electricity proposal that supporters had described as essential for lowering the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Now that same lawmaker, Sen.

Under the pretense of sharing funny videos and embracing a boys-will-be-boys mentality, Barstool has successfully normalized a culture of harassment, misogyny, and rampant misinformation, all while taking cavalier attitudes toward the chaos that ensues.

__label__2 Does nuclear power have a place in a green-energy future?Countries around the world have set ambitious goals to fight climate change by drastically reducing their emissions in the coming decades. Doing so means replacing carbon-heavy power sources, like coal and gas, with green-energy solutions. Renewables like solar, wind and hydroelectric power will certainly play a major role. But environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers are divided on whether or not nuclear power should be part of a clean-energy future. In the 1980s, nuclear power provided about 17 percent of the world’s energy. But high-profile disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl led many countries to stop investing...

To close the gap, annual investment for the rest of this decade needs to be three times higher than it was in 2021. The size of this gap has two important implications.

__label__3 Department of Defense, military personnel now subject to automated 'continuous vetting' programThe vetting process for military and Department of Defense personnel is now "continuous" as it applies to checks for security clearance approval. The building of this effort is mostly waiting on the computer hardware side to fully catch up. Official lingo from the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) shortens "continuous vetting" to CV in their promotional material. It’s there the public learns that the Trusted Workforce 2.0 program intended to carry this CV process out was first launched in March 2018. It has been under development since then, with the...
__label__2 China vows end to building coal-fired power plants abroadChinese President Xi Jinping told the UN General Assembly Tuesday that his country "will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad" and plans to boost support for clean energy in developing nations. Why it matters: The pledge, if maintained, would mark a breakthrough in efforts to transition global power away from the most carbon-emitting fuel. Nations, including the U.S., have been urging China — historically a key source of coal-plant finance — to make such a commitment. Xi's pledge on coal financing comes just weeks before a critical UN climate summit....
__label__4 Did Michael Phelps Test Positive for Marijuana and Still Compete in Olympics?FACT CHECKIn July 2021, American track and field star Sha’Carri Richardson was suspended for one month and disqualified from the 2021 Olympic Games after she tested positive for THC, a psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. While many social media users criticized the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for even testing for a drug that is now legal in many states and is being used as medication with increased frequency, others drew a comparison between Richardson and another Olympic athlete, Michael Phelps, who was supposedly allowed to compete despite also testing positive for marijuana. But Phelps did not...
__label__2 Biden Admits to Supreme Court: The ‘Forever War’ Is Not Over, After AllOPINIONTo the extent President Biden’s pull-out from Afghanistan was not criminally negligent, it was pervasively mendacious. There was the president’s lamebrained targeting of September 11 as the withdrawal deadline — a strategic and propaganda boon for the Taliban. There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan...
__label__1 In Response to Climate Change, Citizens in Advanced Economies Are Willing To Alter How They Live and WorkA new Pew Research Center survey in 17 advanced economies spanning North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region finds widespread concern about the personal impact of global climate change. Most citizens say they are willing to change how they live and work at least some to combat the effects of global warming, but whether their efforts will make an impact is unclear. Citizens offer mixed reviews of how their societies have responded to climate change, and many question the efficacy of international efforts to stave off a global environmental crisis....

Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army several days before the November 2020 election and two days after the Capitol breach on Jan. 6 to reassure the Chinese army that an attack isn’t incoming, according to excerpts of a book that was published this week. Milley, the top U.S. general, described the two phone...

Excerpts: So, alongside the billions for bombs went hundreds of millions for gender studies in Afghanistan. According to US government reports, $787 million was spent on gender programs in Afghanistan, but that substantially understates the actual total, since gender goals were folded into practically every undertaking...
__label__2 Should Democrats have embraced the billionaire tax?As congressional Democrats ironed out the details of their ambitious social spending and infrastructure package, the lawmakers considered a novel proposal for paying for it: a billionaire tax. But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans. Under current law, assets like stocks are subject to...

The 21-year-old, sporting bright orange hair and an electric personality, roared to victory in the women’s 100-meter sprint at the U.S. Olympic trials, making her a fan favorite as well as a favorite to win gold. The positive test taken at the trials last month means Richardson will likely face a competition ban of some length; the sanction for...

__label__1 Democrats' billionaires tax explainedANALYSISThere is now legislative language behind the push to tax American billionaires on unrealized capital gains, as Sen. Ron Wyden last night released his 107-page plan. Why it matters: This would be a sea change in U.S. tax policy, which has only applied to realized gains (otherwise known as income). Wyden's proposal would apply to those with more than $1 billion in assets or more than $100 million in adjusted gross income over three consecutive years. The biggest tax bills would come up front, charging a long-term cap gains rates on all...

The so-called billionaires tax, announced by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, is part of a two-pronged legislative strategy that also includes a proposed 15% corporate minimum tax on the most profitable U.S. corporations, which was unveiled on Tuesday. Wyden and other lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, say the legislation is intended to curtail...

__label__2 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...
__label__5 Was the State Department Charging Americans $2K for Flights out of Afghanistan?FACT CHECKClaim: Per an Aug. 14, 2021 notice, the State Department was charging $2,000 or more for repatriation flights for U.S. citizens from Kabul airport after the Taliban takeover.Rating: TrueContext: After news of the costs of repatriation flights gained traction online resulting in outrage, the State Department changed the rule, saying they would no longer be charging citizens for the cost of taking a charter flight out of Afghanistan.

__label__3 Intel Agencies Warned of Afghan Collapse as Biden Publicly Downplayed PossibilityU.S. intelligence agencies warned of the collapse of the Afghan military and government at the hands of a resurgent Taliban over the summer, as President Biden publicly downplayed the possibility of a government rout. While Biden assured Americans on July 8 that the Afghan regime’s disintegration was far from inevitable, quieting fears of a “Saigon-like” foreign policy fiasco, previous intelligence reports indicated that Afghan security forces as well as the seat of government in Kabul were weakening and could falter, current and former American government officials told the New York Times.

Mr. Biden is expected to announce the symbolic designation on Saturday, the 106th anniversary of the beginning of what historians call a yearslong and systematic death march that the predecessors...
__label__3 Pentagon Refuses To Answer Question On Taliban Obtaining US Weaponry, EquipmentThe Department of Defense evaded a question about whether it is acting to prevent the Taliban from obtaining U.S. weapons in Afghanistan. A top U.S. military official said he doesn’t “have information” about an effort to seize military equipment the U.S. gave to the fallen Afghanistan government and has since been taken by Taliban insurgents, during a press briefing Monday.

You could get one of four kinds of letters: CP 11, CP 12, CP 13, or letter 6470. None of them is likely to contain good news. The Taxpayer Advocate Service says 9 million Americans have gotten notices from the IRS that say the government is billing them for payment due to a “math error.” 7.4 million of the errors were due to pandemic-era stimulus overpayments. But wait, there’s more. Financial experts...

Here’s how they do itThe wealthiest Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in income taxes every year, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and many leverage tax laws to do it legally, financial experts say. Although U.S. levies increase with income, the ultra-wealthy often finesse the tax code to reduce how much they owe. And some billionaires, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, pay little to no taxes compared to their wealth, a ProPublica report found.  “As long as you’re adhering to the law, everything’s fair game,” said certified...

The international, coordinated sanctions, first reported by POLITICO, drew condemnation and some immediate retaliatory sanctions from Beijing.

Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who announces his candidacy Monday—have one big thing in common: Each rose to power with support from the tea-party movement.Now the three, who all beat establishment-backed candidates in Senate primaries, will be competing for the loyalty of tea-party voters as they seek the GOP presidential nomination.
__label__4 Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, Said There Will Be a 'Smooth Transition' to a Trump Second TermSecretary of State Mike Pompeo just became the latest high-ranking Republican official to insist, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, that President Trump didn’t actually lose the 2020 election. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Pompeo said in  a briefing on Tuesday. Pompeo’s wild-eyed departure from reality comes as Trump continues to insist that Biden’s victory depends on widespread fraud, a claim that so far has not been borne out by any legitimate source.
__label__3 On Memorial Day, Remember Skepticism Toward a Large, Standing MilitaryOPINIONIn recent years, it's become common to thank both retired and active-duty military personnel for their service – an expression met with various measures of appreciation or discomfort by recipients. The new custom is a step beyond the long-established sentiments embodied by Memorial Day, which acknowledges those who fell in combat in the ranks of a rare American institution that retains wide public confidence. While the thank-yous are well-intentioned, they represent a shift in attitude for a country that once distrusted anything resembling a powerful military. They also gloss over the costs—acknowledged on...

__label__3 Veterans Rip Kamala Harris for Tone Deaf Memorial Day Weekend TweetVeterans ripped Vice President Kamala Harris for her Memorial Day weekend tweet that made no mention of the purpose of Memorial Day, which is to honor those who died fighting for the nation. “Enjoy the long weekend,” Harris tweeted from her official account, along with a close-up photo of herself.  Veterans lambasted the tweet immediately. Marine Corps veteran and Fox News contributor Joey Jones responded to Harris with a picture of himself in front of a wall of fallen troops. Jones, a double amputee, tweeted: “hey @KamalaHarris my buddies wanted...

__label__4 No One Is Prepared for the New GerrymandersOPINIONToward the end of the last decade, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices effectively abolished constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering. But don’t worry about it, Chief Justice John Roberts told the country: You, the citizens, can fix this problem yourselves! States “are actively addressing the issue on a number of fronts,” Roberts promised, and Congress isn’t far behind. “The avenue for reform established by the Framers,” he assured readers, “and used by Congress in the past, remains open.” Two years later, this passage reads like a twisted joke....
__label__3 Veterans Speak About Memorial Day: ‘It’s Not About Us’On Monday, May 31, Americans from sea to shining sea will observe Memorial Day. However, veterans are quick to remind you: “It’s not about us.” “Monday is not about us,” Sergeant J.O. Batten, Commander of VFW Post 8713 in Brooksville, Florida told The Epoch Times. “It’s about the men on that wall out there. A lot of people don’t realize that.” Batten, a United States Marine, served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. “The wall” is a granite monument, which stands guard at the front door of VFW.

__label__1 Boehner Fights Back Against Tea Party, AgainA high-stakes drama played out over the debt ceiling on Capitol Hill this week. It ended with President Obama getting exactly what he'd asked for — an extension of the Treasury's borrowing authority with no strings attached — and an even wider gulf between GOP congressional leaders and Tea Party-aligned conservatives. Underlying the Republican rift was House Speaker John Boehner's determination to avoid another episode like last fall's government shutdown. Boehner initially tried adding one sweetener after another to a debt limit extension, but none managed to get enough fellow...
__label__4 The NRA had a very good day in the Supreme CourtOPINIONThe biggest surprise in Wednesday morning’s arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. (NYSRPA) v. Bruen, a major Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court, is that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared open to many of New York state’s arguments defending its restrictions on where individuals may carry a gun. Even if Barrett does side with New York, however, her vote is unlikely to matter. Four justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — left little doubt that they will read the Second...
__label__3 Veterans Affairs hiring racial diversity consultants to fight homelessnessAmid a worrying rise in the number of homeless veterans, the Veterans Health Administration is seeking to hire racial diversity consultants to help "transform" its homeless programs "into a racially equitable and just organization.""Creating racially equitable systems demands that systems not simply be diverse, but that they be explicitly anti-racist," the VHA's Homeless Programs Office (HPO) said in a contract opportunity document.
__label__1 U.S. Senate bill would limit big tech mergersTwo U.S. senators have introduced bipartisan legislation that seeks to make it harder for Amazon.com and other tech giants to make acquisitions. The office of Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, said on Friday that she and Republican Tom Cotton had introduced a bill targeting such companies as Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. The bill would make it easier for the government to stop deals it believes break antitrust law by requiring the companies to prove to a judge that the deals are good...
__label__5 Majority of Supreme Court appears to think N.Y. gun law is too restrictiveA majority of Supreme Court justices indicated Wednesday that they believe Americans generally have a right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense and that a New York law requiring special justification for getting such a permit is too restrictive. But it was unclear from a two-hour argument in the case how much more the court was willing to do to clarify the Second Amendment. Several expressed concern about allowing those with concealed weapons in sensitive areas, such as stadiums, crowded public events or places were alcohol is...

__label__4 The Supreme Court Won’t Halt Texas’s Abortion Ban While The Justices Decide If Anyone Can SueThe US Supreme Court will allow Texas’s six-week abortion ban to remain in effect for now, with a majority of the justices rejecting the Justice Department’s push to immediately pause enforcement of the law while constitutional challenges work through the lower courts. The order, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from, leaves intact a decision earlier this month by a federal appeals court that revived the law, SB 8, two days after a judge in Austin blocked it. It means that healthcare providers in Texas will remain barred from performing nearly all...

Though the Court’s decision in Rivas-Villegas v.

Thanks to recent reporting by The Wall Street Journal, we now know how bad financial conflicts of interest are in the federal judiciary. According to the newspaper’s report, 131 federal judges broke the law by participating in 685 cases in which they had a financial interest, chiefly because of their holdings in individual stocks. This is a violation of the disqualification statute for United States judges prohibiting them from deciding...
__label__3 'Lay down your arms': Prominent veterans urge troops to defy TrumpPresident Trump’s idea to deploy active-duty military forces to quell increasingly violent riots in cities across the country has already sparked a sharp legal and constitutional clash. But an even more explosive debate has broken out on a question once believed unthinkable: Should — and will — rank-and-file troops obey the commander in chief if they’re ordered to round up American citizens on the streets of New York, Louisville, or Chicago? Some prominent veterans and lawmakers on Capitol Hill already are calling on service members to “lay down your arms”...

Zubaydah, which the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday, is a case about a man who was tortured by the CIA over an intelligence failure. It’s also a case about one of the US intelligence community’s worst-kept secrets. Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn (often referred to as “Abu Zubaydah”) is a Palestinian man who is currently held at the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After he was captured in Pakistan in 2002,...

These appear to show the company has been well aware...
__label__4 Back on the Bench, the Supreme Court Faces a Blockbuster TermA transformed Supreme Court returns to the bench on Monday to start a momentous term in which it will consider eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, vastly expanding gun rights and further chipping away at the wall separating church and state. The abortion case, a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks, has attracted the most attention. The court, now dominated by six Republican appointees, seems poised to use it to undermine and perhaps overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to...
__label__3 VFW Demands Trump Apology for Comment on Troops' Head InjuriesA veterans group is demanding an apology from President Donald Trump for remarks that it insists “minimized” injuries to U.S. troops stationed at an Iraq airbase when Iranian missiles struck earlier this month. The Pentagon announced several dozen American troops troops suffered traumatic brain injuries (TBI) as a result of the Jan. 8 strikes; Trump referred to the injuries as “headaches” and “not very serious.” “In light of today's announcement from the defense department that 34 U.S. service members suffered traumatic brain injuries as a result of Iran's retaliatory strike...

Yet the people working here have an extraordinary responsibility. They make the final decision on whether a computer algorithm has correctly identified a gunshot - and whether to dispatch the police.

Allegations range from its tech not being accurate, to claims that ShotSpotter is fuelling discrimination in the police. In the wake of those negative...
__label__5 The media’s blatant failure in warning about the threat to Roe v. WadeOPINIONAs then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative judges to the Supreme Court one after the other, some in media gaslighted their audience about the impending end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...

After publicly promising to crack down, Facebook acknowledged in internal documents obtained by The Associated Press that it was “under-enforcing on confirmed abusive activity” that saw Filipina maids complaining on the social media site of being abused. Apple relented and Facebook and Instagram remained in the app store. But Facebook’s crackdown seems to have had a limited effect. Even today,...
__label__4 SCOTUS 2, Biden 0ANALYSISThe Supreme Court slapped down the Biden administration twice this week, giving the White House scant regard in a Tuesday dispute over asylum policy and late Thursday acidly rejecting its defense of an eviction moratorium tied to the surge in Covid-19 infections. The two actions reflect the fraught relationship between President Joe Biden and the conservative-dominated bench. The combined moves also demonstrate a flexing of ideological, if not political, muscle, even as the justices regularly declare themselves above partisanship. The Biden administration is facing multiple legal challenges in lower courts to its immigration, economic...

While this type of attack isn't new, Google has taken significant coordinated action to curb the trend.

Biden, a case with profound implications for American foreign policy, reached the Supreme Court with lightning speed. On August 13, a judge in Texas appointed by then-President Donald Trump effectively ordered the Biden administration to permanently reinstate Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. That policy, which is officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), requires many immigrants who seek asylum in the United States to stay in Mexico while they await a hearing. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s opinion in Texas was wrong for many reasons, including that he completely misread federal immigration law....

Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis ruled that Jones, 47, was liable by default after he was sued by parents of some of the children killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The families said they had been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers in the wake of his comments.

__label__5 The lapsed eviction moratorium is the Supreme Court’s faultOPINIONOn Sunday, a federal eviction moratorium, which was intended to prevent renters from losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic, expired. At its height, this moratorium may have saved as many as 40 million Americans from eviction. But, in late June, the Supreme Court signaled that this moratorium must expire at the end of July, effectively leaving many renters without protection. In theory, most of these renters — and their landlords — should have received federal housing assistance. Over the course of the pandemic, Congress allocated $45 billion in rent...

__label__4 Roe v. Wade Is Now in the Hands of the Three Trump JusticesANALYSISOne of the most interesting fissures that has opened up within the conservative legal movement in recent years has been between mainstream conservative lawyers and the growing performance artist faction of the lawyers for the Trump base. Soon, the conservative justices themselves will have to pick which side of the battle they are on: With the filing last week of a brief that explicitly asks the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v.

__label__1 Microchip shortage: Why US is poised to take rare actionA global shortage of microchips has crimped the availability of cars and other products. It’s also stirring discussion about something longer term: whether the U.S. needs an industrial policy to retain an edge in innovation. The computer chip shortage, which has disrupted supplies of everything from automobiles to wheelchair accessories, is pushing Congress to take big steps in helping America’s high-tech industry. Congress has already passed legislation to encourage semiconductor firms to build chip fabrication facilities, or fabs, in the United States. It has not yet authorized the funding. Not...
__label__5 How America lost its commitment to the right to voteANALYSISThe Supreme Court isn’t even pretending that it’s bound by legal texts in its voting rights cases. The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan lamented in a dissenting opinion earlier this month, “has treated no statute worse” than the Voting Rights Act. She’s right. The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most successful civil rights law in American history. Originally signed in 1965, it was the United States’ first serious attempt since Reconstruction to build a multi-racial democracy — and it worked. Just two years after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting...

__label__4 Trump’s Social Media Lawsuits Feature A Mashup Of Arguments Courts Have Already RejectedFormer president Donald Trump’s latest attempt at getting back on mainstream social media platforms came in the form of lawsuits on Wednesday against Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube — each featuring a series of claims that multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, have rebuffed. Trump was suspended from Facebook and Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 riots at the US Capitol and blocked from YouTube a few days later; all three companies cited posts that encouraged or supported the violence. He’d previously had messages that promoted baseless claims of voter fraud flagged as...

Here’s why.On Sunday night, the primary source for the Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files, an investigative series based on internal Facebook documents, revealed her identity in an episode of 60 Minutes. Frances Haugen, a former product manager at the company, says she came forward after she saw Facebook’s leadership repeatedly prioritize profit over safety. Before quitting in May of this year, she combed through Facebook Workplace, the company’s internal employee social media network, and gathered a wide swath of internal reports and research in an attempt to conclusively demonstrate that Facebook had willfully...
__label__5 Supreme Court upholds restrictive Arizona voting laws in test of Voting Rights ActThe Supreme Court on Thursday upheld two election laws in the 2020 battleground state of Arizona that challengers said make it harder for minorities to vote. The case was an important test for what's left of one of the nation's most important civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the Supreme Court scaled back in 2013. A remaining provision allows lawsuits claiming that voting changes would put minority voters at a disadvantage in electing candidates of their choice. Civil rights groups were hoping the Supreme Court would use the Arizona case...
__label__3 The Party of ViolenceOPINIONAdam Smith said, “There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.” It was meant as comfort. A lot can be wrong and still not signal the apocalypse. So let’s hope that the increasing fascination with political violence we are hearing from Republicans is a passing thing, and not a sign of unravelling. A Republican running for Northampton County executive in Pennsylvania gave a heated address on August 29 about mask mandates in schools. Steve Lynch is tired, he said, of providing his school board with arguments and data...
__label__2 Facebook grilled over mental-health impact on kidsFacebook has defended the impact of its products, saying Instagram has "affirmatively helped" young people. Its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, testified to the US Senate, about child protection. It comes after a leak exposed how Instagram's own research had found the platform could harm children’s well-being. Previously, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri said the app's effects on teenagers' mental health were "quite small". Instagram for kids paused after backlash Facebook under fire over secret teen research The committee opened by reiterating Facebook's own research - first reported on by...
__label__5 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...
__label__3 Kenosha Is A Political Liability For Democrats Because They Lit The Match And Watched It Go Up In FlamesOPINIONLast year's Jacob Blake and Kyle Rittenhouse shootings didn't just change the people of Kenosha; they also changed the politics. It’s been one year since an immigrant watched every vehicle in his car dealership go up in flames, one year since Rode’s Camera Shop became a pile of ashes and the country woke up to learn the name Kyle Rittenhouse after the teen killed two people. A year since businesses frantically tacked “Black Lives Matter” signs onto their storefronts and families spraypainted “Please, kids above” onto boarded-up windows hoping the mob would pass over them —...
__label__2 Facebook exec will testify at Senate hearing after report finds Instagram harms teen mental healthFacebook agreed to send Antigone Davis, global head of safety, to testify before the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection on Sept. 30, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The Washington Post reported the news earlier on Thursday. The hearing comes after The Wall Street Journal published a series of reports detailing internal discussions at Facebook, based on documents it obtained. One of the articles that sparked anger among lawmakers revealed that Facebook conducted research showing its Instagram app had a negative impact on many teenage girls’ mental health, despite testimony from top executives in...
__label__4 Leaders at COP26 Are 'Massively Killing the Paris Agreement,' Critics Say as Talks Drag On Past DeadlineAfter nearly two weeks of negotiations, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland was expected to extend into the weekend Friday as policymakers missed the evening deadline for finalizing their deal on how countries will combat the climate crisis—with leaders unable to come to an agreement thus far regarding financial support for the Global South, fossil fuel subsidies, and other key issues. Hundreds of campaigners representing Indigenous communities, young people, and civil society groups poured into the hallways of the venue where COP26 is taking place, chanting, "Keep...
__label__3 You Don’t Need To Go To Kabul To See The End Of American Order. It’s Right Here Among UsOPINIONIn many of our major cities, gangs of masked thugs and criminals do what they please -- and our far-better-armed police aren't allowed to stop it. The nation’s attention these past two weeks has focused nearly exclusively on Kabul, and rightly so given that the city has become the scene of the largest hostage situation in American history and a vivid image of the decline of Pax Americana abroad. Yet Americans don’t need to travel 7,500 miles to get a first-hand glimpse of the end of American order. In many...
__label__1 When AI breaks badANALYSISA new report about artificial intelligence and its effects warns AI has reached a turning point and its negative effects can no longer be ignored. The big picture: For all the sci-fi worries about ultra-intelligent machines or wide-scale job loss from automation — both of which would require artificial intelligence that is far more capable than what has been developed so far — the larger concern may be about what happens if AI doesn't work as intended. Background: The AI100 project — which was launched by Eric Horvitz, who served as Microsoft's first chief...
__label__5 Countries’ climate pledges built on flawed data, Post investigation findsMalaysia’s latest catalogue of its greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations reads like a report from a parallel universe. The 285-page document suggests that Malaysia’s trees are absorbing carbon four times faster than similar forests in neighboring Indonesia. The surprising claim has allowed the country to subtract over 243 million tons of carbon dioxide from its 2016 inventory — slashing 73 percent of emissions from its bottom line. Across the world, many countries underreport their greenhouse gas emissions in their reports to the United Nations, a Washington Post investigation has found. An examination of...
__label__3 In ‘Deep Blue’ New York, Voters Reject Democrats’ Push for Election ChangesIn one of the bluest states in the nation, voters soundly rejected proposed changes to election law that congressional Democrats are trying to impose nationally.  New York state voters voted “no” on Democrat-supported amendments to the state Constitution, pitched as “voting rights” measures, that would have expanded absentee voting, allowed same-day voter registration, and changed the rules on drawing legislative districts.  Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year have passed four bills that were variations of their initial bill, HR 1, dubbed the “For the People Act.” The measures would ban...
__label__1 Lawmakers Push Facebook To Abandon Instagram For Kids, Citing Mental Health ConcernsLawmakers on Capitol Hill are pressing Facebook to abandon its plans to build a version of its Instagram app for kids and demanding the company share research into how Instagram affects teenage users. Renewed scrutiny of Facebook's risks to teenagers' well-being was sparked by a Wall Street Journal story published Tuesday that revealed the social media giant's own research has found Instagram, the photo-sharing app it also owns, is particularly harmful to some teenage girls. On Wednesday, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Reps. Kathy Castor of Florida and Lori Trahan of Massachusetts,...
__label__4 Why some experts say corporate 'net-zero' emissions pledges could have net-zero impact on climate crisisDubbed a "code red for humanity" by the head of the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its most-recent report that the impacts of human-induced climate change are already being seen in "every region across the globe" and urgent action must be taken immediately, not decades into the future, to mitigate the devastation. As scientists sound the alarms, it has become near-impossible for business leaders to ignore the research -- or the global, youth-led protests spurred by activists like Greta Thunberg, who view climate change as an intergenerational justice issue -- as...
__label__3 Voters Are Done With COVID-19 and Pandemic-Powered OfficialsANALYSISPoliticians have been on a high over the last year-plus, wielding extraordinary power with the approval of voters fearful of viral infection. Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...
__label__1 U.S. airstrike kills senior al-Qaeda leader in Syria, DOD saysA U.S. airstrike in northwest Syria on Friday killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. Why it matters: Syria serves as a "safe haven" for the extremist group to plan external operations, according to U.S. Army Maj. John Rigsbee. What they're saying: "The removal of this al-Qaeda senior leader will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out global attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians," Rigsbee said in the statement. U.S. Central Command currently has "no indications of civilian casualties." The...
__label__5 Biden to Unleash 'Irrevocable Climate Chaos' if US Fracked Gas Export Projects Proceed: Groups"Would climate leaders build 399 new coal plants in the U.S.?" So asks an advertisement placed in Scotland's largest daily newspaper this week by U.S. environmental and climate justice groups during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, part of an effort to persuade the Biden administration to reject all new gas exports and fossil fuel infrastructure. "The answer is no," the ad says. "Yet right now, 23 liquefied natural gas export terminals and pipelines are sitting on your desks. These projects will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to doubling all existing...
__label__3 ‘Our Broken Elections’: Who Broke Them and Why, and How to Fix ThemOPINIONElection integrity is a fundamental requirement of a functioning democratic republic. In the freest nation in the world, our system of government and our very liberty depend on free and fair elections. Whether selecting a mayor or the president of the United States, every American must be able to trust the process, or the democratic system itself breaks down. When someone commits election fraud, the process is no longer fair, everyone’s vote gets diluted, and in some cases, election results are changed. Problems can arise not only from intentional misconduct...
__label__2 The Taliban’s Sharia Is the Most Brutal of AllOPINIONLate last month, the Taliban killed four men and hung their dead bodies in public squares in the northwestern Afghan city of Herat. One lifeless corpse dangled off a crane above throngs of commuters who were stunned at the exhibition and grasping the significance of the moment—a return to the past. The group’s newly appointed mayor declared the killed as kidnappers and boasted about the display of the dead as an effective deterrent. He warned: Other criminals would meet the same fate. Due process was an additional casualty of the...

The countries which have signed up are responsible for around 40 percent of methane emissions around the planet, whose molecules have a more powerful warming effect than carbon...
__label__3 Virginia GOP guarding unattended ballot drop boxesThe Republican Party of Virginia, unnerved by the high number of drop boxes around the commonwealth that are not monitored by public officials, has deployed volunteers to keep an eye on the ballot receptacles. Drop-box voting, launched by the state’s Democratic-run government in 2020 as part of COVID-19 measures, is a ballot security issue for the state GOP as Virginians decide the razor-close governor’s race between Republican Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Terry McAuliffe. “You have them in secure locations, namely in the registrar’s office, and they’re only accessible to the...
__label__2 Afghanistan: Deadly attack hits Kunduz mosque during Friday prayersA suicide bomb attack on a mosque in the Afghan city of Kunduz has killed at least 50 people, officials say, in the deadliest assault since US forces left. Bodies were seen scattered inside the Said Abad mosque, used by the minority Shia Muslim community. More than 100 people were injured in the blast in the northern city. The Islamic State group said it was behind the attack. Sunni Muslim extremists have targeted Shias who they see as heretics. IS-K, the Afghan regional affiliate of the IS group that is violently...
__label__4 Big Oil Climate Denial Hearing Features Even More DenialA landmark congressional hearing to probe the extent to which the oil industry misled the public about global climate change featured executives of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies and industry trade groups further downplaying climate science. “We know the combustion of oil and gas releases greenhouse gases,” Darren Woods, CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil, told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform before misrepresenting the findings of the world’s leading climate science body. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he said, “has concluded that increased greenhouse...
__label__2 How Virginia Democrats Are Working To Make Elections Sloppy AgainOPINIONThis portends poorly for the future of election integrity. It also proves a significant bellwether for our country heading into the 2022 midterm elections. Virginia’s gubernatorial race is seen as a national bellwether. With the most recent polls showing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former underdog, tied with his Democrat rival Terry McAuliffe, the outcome of the Nov. 2, 2021 election seems sure to rest on the smallest of margins. The more important trend for Americans to consider, however, lies not in the tight election, nor even in the party affiliation of the eventual victor,...
__label__2 From 9/11's ashes, a new world took shape. It did not last.ANALYSISIn the ghastly rubble of ground zero’s fallen towers 20 years ago, Hour Zero arrived, a chance to start anew. World affairs reordered abruptly on that morning of blue skies, black ash, fire and death. In Iran, chants of “death to America” quickly gave way to candlelight vigils to mourn the American dead. Vladimir Putin weighed in with substantive help as the U.S. prepared to go to war in Russia’s region of influence. Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, a murderous dictator with a poetic streak, spoke of the “human duty” to be...
__label__4 In Germany, global warming is changing more than just the climate. It’s changing politics, too.Layers of dried mud on sidewalks, concrete roads turned to gravel and time-worn stone bridges washed away. Three months after this summer’s catastrophic floods in Germany’s Ahrweiler region, there are reminders everywhere of the destruction they wrought. The deluge, which was preceded by three consecutive summers of drought, has brought a new urgency for many to find climate change solutions — and that has impacted Germany’s politics, too. In last month’s federal election, the environmentalist Green Party had its best results yet, winning nearly 15 percent of the vote, and trailing just behind the two largest parties....
__label__3 Biden's Support Among Independents Has CrashedANALYSISWe are living through the era of unpopular presidents. Just nine months into his term, President Joe Biden has already achieved something only predecessor Donald Trump managed before him: an average approval rating south of 45 percent in the third quarter of his first year. According to an Oct. 1-19 Gallup poll of 832 American adults released today, Biden was at 42 percent overall, down from 57 percent in January. Trump at this juncture was at 37 percent, on his way to becoming the least popular president in the modern polling era, never cracking 50...

Nine gunmen and suicide bombers struck within minutes of each other at France’s national soccer stadium, the Bataclan concert hall and Paris restaurants and cafes on Nov. 13, 2015. Survivors of the attacks as well as those who mourn their dead packed the rooms, which were designed to hold 1,800 plaintiffs and over...
__label__4 'Deluge' in a drought: Millions of Californians warned of flash flooding risk on SundayDrought-stricken regions of Northern California could see "excessive rainfall" — as much as 8-10 inches of rain — when an extreme weather system hits the West Coast this weekend, the National Weather Center warns. Millions of people in Northern California were at some risk for flash floods on Sunday due to the system, known as an "atmospheric river," the Weather Prediction Center said Saturday. Meanwhile, residents of a small swathe of coastal Santa Barbara County were told to evacuate Friday due to mudslide concerns. The weather system is expected to begin hitting the coast on Saturday night....
__label__3 DOJ officials rejected claims of Trump meddling in 2020 election probes: Senate reportFormer President Donald Trump made “relentless” efforts to get the Justice Department to dig into reports of election malfeasance in the wake of the 2020 vote, but the department’s leaders said he did not pressure them into crossing any lines, according to two new Senate reports Thursday. Mr. Trump twice rejected sending a draft letter that had been prepared by an acting assistant attorney general recommending some state legislatures reject the public vote tallies and send a different slate of electors, the Republican staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded. The former president also rejected the idea of...
__label__2 Does the U.S. have any real leverage over the Taliban?Since retaking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have tried to assure the rest of the world that their new government will be different from the brutal, oppressive regime that ruled the country in the years before the American invasion. They have vowed to respect women’s rights to some degree, forgive those who had allied with the U.S. military and prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a staging ground for attacks. “We want the world to trust us,” a Taliban spokesperson said. Unsurprisingly, the notion of a kinder, gentler Taliban has been met with deep...

And not a small one.In a different era, the massive leak might have gone unnoticed.But hovering 520 miles above the Earth, a European Space Agency satellite was keeping watch. The four-year-old Copernicus Sentinel-5P, which orbits the planet 14 times a day, looks for traces of methane and other gases.
__label__2 RNC Suing 2 Vermont Cities for Giving Voting Rights to NoncitizensThe Republican National Committee and the Vermont GOP are suing two cities in the Green Mountain State over new charters allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections. The state Senate in May approved changes to charters in the cities of Montpelier and Winooski. The RNC said the charters violate the state constitution which requires Vermont voters to be U.S. citizens. "Democrats are trying to dismantle the integrity of our elections," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement Tuesday. "In addition to attacking widely supported safeguards like voter ID, Democrats also want...

Three of the shoppers were taken to Auckland hospitals in critical condition, police said. Another was in serious condition, while two more were in moderate condition. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the incident was a terror attack. She said the man was a...
__label__4 From Soda to Blackouts, A Global Gas Crisis Is Causing HavocChina is experiencing rolling blackouts and factory shutdowns. U.K. soda shelves may soon be empty. Fertilizer plants are shutting down and slaughterhouses are growing wary of how long they can withstand periods without a crucial ingredient they need to keep up meat production.  The common denominator between all of these strained industries is a crucial, yet perhaps unexpected commodity: natural gas.  A confluence of factors, and political entities (governments of China, Russia, the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U., to name a few) have coalesced and caused global natural gas prices to surge to record highs. This is...
__label__3 Arizona Senate Hears of Multiple Inconsistencies Found by Election AuditArizona lawmakers were told on Friday during a hearing on an audit conducted in the state’s most populous county of inconsistencies uncovered during a forensic audit into the 2020 election. The Maricopa County audit was commissioned by Republicans in the Arizona Senate. Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican, issued a letter on the same day to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich recommending further investigation following the audit’s findings. In the letter, she raised concerns over signature verification on mail-in ballots, the accuracy of voter rolls, the securing of election systems, and the...

__label__5 Major Climate Action at Stake in Fight Over Twin Bills Pending in CongressPresident Biden has framed this moment as the country’s best chance to save the planet. “The nation and the world are in peril,” he said weeks ago in Queens, where 11 people drowned in their basement apartments after floodwaters from Hurricane Ida devastated communities from Louisiana to New York. “And that’s not hyperbole. That is a fact. They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living in it real time now.” Mr. Biden’s plan to try to fortify the United States against extreme weather — and...
__label__3 2020 Is Toxic for RepublicansOPINIONThe best indication that Larry Elder was going down hard in the California recall wasn’t the polling, although that all swung the wrong way in the final weeks, but his suggestion late in the campaign that Democrats were going to steal the election. Preemptive excuse-making isn’t a sign of great confidence — the winning side never complains of cheating. Sure enough, incumbent governor Gavin Newsom cruised to a victory made a little easier, as it happens, by Elder’s insistence that Republicans were robbed in 2020 and about to be robbed again. To his...
__label__1 Will Afghanistan become a haven for terrorism again?When the United States invaded Afghanistan 20 years ago, the primary mission was to root out the al-Qaida terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and the Taliban regime that had given them safe harbor. The recent withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country, which allowed the Taliban to swiftly regain control, has sparked debate over whether Afghanistan could once again become a staging ground for extremists to plan acts of terror in the U.S. and around the world. In his address to the nation on Monday, President Biden called...
__label__4 ‘Eco’ wood stoves emit 750 times more pollution than an HGV, study showsNew wood burning stoves billed as more environmentally friendly still emit 750 times more tiny particle pollution than a modern HGV truck, a report has shown. Only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold from the start of 2022 in the UK and EU, but experts said the regulation was shockingly weak. The report used data on the emissions produced by stoves in perfect laboratory conditions and the pollution could be even higher in everyday use, the researchers said, with older stoves being much worse. Tiny particle...
__label__3 Civil rights groups challenge new Texas voting legislationCivil rights groups on Friday filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to block Texas’ new voting legislation, saying it would violate the civil rights of minorities by making it more difficult for them to cast their ballots. “The Texas Legislature’s claims of voter fraud and voter integrity are merely pretexts for their actual purpose in enacting SB1, which is to make it harder for citizens of color and citizens with disabilities to cast their votes,” said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of...
__label__1 Taliban Seize Kandahar, Prepare to March on Afghan Capital KabulThe Taliban completed the seizure of Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the Islamist movement’s birthplace, and took into custody a warlord who organized the failed defenses of the western city of Herat. Combined with other advances, including the capture of the provincial capital of Helmand, the fall of these two major cities has given the Taliban full control of southern and western Afghanistan, allowing the insurgent movement to pool its forces for a final march on Kabul. The U.S. has already launched the drawdown of its large embassy in Kabul, sending troops...
__label__4 Google wants to show flyers their carbon emissions with flight options in sustainable travel pushThis Wednesday, Google launched a new feature that displays a carbon emissions estimate for nearly every flight in its search results next to the price and duration of the flight. It'll allow eco-conscious travelers to factor carbon emissions into their choice when deciding which flight to book. These emissions estimates are flight-specific as well as seat-specific. For instance, newer aircraft generally pollute less than older aircraft, and emissions increase for premium economy and first-class seats because they take up more space and account for a larger share of total emissions, according to Richard Holden, Google's vice president of...
__label__3 Texas Legislature Passes Election Integrity LegislationThe Republican-controlled Texas state House and Senate on Tuesday passed the final versions of the controversial voter integrity legislation, which the Democrats tried to oppose for months. The House voted to pass the bill 80-41 with only one Republican joining the Democrats, and the Senate passed the legislation hours later with an 18-13 party-line vote. After the bill’s passage — a major victory for the Republicans — the text will now go to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s (R) desk to be signed into law. Abbott, in trying to pass the bill, had called...

The clamor to flee the country is growing as borders are closed, choking the outflow of people and inflow of essential supplies. The insurgents have encircled the country and besieged the cities. They now control most border passes into the landlocked country. Billions of dollars in customs revenues are...
__label__5 We can’t just run away from wildfiresANALYSISIt has been yet another breathtaking year for disasters. While Hurricane Ida drenched a path from New Orleans to New York, leaving flooding and power outages in its wake, wildfires forced thousands to evacuate and sent choking smoke across the US. Such disasters are a fact of life in many parts of the country, and the risks are only growing as human activity continues to warm the planet. For those living in the West within reach of devastating blazes, that raises a difficult question: Should I stay or should I go?

Now, let’s talk about the mess in which we find our election system. Let’s talk about voter fraud. It does exist; claims to the contrary are incorrect. And discussions about voting integrity matter because we have about one year to decide how to avoid the confusion and controversy surrounding the 2020 election. “Flagrant” election fraud has been “documented throughout this nation’s history,” according to the U.S. Supreme Court. And so it goes today....
__label__2 U.S. expands Afghan refugee program as Taliban violence escalatesThe State Department announced Monday it is expanding grants of eligibility for refugee status in the U.S. for at-risk Afghans, citing an increase in violence by the Taliban ahead of the U.S. military's total withdrawal. Why it matters: The Biden administration has faced pressure to do more to help Afghans who assisted the U.S. military over the course of the two-decade war. The expansion will allow thousands more Afghans and their family members to apply for permanent refugee resettlement, according to the State Department. Details: The program covers Afghans who worked with the U.S. as locally-employed...
__label__4 How to end the American obsession with drivingOPINIONThis summer’s series of extreme wildfires, hurricanes, and tropical storms have made it more apparent than ever that the effects of climate change are here. Limiting the damage caused by future disasters will require a whole-of-government approach — one not limited to what the federal government can do. There’s a host of ideas that states and municipalities could implement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in some of the world’s biggest polluters: American cities. According to a 2021 study published in Frontiers, Houston, Chicago, and Los Angeles have some of the highest...
__label__3 Biden accused of exacerbating labor shortage with ‘far-left socialist agenda’U.S. employers are still struggling to find workers six weeks after enhanced federal jobless benefits expired, but that doesn’t mean Republicans are letting President Biden off the hook. The National Federation of Independent Business reported last week that a record 51% of small-business owners had openings in September that they could not fill, a 48-year high, even though the boost in unemployment benefits ended on Labor Day. The shortage indicates that other factors are at play. Among them are a rash of accelerated retirements, a soaring personal savings rate, ongoing coronavirus fears...
__label__2 Biden Administration Lays Out Broad Strategy for Targeting Domestic TerrorismThe Biden administration is seeking increased funds for the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation and promoting programs for civic education and digital literacy to counter a rise in domestic terrorism, according to a broad new strategy released Tuesday morning. The 32-page policy, developed during a monthslong review, presents a governmentwide approach to President Biden’s campaign promise to reduce attacks by domestic extremists. It includes several actions already under way, such as increased funding for state and local programs to combat domestic violent extremism. The White House’s plans were released by the...
__label__4 How These Ultrawealthy Politicians Avoided Paying TaxesAs a member of Congress, Jared Polis was one of the loudest Democrats demanding President Donald Trump release his tax returns. At a rally in Denver in 2017, he warned the crowd that Trump “might have something to hide.” That same year, on the floor of the House, he introduced a resolution to force the president to release the records, calling them an “important baseline disclosure.” But during Polis’ successful run for governor of Colorado in 2018, his calls for transparency faded. The dot-com tycoon turned investor broke with recent...

On Thursday, 34 House Republicans and 15 Senate Republicans voted with Democrats to approve $6.4 billion in taxpayer money for the roughly 95,000 Afghans that Biden hopes to bring to the U.S. over the next 12 months — a population nine times larger than Jackson, Wyoming’s resident population.

__label__1 Lack of Vaccines Fuels Terrorism in AfricaANALYSISEarlier this month, leaders from across Africa convened in Paris to discuss the most pressing challenge facing the continent today: economic recovery in the wake of the most destructive global health crisis in living memory. Over the course of that summit, a common theme emerged. There is a direct line threading a lack of vaccines to lockdowns to economic depression to the resurgence of Islamist terrorism.
__label__4 Sinema’s Tax-Rate Blockade Prods Democrats Left Toward Billionaires’ TaxSenator Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona and one of her party’s only holdouts on President Biden’s sprawling budget bill, has cultivated a profile in Congress as a business-minded centrist. But her refusal to raise tax rates on high earners and major corporations to pay for Mr. Biden’s plan is pushing Democrats toward wealth taxation and other measures once embraced only by the party’s left flank. The frenzied search for new paths around Ms. Sinema’s tax-rate blockade has cheered liberals but raised serious qualms among more moderate Democrats, who now openly say they hope that...

Short-term assistance becoming long-term 'trap,' report warnsExpanded federal unemployment benefits, put in place as an emergency measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, are on course to become another long-term "welfare trap," a government fiscal watchdog group warns in a new report.  Under emergency response legislation, the federal government expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits, extended the number of weeks, and gave bonuses to state unemployment benefits. The expansion will sunset in September, but congressional Democrats have pressed President Biden for an extension.

From the bridge over the railroad, William White can trace the contours of the crowded city streets where he grew up, not far from the slaughterhouses and factories that abutted the tracks below. Those industries are long gone, and his working-class neighborhood is now a magnet for gourmet-doughnut browsing millennials.  More may be coming. ...
__label__5 Eight Things We Learned From The Facebook PapersFor months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted...
__label__3 Economic Freedom Best Path to Women’s Equality, EmpowermentOPINIONWomen’s battle for equal rights under the law has progressed significantly in a number of countries, but many other nations still have much room for improvement to establish societies that uphold women’s equality and dignity. So, what’s the solution to decreasing this gender gap worldwide? There’s considerable evidence that the best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The World Bank Group’s Women, Business and the Law 2021 annual report outlines the importance of gender equality for women’s...
__label__1 Bipartisan infrastructure deal omits major climate change measuresWhite House negotiators and a group of senators struck a deal on a bipartisan infrastructure agreement on Thursday that slashes measures to combat climate change and help the U.S. transition to a clean energy economy. The narrow infrastructure deal leaves President Joe Biden’s proposals on climate change to a separate bill that Democrats could attempt to pass through Congress using reconciliation, a process that doesn’t require Republican support. The second package could also include programs related to child and elder care, education, and health care, in addition to climate change measures, issues that administration officials...
__label__5 Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen calls for urgent external regulationMark Zuckerberg “has unilateral control over 3 billion people” due to his unassailable position at the top of Facebook, the whistleblower Frances Haugen told MPs as she called for urgent external regulation to rein in the tech company’s management and reduce harm to society. Haugen, a former Facebook employee who released tens of thousands of damaging documents about its inner workings, travelled to London from the US for a parliamentary hearing and gave qualified backing to UK government proposals to regulate social media platforms and make them take some responsibility for content...
__label__3 Drafting Our DaughtersOPINIONLast week, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a provision, to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act, that would require women to register with Selective Service, that is, the military draft. This is a grave mistake, but not a surprising one. Requiring women to register with the Selective Service has long been avoided by lawmakers, even as they have gradually eliminated exclusions aimed at shielding women from exposure to direct combat, in part due to its abiding unpopularity. In 2016, however, the last of these restrictions was removed, opening combat arms...
__label__2 Biden will meet with infrastructure negotiators as bipartisan group moves closer to a dealPresident Joe Biden will meet with Democratic and Republican infrastructure negotiators at the White House on Thursday, as senators say they have moved closer to a deal to revamp transportation, broadband and utilities. “White House senior staff had two productive meetings today with the bipartisan group of Senators who have been negotiating about infrastructure,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Wednesday night. “The group made progress towards an outline of a potential agreement, and the President has invited the group to come to the White House tomorrow to...
__label__5 Facebook is planning to rebrand the company with a new nameFacebook is planning to change its company name next week to reflect its focus on building the metaverse, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under...
__label__3 Transgender Woman Wins Miss Nevada USA Pageant TitleA transgender woman has won the Miss Nevada USA title for the first time in the pageant’s history. Kataluna Enriquez now advances to represent the state in the national Miss USA competition scheduled for November 29. Enriquez beat out 21 women for the designation, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. “One thing that is important for me is inclusivity, diversity and representation. It’s something I did not have growing up and is still lacking in today’s world,” said Enriquez. “Today I am a proud transgender woman of color. Personally, I’ve learned that...
__label__2 Some 48 million Americans will travel on July 4 — but they’ll pay through the nose for rental cars and gasSome 48 million Americans are hopping on trains, planes and automobiles over the July 4 weekend. Most, it seems, will be traveling by road. That’s a nearly 40% jump from last year when 34 million Americans visited family on the federal holiday during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, many against the advice of health professionals, according to data from AAA. Still, the expected number of travelers is trailing below 2019 when some 49 million Americans, a record-high, traveled over the holiday. The resurgence in travel comes as more than...
__label__4 Revealed; Facebook's Secret Blacklist of "Dangerous Individuals and Organizations"TO WARD OFF accusations that it helps terrorists spread propaganda, Facebook has for many years barred users from speaking freely about people and groups it says promote violence. The restrictions appear to trace back to 2012, when in the face of growing alarm in Congress and the United Nations about online terrorist recruiting, Facebook added to its Community Standards a ban on “organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity.” This modest rule has since ballooned into what’s known as the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, a sweeping set of restrictions on what Facebook’s nearly...
__label__3 Young Women Lose under Biden’s Title IX EdictANALYSISPresident Joe Biden’s Department of Education has issued guidance declaring that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination — or so-called discrimination — on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The new guidance mirrors the stance taken by Barack Obama’s administration during the final year of his presidency, when the Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter tacking on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to the definition of sex discrimination as outlined in Title IX. Wielding this radical redefinition of terms, the Obama administration proceeded to mandate that federally...
__label__2 Behind stalled bill: Infrastructure is about visions for AmericaPresident Biden’s struggles to find agreement in Congress to overhaul U.S. infrastructure aren’t just about dollar totals. They’re also about values: What kind of 21st century should we build? United States Route 275 has all the signs of a split personality. Running east out of Norfolk, Nebraska, it’s a four-lane divided highway for 12 miles until, inexplicably, it narrows to a two-lane road and makes a long lazy bend southward to Scribner, where it becomes a four-lane again all the way to Omaha. That 45-mile stretch of unimproved country lane...
__label__4 Big tech sweeps up Hill staffers — just when Congress needs them the mostSilicon Valley and the telecom industry are snatching up some of the top Democratic policy experts on Capitol Hill — just as Congress gears up for fights with the companies. The brain drain has seen more than a dozen senior Democratic tech and telecom policy staffers leaving their posts this year, according to a POLITICO review of recent exits, with many taking lobbying roles at powerhouses including Facebook, Verizon, Apple, Charter Communications, the National Association of Broadcasters and the cloud company VMware. They’re leaving members’ personal offices as well as the Senate...
__label__3 Biden Budget Proposal Refers To Mothers As ‘Birthing People’President Joe Biden’s $6 trillion budget proposal demands $200 million for maternal health care — but refers to mothers as “birthing people,” adopting progressive parlance designed to ignore gender-based distinctions. The provision appears in the budget draft’s healthcare spending designations, in a line item that allocates “$200 million to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates nationwide; bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees; help cities place early childhood development experts in pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients; implement implicit bias training for healthcare...
__label__1 Top 1% dodge $163 billion in annual taxes, Treasury estimatesThe top 1% of Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in annual taxes, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  This estimate widens the so-called tax gap — the shortfall between how much is owed and collected — to $600 billion every year, the report outlines. The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...
__label__5 Whistleblower Frances Haugen to meet with Facebook Oversight BoardFacebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who told a Senate subcommittee last week that the social media company is putting profit over the safety of users, will meet with the Facebook Oversight Board in the "coming weeks," the board said in a blog post. "In light of the serious claims made about Facebook by Ms. Haugen, we have extended an invitation for her to speak to the Board," the blog post said. "The choices made by companies like Facebook have real-world consequences for the freedom of expression and human rights of billions of people across the...
__label__3 Why the Supreme Court should deliver a death blow to Roe v. WadeOPINIONThis week, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Mississippi’s 2018 Gestational Age Act. This law bans abortion after 15 weeks into a pregnancy. A central question in the case will be “viability”: whether a fetus can survive outside the womb at 15 weeks. This case provides an opportunity for the Supreme Court to deliver a much-deserved death blow to Roe v. Wade. In 1973, Roe opened the door for abortion on demand and the tragic deaths of more than 63 million unborn children. For decades, conservatives and anti-abortion voters...
__label__2 Treasury Dept to invoke ‘extraordinary measures’ as Congress misses debt-ceiling deadlineThe Treasury Department will begin conducting emergency cash-conservation steps on Monday to avoid busting the federal borrowing limit after a two-year suspension of the debt ceiling expired at the end of July. Economists say those so-called extraordinary measures will allow Treasury to pay off the government’s bills without floating new debt for two to three months. After that, Congress will need to either raise or suspend the borrowing limit or risk the U.S. defaulting on its obligations. The limit, a facet of American politics for over a century, prevents the...
__label__4 No evidence whistleblower Frances Haugen was planted by FacebookANALYSISA viral image circulating on social media baselessly claimed that former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, who turned over troves of internal company documents to the Wall Street Journal, was not a real whistleblower, but a plant set up by Facebook itself. "Imagine planting your own whistleblower to expose yourself for not censoring enough so you can censor more," the image said in a text caption, which was overlaid on top of a photo from Haugen’s Oct. 3 interview with CBS News’ "60 Minutes." Posts sharing the image received nearly 25,000 interactions on Facebook and Instagram,...
__label__3 South Dakota’s Governor Signs Executive Orders to Ensure Fairness in Girls’ SportsSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem signed two executive orders (pdf) (pdf) Monday evening to limit participants in female sports to biological females. This comes after the state legislature failed to make proposed revisions to the bill that would have stopped transgender females from competing in girls and women’s sports. “Only girls should play girls’ sports. Given the legislature’s failure to accept my proposed revisions to HB 1217, I am immediately signing two executive orders to address this issue: one to protect fairness in K-12 athletics, and another to do so...
__label__2 U.S. proposes global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, with an eye on something even higherCorporations around the world should pay at least a 15% tax on their earnings, the Treasury Department said Thursday as part of its push for a global minimum for businesses. The final rate could go even higher than that, according to a Treasury release that said the 15% minimum is a “floor and that discussions should continue to be ambitious and push that rate higher.” U.S-based companies currently pay a 21% rate, a level that was slashed during the Trump administration. Previously, the top rate had been 35%. Under a proposal...
__label__4 Fact-checking Zuckerberg's statement defending companyFACT CHECKFollowing congressional testimony from whistleblower Frances Haugen, in a Facebook post Tuesday night the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, pushed back against Haugen's allegations that the tech giant is hiding research about its shortcomings from investors and the public. In a 1,300-word statement, Zuckerberg defended Facebook's services and, appealing to its employees, suggested that both their work and the company as a whole were being misrepresented. Here's a look at what Zuckerberg claimed and what we know. In response to claims from Haugen and an investigation by the Wall Street Journal that Instagram, which is owned by...
__label__3 ‘Not Refugees’: Polish Government Fact-Checks CNN on Belarus-Engineered Migrant CrisisANALYSISPoland’s national-conservative government has fact-checked CNN on the migrant crisis engineered on the European Union’s eastern border by Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman for the Minister-Coordinator of Special Services at National Security Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, admonished CNN after it published an article on the ongoing border crisis, which has seen mostly Middle Eastern and South Asian migrants clashing with Polish border guards, police officers, and soldiers manning the frontier. The American news outlet, Żaryn alleged, had “missed the point” by characterising the situation as one in which...
__label__1 U.S. Treasury increases second-quarter borrowing estimate due to COVID-19 responseThe U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow $463 billion in the second quarter, more than the February estimate of $95 billion, as it increases spending in response to COVID-19. The second-quarter estimate assumes an end-June cash balance of $800 billion, the Treasury said in a statement. It comes after the Treasury in February slashed its borrowing projections for the first and second quarters as part of a plan to reduce its cash balance. The Treasury said it issued $401 billion in net debt in the first quarter,...
__label__5 Facebook whistleblower to talk to January 6 committeeThe Facebook whistleblower who released thousands of documents that she says shows the company knows its platforms are used to spread hate, violence and misinformation is expected to meet with the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol as soon as Thursday, three sources with knowledge tell CNN. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager with stints at several other big tech companies, went public with an appearance on "60 Minutes" and testified before a US Senate subcommittee on Tuesday. The select committee is also interested in hearing...
__label__3 China And The ‘G’ Word—GenocideOPINIONThough it acts as a court, it has no official status. The governments asked to participate have either snubbed or (in the case of China) condemned it. Some witnesses, under threat of sanctions from Beijing, started dropping out before its proceedings had even begun. And yet, the Uyghur Tribunal, whose final hearings took place in London in September, is an institution nobody can afford to ignore. It offers the best hope yet of answering a pressing question: is China committing genocide against the Uyghurs, the 12 million Turkic Muslims in...
__label__2 Russia Suspected In Major Cyberattack On U.S. Treasury, Commerce DepartmentsRussian hackers working for the Kremlin are believed to be behind an attack into U.S. government computer systems at the departments of Treasury and Commerce that may have lasted months before it was detected, according to U.S. officials and media reports. The hackers reportedly broke into the email systems at those two government departments, but the full extent of the breach was not immediately clear as U.S. officials scrambled to make an assessment. There are concerns that hackers may have penetrated other government departments and perhaps many private companies as...
__label__5 Is This Facebook’s ‘Big Tobacco’ Moment?ANALYSISFacebook Inc. executives have long boasted that its platforms are safe, even as they invested in ways to keep teenagers hooked and hid what they knew about the side effects. Sound familiar? Critics say Big Tobacco once used the same playbook, and it’s fueling a whole new level of outrage against the social media giant. Facebook consistently played down its own research that showed how photo-sharing app Instagram can harm the mental well-being of its youngest users, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Almost a third of young teen girls told...
__label__3 Leaked text suggests Macron conned Biden into sympathy over sub dealA newly revealed text message from French President Emmanuel Macron indicated he knew a multibillion-dollar submarine deal with Australia was on the rocks days before the Land Down Under announced a nuclear sub pact with the US and the UK.That message seemed to call into question the Paris government’s assertions that it had been blindsided by the new agreement.
__label__2 At Least 8.7 Million Americans At Risk Of Losing $1,200 Stimulus ChecksANALYSISAt least 8.7 million or more Americans could be at risk of losing out on $1,200 coronavirus stimulus checks due to incomplete IRS and Treasury Department records, according to a Monday report from Congress’ auditing arm, which examined the unprecedented $2.6 trillion lawmakers passed in emergency support as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. The Treasury Department determined in April that there was no data available for 14 million people who do not normally file tax returns or receive federal benefits, but were eligible for the stimulus payments, according to the...
__label__5 How one anti-mask activist leveraged TikTok and Facebook to spur local school protests across the countryOPINIONA conservative activist was able to leverage TikTok and Facebook in less than five months to spark nationwide school protests against masks and vaccines, prompting some school districts to respond.  After a TikTok video encouraging conservative protests around the country went viral in April, the account owner created Freedom515, an organization that now has a network of 51 private Facebook groups and over 30,000 members. In the months that followed, the user leveraged both platforms to organize numerous right-wing protests for people fed up with “the direction of things,” including...

__label__2 Treasury Probes Claims of Racial Discrimination at U.S. MintThe Treasury Department said it has opened an investigation into allegations of racial harassment and discrimination raised by Black employees at the U.S. Mint, the government entity responsible for circulating coins in the country. A group of Black employees at the Mint wrote a letter in June asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to intervene and address what they say is “rampant racism” at the bureau, according to the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In the letter and meetings with Treasury officials, the Black employees said that...
__label__5 Taliban blames ISIS-K for deadly attack on hospital in Afghanistan's capitalTwo explosions rocked Kabul on Tuesday in an attack targeting a large military hospital in the Afghan capital. A Taliban official confirmed that at least seven people were killed, but there were reports of a much higher death toll from the blasts and an ensuing gun battle..  It was the latest in a string of attacks in the weeks since the Taliban seized power in August following a two-decade insurgency against the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. A local official told AFP that 19 people were killed and about 50 others wounded...

It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__2 Why Is The Census Bureau Still Asking A Citizenship Question On Forms?You won't see a citizenship question on the 2020 census. After a more than year-long legal fight, three federal judges are making sure of that by permanently blocking the Trump administration from using next year's head count to ask about the U.S. citizenship status of every person living in every household in the country. But the Census Bureau, which conducts more than 100 surveys for the federal government, is continuing to ask about citizenship on other forms, which have sparked plenty of confusion around the country. Unlike the census, these...
__label__4 Long-Secret FBI Report Reveals New Connections Between 9/11 Hijackers and Saudi Religious Officials in U.S.A long-suppressed FBI report on Saudi Arabia’s connections to the 9/11 plot has revealed that Saudi religious officials stationed in the United States had more significant connections to two of the hijackers than has been previously known. The 2016 report was released late Saturday night under an executive order from President Joe Biden, who promised to make it public no later than the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks that killed 2,977 people and injured more than 6,000 others. The 16-page document was a final inventory of circumstantial evidence and leads...

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed Wednesday that President Biden had spoken out against human rights abuses in China — whereas, she said, President Trump did not. In response to a question about whether the Biden administration was overlooking China’s genocide of Uighur Muslims as it sought cooperation with the communist government on climate change, Psaki...

There wasn't any specific event that led President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to execute the plan, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Thursday afternoon, but rather the overall worsening trend in Afghanistan. "There wasn't one precipitating event in the last couple of days that led the president and the secretary to make...
