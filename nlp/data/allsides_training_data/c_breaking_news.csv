THE QUICK FACTS
On April 28th, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at restoring the meat supply chain by classifying meat products under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and providing liability protection to meat processing plants that abide by CDC and OSHA guidelines. Trump noted that he had consulted with Tyson Foods before the order was written.Despite the headlines, the executive order itself does not actually order meat processing plants to do anything; rather, it incentivizes plants to reopen and gives Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue the authority to reopen plants ""to promote the national defense.""American meat production has fallen dramatically due to the pandemic, with meat industry companies considering keeping just 20% of plants open. Beef and pork production are already down 35% from this time last year, and chicken production is down 7% (WSJ). Since the executive order, seven more plants have shut down.As of May 6th, over 10,000 coronavirus cases have been linked to meat processing plants. At least 45 workers have died so far.

On Friday, The New York Times reported that American intelligence officials had concluded that Russian intelligence agency G.R.U. was offering bounties to Taliban fighters for killing U.S. and allied forces while U.S.-Taliban peace talks were underway. On Monday, the Associated Press reported that the White House was aware of the bounties as early as 2019.While the Times reported that the issue was briefed to President Trump and discussed by the National Security Council, President Trump disputed the claims, tweeting: ""Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or [Vice President Pence]."" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany backed up the President's defense on Monday.Lawmakers from both major parties called for answers, prompting the White House to hold two separate briefings for select groups of congressmen: Republicans on Monday, Democrats on Tuesday morning. Republican lawmakers confirmed the intelligence but said they needed further information before approving retaliatory action.If American soldiers are confirmed to have died as a result of Russian bounties, it would significantly escalate tensions with Russia, which has provided intelligence, weapons, and financial support to the Taliban since 2013 (IFRI).

THE QUICK FACTS
On Thursday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Harvard's affirmative action policy does not violate civil rights law. Last year, a federal judge had originally ruled that Harvard did not discriminate based on race and the plaintiffs appealed that decision shortly thereafter. Harvard argued that it considers race as one of many factors in its admissions process (which is allowed under current law) while the plaintiffs argued that Harvard systematically discriminated against Asian Americans. The plaintiffs for this case were represented by the non-profit Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA). SFFA founder Edward Blum has indicated interest in bringing the case forward to the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The SFFA has cases pending against the University of North Carolina and the University of Texas. In related news, citizens of California (a state in which affirmative action is banned) recently voted to continue to ban affirmative action for public employment, education, and contracting.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from For Harvard Policies to Against Harvard PoliciesHarvard vs. Asian-AmericansTwitter Thread from Nancy LeongStatement by American Council on EducationHarvard Wins ...

58,Europe,2,News,Sweden's Coronavirus Response,"This Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:
THE QUICK FACTS
While the rest of the developed world lives under lockdown, Sweden has allowed public spaces such as schools, gyms, cafes, bars and restaurants to remain open. However, public gatherings of 50 people or more have been banned. While no compulsory lockdown is in place, the Swedish government is trusting Swedes to follow social distancing guidelines on their own.While critics claim that the Swedish strategy is intentionally trying to develop ""herd immunity""--the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune--state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has denied that this is the intent.Swedish officials expect a 4% decline in GDP in 2020, matching the IMF's prediction of a 3% decline globally. This, however, falls well below Europe's predicted 7.5% decline, although those losses are led by Italy and Spain. 36,800 Swedes lost their jobs in March, matching a 0.1% increase in unemployment across the EU.As of May 4th, Sweden had 265 deaths per million people--lower than Belgium (676), Spain (540), Italy (477), the UK (419), France (381), and the Netherlands (295), but higher than the US (204), China (3), and Iran (73), as well as its neighbors in Ireland (263) Denmark (83), Norway (38), Finland (41), Germany (79), and Poland (17). Sweden's trend in daily cases (23 per million on May 4th) appears similar to other European trends.

THE QUICK FACTS
On April 28th, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at restoring the meat supply chain by classifying meat products under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and providing liability protection to meat processing plants that abide by CDC and OSHA guidelines. Trump noted that he had consulted with Tyson Foods before the order was written.Despite the headlines, the executive order itself does not actually order meat processing plants to do anything; rather, it incentivizes plants to reopen and gives Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue the authority to reopen plants ""to promote the national defense.""American meat production has fallen dramatically due to the pandemic, with meat industry companies considering keeping just 20% of plants open. Beef and pork production are already down 35% from this time last year, and chicken production is down 7% (WSJ). Since the executive order, seven more plants have shut down.As of May 6th, over 10,000 coronavirus cases have been linked to meat processing plants. At least 45 workers have died so far.

If the agreement is formally signed, the UAE will be the third Arab nation (after Egypt and Jordan) to normalize relations with Israel. Israel and the UAE have been dealing in secret for many years, largely motivated by a mutual distrust of Iran.

99,Palestine,2,News,Trump's Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism,"This Abridge News topic aggregates four unique arguments on different sides of the debate. Here are the quick facts to get you started:
THE QUICK FACTS
President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday afternoon which specifies that Jews on college campuses are protected under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when cases of discrimination are ""based on an individual's race, color, or national origin.""Anti-semitic incidents have risen sharply in recent years, particularly on college campuses. Incidents have ranged from harassment to physical violence, including the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018.On Tuesday, the New York Times reported incorrectly that the order would redefine Judaism as a nationality rather than a religion, stirring controversy among the Jewish community. However, it was later uncovered that the text of the order uses no such language.While the text of the order was less controversial than originally reported (and was, in fact, based on Obama administration guidance from 2010), a key point in the surviving debate has been the Trump administration's attempt to tie the recent rise in anti-semitism to criticism of Israel, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement specifically.You can read the full text of the order on whitehouse.gov.CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from Critical of the Order to Supportive of the OrderPresident Trump Is Defending Jewish StudentsPresident Trump's executive order on anti-Semitism does not make me feel saferPresident Trump’s executive order won’t redefine Judaism, but will complicate rising anti-SemitismTrump order to fight anti-Semitism at colleges shows he strongly supports Jews and Israel",Abridge News,Mixed,/Users/greysonnewton/Desktop/txt-spch/youtube/youtube_ai/nlp/data/allsides_training_data/images/Palestine2itemnum14.jpg

THE QUICK FACTS
As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, more and more people are facing the threat of housing insecurity. As state and local eviction moratoriums approach their end dates, millions are still out of work with no clear path forward. This has prompted local, state, and federal officials to call for further action to protect tenants and landlords alike.In March, Congress passed the CARES Act, which prohibited landlords of certain kinds of housing, including federally subsidized housing, from ""initiating eviction proceedings or 'charg[ing] fees, penalties, or other charges' against a tenant for the nonpayment"" until July 25th--one month from the publication of this topic (Congressional Research Service).As eviction moratoriums end, it is estimated that a large backlog of eviction cases will be filed, including 9,000 in North Carolina, 75,000 in Michigan, and 50,000 in New York City (BBC). While this trend directly affects tenants, it also hurts many landlords who rely on income from owned properties.Polls show that in May, 20-30% of Americans made partial or no rent payments, with 62% of renters worried about their ability to pay (Marketplace). As of May 2020, the U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% (BLS). For thirteen weeks straight, over one million people filed for unemployment benefits each week (New York Times).CLICK TO VIEW OPINIONS ranging from Local Interventions to Federal InterventionsTo fix Housing Court, keep it closed: A government-funded rental assistance program would better help tenant and landlord alikeAbsurd bill to give tenants a decade to repay rent should be rejectedHow To Protect New Haven TenantsEviction bans ending — massive eviction crisis looms",Abridge News,Mixed,/Users/greysonnewton/Desktop/txt-spch/youtube/youtube_ai/nlp/data/allsides_training_data/images/Welfare2itemnum5.jpg

On Wednesday, December 4th, the US Department of Agriculture announced a final rule that is projected to remove access to food stamps for 688,000 people.The rule limits the economic conditions under which states and counties can apply for waivers from work requirements. States and counties obtain waivers when unemployment is particularly high and issue them to their residents. The new rule raises the unemployment rate floor to 6%, among other things.The Trump administration's USDA has also proposed changing who qualifies for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).About 40 million Americans received assistance through SNAP in 2018, down from 42 million the previous year. 9.2% of American households received assistance through SNAP in 2017, including 16.7% of American children.
