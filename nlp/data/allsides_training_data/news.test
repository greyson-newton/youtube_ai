__label__5 Coronavirus Shock Is Destroying Americans’ Retirement DreamsCeci Dominguez celebrated her 67th birthday alone in her home in the Elysian Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles. The threat of coronavirus kept her from friends and family—and from the part-time jobs and informal gigs that keep her frugal budget balanced. As her few investments were plunging in value, she’d thought about driving down to the Census Bureau, where a job was waiting if she just got her picture taken and picked up an employee ID. The Census Bureau would pay $25 an hour, almost $11 more than the rate...

__label__1 Biden administration slaps sanctions on Belarus after it forcibly diverted passenger jet to arrest opposition journalistThe Biden administration slapped a slew of sanctions against Belarus on Monday amid Western fury over the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to arrest an opposition journalist. Last month, a passenger plane flying from Greece to Lithuania was suddenly diverted to Minsk, the capital of Belarus. The Ryanair flight was escorted to Minsk by a Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jet. Upon landing, authorities arrested opposition journalist Roman Protasevich. The extraordinary diversion of a commercial airliner was described by some European Union leaders as a “hijacking.” The 27-nation bloc swiftly imposed sanctions...
__label__4 Social Security and Medicare Are Not Safe With Joe BidenOPINIONEarlier this week, Bernie Sanders’s senior campaign adviser David Sirota sent an email to Sanders supporters drawing attention to a speech in which Joe Biden spoke favorably of cuts to Social Security and Medicare. “Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code,” Biden said in 2018. “What’s the first thing he decided we had to go after? Social Security and Medicare. We need to do something about Social Security and Medicare. That’s the only way you can find room to pay for it.” The fact-checking website PolitiFact took...

__label__1 Evictions of Palestinians could spark further conflict, Blinken warnsSecretary of State Tony Blinken warned Israeli leaders on his visit to Jerusalem this week that evictions of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem or further unrest on the Temple Mount could spark renewed “tension, conflict and war," he told me in a phone interview. What he’s saying: Speaking on his flight back from the Middle East, Blinken said the most important aspect of his trip was that he heard directly from Israel and indirectly from Hamas, through Egypt, that both want to maintain the ceasefire. “But it's also important that...
__label__5 Have you received one of those Social Security scam calls? There’s a new way to report it.ANALYSISIn one day, I received at least a half-dozen calls to my cellphone claiming to be from the Social Security Administration. “To avoid initial appearance before the magistrate judge [that] will lead to your Social Security number suspension, your case ID is 3392682,” the computerized voice said. “For more information on your case, please call our investigation department immediately. We would be glad to share your case information and help you with the situation. Thank you.” I’m sure the crooks would be glad to steal my personal information or frighten...

__label__2 Blinken Authorizes U.S. Embassies Worldwide to Display BLM FlagsU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has authorized U.S. embassies around the world to fly Black Lives Matter (BLM) flags and banners, according to an internal cable reviewed by Foreign Policy, as part of the administration’s response to the one-year anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd that sparked international outrage and a nationwide reckoning on systemic racism. The U.S. State Department cable gives chiefs of missions, who head U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide, “blanket written authorization” to display BLM flags and banners as “appropriate in light of local conditions.”...
__label__4 Trump wants to change how poverty is calculated — to make fewer people eligible for benefitsThe Trump administration has been incredibly consistent, from day one, about its desire to slash benefits for poor Americans, including Medicaid and food stamps (aka Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP). But with the threat of Democratic filibusters and now a Democratic majority in the House, Trump’s efforts to make those cuts a reality have been repeatedly stymied. That hasn’t stopped the administration from coming up with new attempts, and the latest is subtle but profound: changing the inflation rate used to update the poverty line. That might sound like...
__label__3 White House that promised transparency refuses to cooperate with IRS probeThe White House told Congress last week it refused to dig into its computers for emails that could shed light on what kinds of private taxpayer information the IRS shares with President Obama’s top aides, assuring Congress that the IRS will address the issue — eventually.
__label__1 U.S. Mounts All-Out Effort to Save Iran Nuclear DealU.S. President Joe Biden is intent on restoring the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, and with talks resuming in Vienna on Thursday after a weeklong break, his chief negotiator, Robert Malley, is beginning to develop a road map on how to get there.  According to sources close to European and U.S. negotiators, Malley is expected to offer Tehran a Goldilocks-style deal: just enough sanctions relief so Iran will return to the pact but not so much that it would leave Biden vulnerable to attacks from hard-liners at home, including...

__label__1 U.S. threatens boycotting 2022 Beijing Olympics with alliesThe U.S. has publicly raised the threat of a joint boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in China with its allies and partners, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a press conference on Tuesday. Why it matters: An Olympics boycott by the U.S. and its allies could help persuade the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into Beijing's actions in Xinjiang, human rights lawyer Djaouida Siaci tells Axios' Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian. Context: This would be the first U.S. Olympic boycott since Moscow in 1980 and comes as the Biden...

The answer to that simple question can help distinguish who lives in the United States vs. who is a citizen of the United States. The difference is important for different reasons, some of which are purely political, some solely economic and some of both. And regardless where you fall on the political spectrum — and whether you are a citizen or a resident — the question must be asked,...
__label__1 Russia’s Buildup Near Ukraine Puts Team Biden on EdgeRussia is massing an unusual number of troops on the border with Ukraine, posing an early test for the Biden administration as it looks to repair relations with NATO allies and distinguish itself from former U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial approach to relations with Moscow. The buildup of forces on the Ukrainian border, along with hundreds of cease-fire violations in Ukraine’s eastern territories controlled by Russia-backed separatists, has alarmed NATO and sparked a flurry of phone calls between senior members of the Biden administration and their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts.
__label__5 Social Security Numbers Of Every Federal Employee Stolen In Data Breach, Union SaysHackers stole personnel data and identity numbers for every federal employee, a government worker union said Thursday, charging that the cyberattack on U.S. employee data is far worse than the Obama administration has acknowledged. Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor that the December hack into Office of Personnel Management data was carried out by "the Chinese." Reid is one of eight lawmakers who is briefed on the most secret intelligence information. U.S. officials have declined to publicly blame China, which has denied involvement.
__label__3 Supreme Court Mulls Citizenship Question for CensusThis is another case in which Trump administration behavior is provoking plaintiffs to ask the judiciary to police the blurry boundaries of executive discretion. The oral arguments the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday will be more decorous than the gusts of judicial testiness that blew the case up to the nation’s highest tribunal. The case, which raises arcane questions of administrative law but could have widely radiating political and policy consequences, comes from the Enlightenment mentality of the nation’s Founders, and involves this question: Does it matter that a...

Seven new officials have joined the National Security Council’s Middle East team since Biden took office, officials familiar with the matter said.

At nearly midnight on Friday, 13 House Republicans gave Speaker Nancy Pelosi the votes she needed to pass the so-called “bipartisan infrastructure bill” — colloquially known in DC as the BIF. In doing so, these House Republicans, among them two members of the House GOP leadership team, all but guaranteed House passage of Joe Biden’s hotly partisan, $2 trillion reconciliation bill, which represents the largest cradle-to-grave...
__label__2 Biden Can’t Claim ‘Moral Leadership’ While Sanctioning the ICCOPINIONIn his Feb. 4 foreign-policy address, U.S. President Joe Biden vowed to make human rights and multilateralism cornerstones of his approach to global affairs. But that’s a pledge he appears to have forgotten just a day later, on Feb. 5, when the pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has the authority to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the West Bank and Gaza Strip—by Israeli and Palestinian personnel alike. Biden’s State Department immediately criticized the court’s scrutiny of...

Four sources familiar with the administration’s thinking said that after pausing half a billion dollars in arms deals with Saudi Arabia out of concern over casualties in Yemen earlier this year, officials are assessing the equipment and training included in recent sales to determine what can be considered defensive. Those deals would be allowed. A...
__label__4 OPINION: Democrats: Do not help Republicans carry out their sneaky anti-Social Security agendaOPINIONThe Republican plot to slash Social Security has moved to the Senate. After House Republicans changed the rules to ensure that the disability side of the program (SSDI) will run out of cash in late 2016, it was the Senate GOP's turn to bash the program in a Budget Committee hearing.

__label__4 To Win Back Older Voters, Democrats Talk Up Medicare and Social SecurityDemocrats are stepping up their appeals to older voters in the final stretch before the midterm elections, spurred by polls showing the party has regained some support lost in the Obama years. The question is whether they can narrow the gap with Republicans enough to offset their broader disadvantages given widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama. Both parties covet voters 65 and older because that group tends to make up a disproportionately large share of the midterm electorate. Democrats long had an edge, until less-supportive baby boomers aged and began replacing...

The Senate’s parliamentarian appeared to dash Democrats’ mass amnesty dreams Sunday, issuing an opinion that the rules for a budget reconciliation bill — a privileged legislative vehicle that can be passed with a simple majority — don’t encompass providing permanent legal status to millions of illegal migrants. Democratic leadership claimed they “are deeply disappointed,” but they know decision doesn’t matter, at least not as much as they’d like to...

The backstory: The coup came after Myanmar's ruling party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide election victory...

A group of Senate Republicans had hoped to announce a finalized agreement on Monday on a measure that would spend $1.2 trillion on roads, bridges, water projects, and broadband expansion. But Republicans now say the White House and Democrats are pushing for late changes to the measure that could sink the deal. Democrats say it’s the other...

__label__3 It’s Time to Make the House BiggerOPINIONGeorge Washington had an uncanny knack for getting things right at the last minute. As general of the Continental Army, Washington defused a conspiracy within his officer corps to revolt at the tail end of the Revolutionary War in the spring of 1783. Such a military revolt could have snuffed out American democracy in its infancy. In his old age, Washington, who had owned slaves since he was a young boy, ensured that all of his slaves would be freed upon his wife Martha’s death through his will.

The move follows four years of growing tensions between the United States and China, as outgoing Trump administration officials describe Beijing as the biggest threat to U.S. national security in the coming century.

Ambassador Craft was due to arrive in Taiwan Wednesday on a three-day visit that included meetings with President Tsai Ing-wen and other senior officials. Chinese officials had demanded the cancelation of the trip, which would have ended Washington’s self-imposed ban on such high-level contacts with the self-governing...

But the agreement announced Thursday by Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat; Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; and Sen.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the 2017 National Defense Strategy described an international environment of increased global disorder, long-term strategic competition, rapid dispersion of technologies, and eroding U.S. military advantages. Protecting the United States requires a strategy of defense in depth—that is, of identifying and dealing with global problems where they occur rather than waiting for...

Speculation about Kim's health has mounted after he failed to attend his late grandfather's birthday celebrations on April 15, the most important date in North Korea's calendar, known as "Day of the Sun." The rumors accelerated Tuesday when the South Korean website Daily NK cited one unnamed source as saying Kim, who is believed to be 36, had undergone heart...

The National Republican Congressional Committee raised over $14 million last month, its third straight record-breaking month for fundraising, the group says. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the same month brought in just under $10 million.

But better.ANALYSISOver recent years, “build back better” has become the mantra of reconstruction teams looking to rebuild communities devastated by natural disasters, from earthquakes to hurricanes, but in smarter, more sustainable ways. Now the transition team for President-elect Joe Biden is applying the guiding slogan of disaster recovery, which he employed during his campaign in reference to the entire United States economy, to the rebuilding of federal government agencies and departments. And, say U.S. diplomats, former ambassadors, and foreign policy experts, perhaps in no case is the “rebuild, but better” concept...

In contrast, South Korea on April 2 had fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases and 169 deaths. The disease rate there appears to be both low and stable, yet no South Korean city has gone under a full lockdown, and the main economic...
__label__3 Senate Republicans Introduce Bill Requiring Congressional Approval for New Iran DealSenate Republicans proposed legislation Friday that would require President Joe Biden to secure congressional approval before a new nuclear deal is forged with Iran. The bill stipulates that any agreement arrived at with the help of the Biden administration must be deemed a treaty and therefore receive Senate approval in accordance with the Constitution, according to a copy obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Sponsored by Senator Ron Johnson and 21 other Republicans, the legislation would add an additional check against Biden’s executive foreign-policy-making with the Iranian regime.

For Pompeo, it also has domestic political significance ahead of a possible presidential run in 2024.
__label__4 South Korea shows that democracies can succeed against the coronavirusSome commentators are arguing that China’s coronavirus response attests to the superiority of its authoritarian brand of governance and crisis management. In reality, it turns out that democracies are better suited to protect public health — at least, when they take advantage of their inherent strengths. One country is showing how it’s done: South Korea. “The advantages of the Chinese system have once again been demonstrated,” the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship paper said in a recent commentary — one that was approvingly quoted in the Wall Street Journal: “China’s battle...

The day after the nation's first COVID-19 lockdown took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he would never impose similar restrictions. Telling residents they may not leave their homes except for "essential" purposes "scares people," the Democratic governor told The New York Times on March 18, 2020, and "the fear, the panic, is a bigger problem than the virus." Cuomo unequivocally ruled out a stay-at-home order in New York. "That is...
__label__1 Threat to evacuate U.S. diplomats from Iraq raises fear of warWashington has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone.

That in turn would open the possibility of military...

That means he retains the ability to undo decades of international policy on a whim, an ability he continues to use with reckless abandon. In the latest souring of relations between the United States and South Korea, the two nations have suspended diplomatic negotiations on how to share costs for the U.S. troop presence...

__label__3 Schiff's Defense of Impeachment Comes From....British HistoryLawyers for former President Trump will challenge the constitutionality of impeaching a private citizen in the trial that is set to begin Tuesday. “The Senate must summarily reject this brazen political act,” his attorneys wrote in a legal brief, calling the single impeachment article “unconstitutional for a variety of reasons, any of which alone would be grounds for immediate dismissal.” But according to Rep. Adam Schiff, there is precedent for late impeachment. It’s just in…British history.  In a thread on Twitter, the former lead impeachment manager attempted to make...
__label__2 In Texas abortion cases, hints of new Supreme Court transparencyAs it hears two key cases and wades deeper into what’s poised to be a scrutinized term, the U.S. high court appears also to be more responsive to a public call for greater transparency. In a marathon three hours of oral arguments today, the United States Supreme Court continued its rapid handling of a controversial Texas law that effectively outlaws abortion in the state. The constitutional right to abortion is not at issue, but two cases brought in front of the court at breakneck speed still raise significant questions about...

The mob breached the building and forced lawmakers to evacuate, and five people died in the ensuing riot and its aftermath.
__label__2 Sotomayor: SCOTUS oral arguments changed in part because female justices were interruptedSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday that changes in the format of oral arguments were made in part after research showed that female justices were interrupted more by male justices and advocates, CNN reports. Driving the news: Sotomayor said the studies, including one published in 2017, have had an "enormous impact" and caused Chief Justice John Roberts to be "much more sensitive" to people being interrupted on the court, per CNN. "Most of the time women say things and they are not heard in the same way as men who might say the...
__label__5 Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit MeetingPresident Trump falsely accused The New York Times on Saturday of making up a source in an article about North Korea, even though the source was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room.
__label__3 Save the Constitution From Big TechOPINIONFacebook and Twitter banned President Trump and numerous supporters after last week’s disgraceful Capitol riot, and Google, Apple and Amazon blocked Twitter alternative Parler—all based on claims of “incitement to violence” and “hate speech.” Silicon Valley titans cite their ever-changing “terms of service,” but their selective enforcement suggests political motives. Conventional wisdom holds that technology companies are free to regulate content because they are private, and the First Amendment protects only against government censorship. That view is wrong: Google, Facebook and Twitter should be treated as state actors under existing...
__label__2 Abortion, religion, gun rights on agenda as Supreme Court starts new termThe Supreme Court begins a new nine-month term on Monday, with major cases on abortion, religion and gun rights on the docket. Driving the news: It will be the first in-person session with most of the justices since the pandemic forced proceedings to be held virtually last year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 but has no symptoms, will participate remotely this week, the court said on Friday. Here's a look at some of the biggest cases the court will hear: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization: In one of the most-anticipated cases this term,...

__label__3 The Left Doesn’t Fear Amy Coney Barrett, It Fears the ConstitutionOPINIONNothing threatens the progressive project more than the existence of a Supreme Court that adheres to the Constitution. It’s really that simple. That’s what the tantrum over Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation is all about. The notion that the same Democrats who shelved the judicial filibuster and now threaten to destroy the separation of powers with a Court-packing revenge scheme — the same people, incidentally, so fond of smear-drenched confirmation hearings — are sticklers for process or decorum is simply ludicrous. For one thing, no norms have been undone by...
__label__2 The one case that could define the Supreme Court’s term – and legacyIs the law really the law, if change in personnel results in dramatic change? That’s the question Americans are grappling with as a momentous Supreme Court term opens this week. Justice Clarence Thomas, now the most senior member of the United States Supreme Court, admits he’s never been one to regularly hype the court.  “I’m quite content not to get out on the road,” he said last month, recalling a conversation years ago when his late colleague Justice Antonin Scalia encouraged him to get out “and fly the flag.” It...

There is no shortage of polls or pundits predicting the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But “outcomes” include more than simply election results. Who is gaming out how America — and the world — will respond? We are. While national polls suggest an edge for former Vice President Joe Biden, the winner isn’t determined by national polls. It is determined by who...

__label__2 What's Next for the Eviction Moratorium? Progressives Eye Legislation After SCOTUS RulingHouse progressives are now eyeing legislation to reinstate the federal eviction moratorium after the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's ban. Representative Cori Bush, who slept outside on the U.S. Capitol for several nights in order to push officials to extend the moratorium past its July 30 expiration, said Thursday that lawmakers must take action to protect tenants. "We were outside the Capitol for 5 days. Rain. Heat. Cold. If they think this partisan ruling is going to stop us from fighting to keep people housed, they're wrong," Bush wrote on Twitter.

__label__1 Supreme Court Blocks Biden Administration’s New Eviction MoratoriumThe Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the latest federal ban on evictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, siding with landlords against a moratorium the Biden administration imposed this month despite questions about its legality. Three liberal justices dissented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly renewed the eviction moratorium for millions of tenants affected by the pandemic, in large part to allow them to remain in their homes as state and local governments struggle to disburse some $47 billion of rental assistance provided by Congress. The current order was set to expire Oct. 3;...

__label__3 How ‘Weaponizing’ Mail-In Ballots Could Create Constitutional CrisisThe ongoing process of “weaponizing and abusing mail-in voting” could lead to an “unprecedented constitutional crisis” because of lack of reliability and the potential for fraud, a new report from two House Republicans contends.  Earlier this year, all mail-in balloting in a Democratic primary for a House seat in New York led to six weeks of dispute before a winner was determined. In another case, officials rejected 1 in 5 ballots as fraudulent in a Paterson, New Jersey, election.  “This expansive and late shift to all-mail voting will...
__label__2 The Supreme Court Injects Partisan Politics Into Independent AgenciesIf you think that government experts should be free from political influence, then think again. Twice this June the Supreme Court ruled that the president could exert more control over regulatory agencies, the government institutions that are as important as they sound boring. While Congress may write laws, agencies are needed to interpret them, apply them, and fill in their gaps. Take the government's efforts to address lead poisoning. Congress passed a statute in 1971, and since then, a suite of agencies has issued regulations that keep up with the...

__label__2 How conservative is the new Supreme Court majority, really?The Supreme Court began its summer recess last week, bringing an end to a term that served as the first test of its new 6-3 conservative majority, with all three of former President Donald Trump's appointees on the bench. During Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the final weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Democrats warned — and some Republicans hoped — that a court dominated by conservatives would be primed to radically rewrite the nation’s laws on a host of major issues through...

__label__2 Supreme Court strikes down disclosure rules for political donorsThe Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a California law that required nonprofits to hand over a list of their biggest donors. Why it matters: Some campaign-finance advocates have feared the court will begin chipping away at disclosure rules more broadly, making it harder and harder to figure out who’s funding major political causes. The big picture: In a 6-3 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court said California had subjected donors to the threat of public harassment and intimidation, undermining their First Amendment right to free association. Background: California requires nonprofit organizations...
__label__4 Kim Jong Un invited South Korean president to North Korea, Seoul saysSouth Korea said Saturday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a summit meeting in the North.

Why it matters: Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, but has other warming impacts too. It accounts for 11% of U.S. transportation-related emissions, according to the White House. Those emissions are projected to rise a lot in coming decades alongside the growth of air travel, absent aggressive adoption of climate-friendly tech. In a hypothetical case of technology frozen in place, the strategy...

__label__2 The magic 1.5: What’s behind climate talks’ key elusive goalANALYSISOne phrase, really just a number, dominates climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland: The magic and elusive 1.5. That stands for the international goal of trying to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. It’s a somewhat confusing number in some ways that wasn’t a major part of negotiations just seven years ago and was a political suggestion that later proved to be incredibly important scientifically. Stopping warming at 1.5 or so can avoid or at least lessen some of the most catastrophic future climate change harms...

Core parts of President Joe Biden’s climate plan have crumbled in the face of Washington political realities.

Doing so means replacing carbon-heavy power sources, like coal and gas, with green-energy solutions. Renewables like solar, wind and hydroelectric power will certainly play a major role. But environmentalists, scientists and lawmakers are divided on whether or not nuclear power should be part of a clean-energy future. In the 1980s, nuclear power provided about 17 percent of the world’s energy. But high-profile disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl led many countries to stop investing...

The ballclub announced the name change Friday — effective at the end of the 2021 season — with a video on Twitter narrated by actor and team fan Tom Hanks, ending months of internal discussions triggered by a national reckoning by institutions and teams to permanently drop logos and names considered racist. "You see, there's always been 'Cleveland' — that's the best part of our name," Hanks said in the Twitter video, "and now it's time to unite as...
__label__3 House GOP urges Dems to delay $3.5T spending package amid domestic, foreign woesHouse Republicans urged Democrats on Tuesday to postpone consideration of President Biden’s $3.5 trillion expansion of America’s social safety net, arguing that Congress instead should address the nation’s mounting foreign and domestic woes. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, said Democratic leaders were putting the spending package above the interests of the country. Mr. Westerman made the argument in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva of Arizona. “America is facing crises both...
__label__2 In New Mexico, a wildlife refuge with urban rootsFrom her office in the visitor center at the still-under-construction Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, Jennifer Owen-White has a perfect view of the fuel terminals and salvage yards that dot the horizon.  One day soon, there will be wetlands, trails, and saltgrass meadows in the foreground. But those fuel tanks and junked cars will still loom like a storm cloud in the distance, an “important reminder,” says Ms. Owen-White, of “what my job is and why this refuge exists.” Valle de Oro represents something of a new dawn for...
__label__5 Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony features Naomi Osaka, blue humans and Tongan flag-bearerThe Tokyo Olympics officially kicked off in a virtually empty stadium Friday night after a yearlong delay due to the pandemic. As the Games face the ongoing threat of Covid-19, with the Japanese capital under a state of emergency and many of the country's residents adamantly opposed to hosting the Olympics at all, viewers were still treated to the night's festivities that marked the beginning of the world sporting event. Follow NBC News' Olympics coverage throughout the Games But instead of the 68,000-capacity crowd cheering as athletes from more than 200 countries paraded with flags through Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium, fewer...
__label__3 House Passes $3.5 Trillion Budget Blueprint, Paving Way for Massive Government ExpansionThe House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint, laying the groundwork for a massive expansion of social safety net and climate programs. A compromise between Democratic leaders and a group of moderates led the House to vote on a rule to advance both the budget deal and a separate $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. The rule’s passage approved the budget resolution, allowing the House to bypass a separate vote, and also directs the chamber to take up the bipartisan bill by September 27. Moderate and progressive...
__label__2 Solar panels make money in rural America. They don’t always make friends.Before the end of the year, a colossal, 1,800-acre solar farm will begin delivering its full stream of power from farm fields west of Flint, Michigan. It’s the largest solar installation in the state, by far, and a key driver toward Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal to decarbonize the Midwestern state’s electrical grid, which is still dominated by coal.  The problem with the project: Many locals hate it.  “We’re sick of these ridiculous-looking panels. We don’t like them,” says Jim Sheridan. He lives across the road from the installation in...
__label__4 Tokyo 2020 Reporters Say They’ve Been Forced Into Hotel Isolation Without FoodFor sports reporters, being sent to cover the Olympic Games is the kind of dream assignment that makes them choose their careers in the first place. But the trip to Tokyo instantly descended into boring chaos for a group of journalists forced into isolation days before the Games begin. Multiple reporters have complained that they’re being made to isolate after being exposed to the coronavirus on their voyage to Japan. They say that they’ve been ordered to undergo 14 days of self-isolation in their hotel rooms, so will miss the majority of the Games...
__label__3 They Don't Have The Votes: The Far Left's $3.5 Trillion Boondoggle Is on Life SupportANALYSISThe Afghanistan fiasco has put a major Biden initiative on life support: the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. This is the so-called human infrastructure bill that is pretty much a lefty goodie bag. No, it is—it’s a Happy Meal of communism. This bill, plus the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure package is about to be blown up as Democrats’ intraparty warfare has become increasingly ugly. They don’t have the votes to advance these packages right now. Senate Republicans and maybe some House GOP members might be persuaded on the bipartisan bill, even...
__label__1 Biden's carbon emissions-cutting pledge faces tough climbANALYSISThe verdict is in: President Biden's U.S. emissions-cutting pledge isn't a fantasy, but the path to meeting it is very difficult and relies on forces outside of White House control. Driving the news: The Rhodium Group just released an analysis of policy combinations that could close the gap between the current U.S. trajectory and Biden's vow under the Paris Agreement to cut emissions in half by 2030. Why it matters: It's the most detailed analysis I've seen of what's needed to translate the pledge into policy specifics — and it's quite a lot. It...
__label__4 Nationals-Padres game suspended after three wounded in shooting outside Nationals Park in Washington D.C.Saturday night's game between the San Diego Padres and Washington Nationals was suspended after a shooting outside Nationals Park, the team announced.  The shooting occurred outside the third base gate, the team and D.C. Metro Police said, halting play in the sixth inning and leading to moments of panic inside and outside the stadium.  Three people were wounded in the shooting, according to the MPD, and gunshots were audible from within Nationals Park, sowing confusion among fans, players and stadium employees.  After the gunshots rang out, players from the Padres summoned family...
__label__3 Republicans Celebrate Flip of Dem-Held Seat in Connecticut State SenateRepublicans flipped a state legislature seat in Connecticut on Tuesday night, in a huge victory in a district President Joe Biden won by over 25 percent in the 2020 election. Republican Ryan Fazio decisively defeated Democrat Alex Gevanter in the state’s 36th Senate District and ended the state Senate’s Democratic supermajority. Earlier this year, Republicans also held a battleground state House seat in Connecticut. Fazio's victory represents Americans' unfavorable view of the the Biden administration's policies, the Republican National Committee (RNC) said. “Republicans coalesced in support of State Senator-elect Ryan Fazio and...
__label__2 Clean tech could be worth more than oil by 2030ANALYSISGlobal investment in clean energy technologies is still far below where it needs to be for the world to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to a major new report from the International Energy Agency. To close the gap, annual investment for the rest of this decade needs to be three times higher than it was in 2021. The size of this gap has two important implications. First, for every year that goes by without a significant scale-up in investment, the gap for future years will be even greater, and the odds...
__label__5 Denver police arrest 4 on weapon and drug charges near site of MLB All-Star Game eventsFour people have been arrested and more than a dozen weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition have been seized at a downtown Denver hotel that is close to several events planned in conjunction with the upcoming Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Officers responding to a tip searched two rooms at the Maven Hotel, a block from Coors Field, on Friday night.

__label__3 US admits Pentagon doesn’t know how to defend against China’s hypersonic missilesU.S. military forces “don’t know how to defend” against China and Russia’s most advanced missile systems, a senior U.S. diplomat has acknowledged.This comes after a shocking report that China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile earlier this year. The Chinese government has disputed the report, claiming they were testing a spacecraft instead.
__label__2 Ford announces $11.4bn investment in electric vehicle plantsFord has announced a major investment in electric vehicle (EV) production in the US, promising to build its biggest ever factory in Tennessee, and two battery parks in Kentucky. Under the $11.4bn (£8.3bn) plan, the carmaker said it will build zero-emission cars and pickups "at scale" for American customers. It will also create 11,000 jobs. Like rivals GM and Stellantis, Ford hopes around half of the cars it sells by 2030 will be zero emission. Yet the additional government investment required to make it happen is still in question....
__label__4 The Olympics are stuck in the 1980s on marijuanaWhat would have happened if Sha’Carri Richardson were suspended from the Olympics for marijuana use in the 1980s? In the era of Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” mantra, as the country barreled further into its war on drugs, much of the public likely would have backed the move to block the sprinter from competing after a failed drug test. Politicians on the right and left, many of whom worked together to enact punitive anti-drug laws, would have said the suspension sends the right message to the public about the dangers...
__label__3 Department of Defense, military personnel now subject to automated 'continuous vetting' programThe vetting process for military and Department of Defense personnel is now "continuous" as it applies to checks for security clearance approval. The building of this effort is mostly waiting on the computer hardware side to fully catch up. Official lingo from the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) shortens "continuous vetting" to CV in their promotional material. It’s there the public learns that the Trusted Workforce 2.0 program intended to carry this CV process out was first launched in March 2018. It has been under development since then, with the...
__label__2 China vows end to building coal-fired power plants abroadChinese President Xi Jinping told the UN General Assembly Tuesday that his country "will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad" and plans to boost support for clean energy in developing nations. Why it matters: The pledge, if maintained, would mark a breakthrough in efforts to transition global power away from the most carbon-emitting fuel. Nations, including the U.S., have been urging China — historically a key source of coal-plant finance — to make such a commitment. Xi's pledge on coal financing comes just weeks before a critical UN climate summit....
__label__4 Did Michael Phelps Test Positive for Marijuana and Still Compete in Olympics?FACT CHECKIn July 2021, American track and field star Sha’Carri Richardson was suspended for one month and disqualified from the 2021 Olympic Games after she tested positive for THC, a psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. While many social media users criticized the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for even testing for a drug that is now legal in many states and is being used as medication with increased frequency, others drew a comparison between Richardson and another Olympic athlete, Michael Phelps, who was supposedly allowed to compete despite also testing positive for marijuana. But Phelps did not...
__label__2 Biden Admits to Supreme Court: The ‘Forever War’ Is Not Over, After AllOPINIONTo the extent President Biden’s pull-out from Afghanistan was not criminally negligent, it was pervasively mendacious. There was the president’s lamebrained targeting of September 11 as the withdrawal deadline — a strategic and propaganda boon for the Taliban. There was the stunningly backward plan to draw down forces before evacuating civilians and diplomats, which led to the mind-blowing Bagram bug-out. Thus the domino effect of U.S. mistakes: our inability to evacuate from a fortified, well-equipped airport, instead shifting operations to the impractical Kabul airport; our removal of the technical support (especially air support) that the Afghan...
__label__1 In Response to Climate Change, Citizens in Advanced Economies Are Willing To Alter How They Live and WorkA new Pew Research Center survey in 17 advanced economies spanning North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region finds widespread concern about the personal impact of global climate change. Most citizens say they are willing to change how they live and work at least some to combat the effects of global warming, but whether their efforts will make an impact is unclear. Citizens offer mixed reviews of how their societies have responded to climate change, and many question the efficacy of international efforts to stave off a global environmental crisis....
__label__4 And the crowd goes … silent? How no cheering could impact Olympic performanceFormer U.S. Olympic swimmer Tara Kirk Sell was in Russia to compete in the World Cup swimming circuit in 2006 and remembers the Moscow crowd’s reaction when her name was announced just before she dove into the pool. “It was dead silent,” Kirk Sell said. Athletes taking part in the Tokyo Olympics this year are also likely to hear crickets when they compete because the Japanese organizers and the International Olympic Committee, concerned about containing the pandemic, are limiting the number of spectators to no more than 10,000 in the venues.

__label__3 Milley Says Calls to Chinese General Were ‘Perfectly’ Within His Job DutiesFaced with calls to resign or an investigation, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley on Friday defended two phone calls he allegedly made in secret to his Chinese Communist Party counterpart. The general reached out to Gen. Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army several days before the November 2020 election and two days after the Capitol breach on Jan. 6 to reassure the Chinese army that an attack isn’t incoming, according to excerpts of a book that was published this week. Milley, the top U.S. general, described the two phone...
__label__2 Tariffs to Tackle Climate Change Gain Momentum. The Idea Could Reshape Industries.ANALYSISGovernments in the U.S., Europe and other developed nations are embarking on a climate change experiment: using tariffs on trade to cut carbon emissions. The idea has the potential to rewrite the rules of global commerce.Policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic are looking at targeting steel, chemicals and cement. The tariffs would give a competitive advantage to manufacturers in countries where emissions are relatively low.

__label__3 Money Down The Toilet In AfghanistanOPINIONThis sign of American decadence and stupidity in Afghanistan cannot be improved on. The Spectator columnist Cockburn reports on America’s attempt to turn a nation of medieval goat herders and Islamic hillbillies into penis-possessors and vulva-havers suitable for campus life at some of America’s more elite colleges. Excerpts: So, alongside the billions for bombs went hundreds of millions for gender studies in Afghanistan. According to US government reports, $787 million was spent on gender programs in Afghanistan, but that substantially understates the actual total, since gender goals were folded into practically every undertaking...
__label__2 Should Democrats have embraced the billionaire tax?As congressional Democrats ironed out the details of their ambitious social spending and infrastructure package, the lawmakers considered a novel proposal for paying for it: a billionaire tax. But shortly after the idea was raised, it was axed thanks to opposition among key party members, specifically Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The proposed tax was designed to close pathways that have allowed a small number of the country’s richest people to accumulate enormous wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate than most working Americans. Under current law, assets like stocks are subject to...
__label__4 Rising U.S. Track Star Sha’Carri Richardson Tests Positive for Marijuana, Could Miss Tokyo OlympicsAmerican sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who was set to be a breakout star at the Olympic Games later this month, has tested positive for marijuana, putting her participation in the Tokyo games in doubt. The 21-year-old, sporting bright orange hair and an electric personality, roared to victory in the women’s 100-meter sprint at the U.S. Olympic trials, making her a fan favorite as well as a favorite to win gold. The positive test taken at the trials last month means Richardson will likely face a competition ban of some length; the sanction for...
__label__3 Taliban throws victory parade with US military equipmentThe Taliban are now brazenly showing off the US military equipment — including Black Hawk helicopters, dozens of armored vehicles and weapons — abandoned by US troops amid President Biden’s chaotic final exit from Afghanistan. Islamist fighters staged victory parades Wednesday in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-biggest city, as they showed off the US military hardware they’ve now seized. Videos showed heavily-armed Taliban fighters standing on top of a long line of captured Humvees and other tactical vehicles, as they drove along a highway. In embarrassing scenes for the US, a Black Hawk helicopter even...
__label__1 Democrats' billionaires tax explainedANALYSISThere is now legislative language behind the push to tax American billionaires on unrealized capital gains, as Sen. Ron Wyden last night released his 107-page plan. Why it matters: This would be a sea change in U.S. tax policy, which has only applied to realized gains (otherwise known as income). Wyden's proposal would apply to those with more than $1 billion in assets or more than $100 million in adjusted gross income over three consecutive years. The biggest tax bills would come up front, charging a long-term cap gains rates on all...
__label__5 Viral image misrepresents photo of transgender high school wrestlerANALYSISA years-old image showing a man pinning a female opponent during a high school wrestling match has resurfaced on Facebook in recent months, with commentary that creates a misleading impression of what the photo depicts. "They are not courageous transgender athletes," the overlay text on the photo reads. "They are just boys beating up on girls." The post was shared to Facebook on May 23 and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. The wrestler is Mack Beggs, who is a transgender...
__label__3 US Military Allegedly Blocked American Citizens From Entering Kabul Airport, Top GOP Senator Demands To Know WhyThe top Republican member on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations demanded the Biden administration address a report that a U.S. military commander blocked a group of 25 American citizens from entering the Kabul airport. Former Force Recon Marine Chad Robichaux told the Daily Caller News Foundation that his nonprofit organization had organized bus transport to the Kabul airport for 100 Christians, 300 orphans and 25 American citizens early Thursday morning. But when the evacuees arrived at the airport, Robichaux said a “military commander” made a scene and made the evacuees leave...
__label__2 U.S. Senate Democrat unveils 'billionaires tax' for Biden agendaU.S. billionaires would pay tax on unrealized gains from their assets to help finance President Joe Biden's emerging social-policy and climate-change legislation, according to a proposal unveiled on Wednesday by the top Senate Democrat for tax policy. The so-called billionaires tax, announced by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, is part of a two-pronged legislative strategy that also includes a proposed 15% corporate minimum tax on the most profitable U.S. corporations, which was unveiled on Tuesday. Wyden and other lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, say the legislation is intended to curtail...

Moulton tweeted that the two lawmakers visited Kabul airport on Tuesday "to conduct oversight on the evacuation." "We came into this visit wanting, like most veterans, to push the president to extend the August...
__label__2 Democrats Weigh Tax Alternatives to Fund $2 Trillion PackageDemocrats worked to quickly find new sources of revenue to pay for their roughly $2 trillion social-policy and climate package, seeking to target businesses and wealthy individuals in novel ways after proposed rate increases ran aground in talks. The continued opposition by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) to any increases in top marginal rates on corporations, individuals or capital gains has emerged as a major hurdle in the party’s quest to reach a new framework on the legislation. A person familiar with Ms. Sinema’s thinking said she has agreed to enough alternative...
__label__5 Biden White House Is Preparing to Confront States on Anti-Trans BillsANALYSISThe Biden administration is preparing to directly confront the rash of anti-LGBT, and specifically anti-trans bills proliferating in state legislatures, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the country’s leading LGBTQ advocacy organization. Separately, the Department of Justice has told The Daily Beast it will “fully enforce our civil rights statutes to protect transgender individuals,” giving hope to campaigners that the DOJ is preparing to challenge in the courts the legality of bills that have been introduced—and some passed—in a number of states, outlawing transgender youth’s access to health care...
__label__3 Military pledges evacuation of 'all' Americans from Afghanistan but admits US can't grab 'large numbers'Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.

__label__2 Could Legislation Give the IRS the Power to Track Transactions on Any Bank Account With More Than $600?FACT CHECKA number of viral social media posts have claimed that Congress is attempting to pass a bill that would give the Internal Revenue Service the power to track all financial transactions coming to and from bank accounts with more than $600.  The claim is largely accurate: A proposal from the Treasury Department suggests “a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime” to crack down on tax evasion, and would require banks to report the gross inflows and outflows of all accounts for which the total cash flow exceeds $600. In other words, it does not matter if the...
__label__5 Was the State Department Charging Americans $2K for Flights out of Afghanistan?FACT CHECKClaim: Per an Aug. 14, 2021 notice, the State Department was charging $2,000 or more for repatriation flights for U.S. citizens from Kabul airport after the Taliban takeover.Rating: TrueContext: After news of the costs of repatriation flights gained traction online resulting in outrage, the State Department changed the rule, saying they would no longer be charging citizens for the cost of taking a charter flight out of Afghanistan.

__label__3 Intel Agencies Warned of Afghan Collapse as Biden Publicly Downplayed PossibilityU.S. intelligence agencies warned of the collapse of the Afghan military and government at the hands of a resurgent Taliban over the summer, as President Biden publicly downplayed the possibility of a government rout. While Biden assured Americans on July 8 that the Afghan regime’s disintegration was far from inevitable, quieting fears of a “Saigon-like” foreign policy fiasco, previous intelligence reports indicated that Afghan security forces as well as the seat of government in Kabul were weakening and could falter, current and former American government officials told the New York Times.

The group of developed nations agreed to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. This marks a huge shift for smaller economies, such as the Republic of Ireland, which have attracted international firms — to a large extent — via a lower tax rate. “The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of...
__label__4 Biden Preparing to Declare That Atrocities Against Armenia Were GenocideMore than a century after the Ottoman Empire’s killing of an estimated 1.5 million Armenian civilians, President Biden is preparing to declare that the atrocities were an act of genocide, according to officials familiar with the internal debate. The action would signal that the American commitment to human rights outweighs the risk of further fraying the U.S. alliance with Turkey. Mr. Biden is expected to announce the symbolic designation on Saturday, the 106th anniversary of the beginning of what historians call a yearslong and systematic death march that the predecessors...
__label__3 Pentagon Refuses To Answer Question On Taliban Obtaining US Weaponry, EquipmentThe Department of Defense evaded a question about whether it is acting to prevent the Taliban from obtaining U.S. weapons in Afghanistan. A top U.S. military official said he doesn’t “have information” about an effort to seize military equipment the U.S. gave to the fallen Afghanistan government and has since been taken by Taliban insurgents, during a press briefing Monday. Major General Hank Taylor, the U.S. Strategic Command chief of staff, repeatedly evaded questions about the Taliban potentially obtaining scores of U.S. technology. “I don’t have the answer to that question,” Taylor said...

You could get one of four kinds of letters: CP 11, CP 12, CP 13, or letter 6470. None of them is likely to contain good news. The Taxpayer Advocate Service says 9 million Americans have gotten notices from the IRS that say the government is billing them for payment due to a “math error.” 7.4 million of the errors were due to pandemic-era stimulus overpayments. But wait, there’s more. Financial experts...
__label__5 Blinken visits Afghanistan after Biden's withdrawal decision to press for diplomacyLess than a day after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken made his first visit to the country as he pushes to reignite diplomatic efforts for a deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government.Arriving in Kabul Thursday, Blinken met President Ashraf Ghani and other senior officials amid fears the government faces an imminent offensive by the militant group that has sought to establish an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan.

__label__2 The wealthy may avoid $163 billion in taxes every year. Here’s how they do itThe wealthiest Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in income taxes every year, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and many leverage tax laws to do it legally, financial experts say. Although U.S. levies increase with income, the ultra-wealthy often finesse the tax code to reduce how much they owe. And some billionaires, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, pay little to no taxes compared to their wealth, a ProPublica report found.  “As long as you’re adhering to the law, everything’s fair game,” said certified...

"We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's borders since 2014," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday after flying to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. "That is a deep concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States." In a call with...

The Arkansas Republican made his comments in a column for Fox News on Tuesday. "Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are monopolistic technology corporations that dominate a greater market share in their fields than any similar firms in American history," he said. "While size alone isn’t a problem, these firms have used their extraordinary wealth and power to buy up rivals, stifle competition and muzzle speech that they oppose.

__label__1 Top 1% dodge $163 billion in annual taxes, Treasury estimatesThe top 1% of Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in annual taxes, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  This estimate widens the so-called tax gap — the shortfall between how much is owed and collected — to $600 billion every year, the report outlines. The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...
__label__4 U.S., allies announce sanctions on China over Uyghur ‘genocide’The United States and its allies in Canada, Britain and the European Union on Monday announced sanctions on several Chinese officials alleged to have links to what U.S. officials say is a genocidal campaign against Uyghur Muslims. The international, coordinated sanctions, first reported by POLITICO, drew condemnation and some immediate retaliatory sanctions from Beijing. The moves offered a glimpse into the growing divide between China and the United States and its trans-Atlantic allies, which, like Washington, are increasingly wary of China’s global ambitions and internal repression.

On July 15, cash flowed into the bank accounts of parents across the U.S. as the government rolled out the first monthly payments of the enhanced child tax credit passed by Congress this spring. But as helpful as those payments are to a lot of families, they could actually create headaches for others, with some people owing money to the government next year. As a result, some parents have already opted out of the monthly payments and are instead choosing to receive the...
__label__5 The U.S. and China Finally Get Real With Each OtherANALYSISThursday night’s very public dustup between United States and Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, during the Biden administration’s first official meeting with China, may have seemed like a debacle, but the exchange was actually a necessary step to a more stable relationship between the two countries. In his brief opening remarks before the press, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan would discuss “our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, and...

Mr. Trump twice rejected sending a draft letter that had been prepared by an acting assistant attorney general recommending some state legislatures reject the public vote tallies and send a different slate of electors, the Republican staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded. The former president also rejected the idea of...
__label__2 Four ways in which Biden’s new child tax credit will impact inequalityThe US federal government’s $1.9 trillion relief package that President Joe Biden signed on March 11 will temporarily expand the child tax credit. This credit, currently pegged at up to $2,000 a year per child until they turn 17, will instead total $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for kids up to the age of 18 over the next 12 months. Starting in July, the Internal Revenue Service will distribute half this money to most families with children in monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child. The IRS will deliver the balance...
__label__4 U.S. to resettle more child refugees fleeing violence around the worldAs part of its overhaul of U.S. refugee policy, the Biden administration is planning to offer humanitarian refuge to more children fleeing violence around the world, according to a government report obtained by CBS News. The report, prepared by the State Department to notify the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of President Biden's proposal to increase admissions of refugees, committed the U.S. to resettling more unaccompanied refugee minors going forward.

Todd Young warned the few dozen conservatives gathered this month in the basement of a sushi restaurant that their activism could be the only thing to stop Congress from spending trillions of dollars of tax money. “You flooding the zone with your concerns will amplify for members just how serious they are,” the Indiana Republican said. After Mr. Young’s remarks, his audience talked among themselves about school-board meetings and the state’s coronavirus rules.

It was my fault,” he said. “They started committing suicide when we got home pretty quick.” McDaniel dealt with alcohol abuse, divorce, and severe depression before finding help; he now works for a non-profit organization that assists veterans who are dealing with trauma. Many of his fellow veterans, however, haven’t...
__label__2 Meet The Tea Party's New Favorite CandidateConservatives have found their candidate for one of 2016's most important Senate races: Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis. Soon after he launched his bid Wednesday, a trifecta of deep-pocketed Tea Party-aligned groups — the Senate Conservatives Fund, the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks — all signaled they would back the two-term congressman in his bid to succeed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who's running for president. Florida is an important state in 2016 for many reasons. It will not only be a crucial part of any White House campaign, but it will...

__label__4 Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, Said There Will Be a 'Smooth Transition' to a Trump Second TermSecretary of State Mike Pompeo just became the latest high-ranking Republican official to insist, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, that President Trump didn’t actually lose the 2020 election. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” Pompeo said in  a briefing on Tuesday. Pompeo’s wild-eyed departure from reality comes as Trump continues to insist that Biden’s victory depends on widespread fraud, a claim that so far has not been borne out by any legitimate source.
__label__3 On Memorial Day, Remember Skepticism Toward a Large, Standing MilitaryOPINIONIn recent years, it's become common to thank both retired and active-duty military personnel for their service – an expression met with various measures of appreciation or discomfort by recipients. The new custom is a step beyond the long-established sentiments embodied by Memorial Day, which acknowledges those who fell in combat in the ranks of a rare American institution that retains wide public confidence. While the thank-yous are well-intentioned, they represent a shift in attitude for a country that once distrusted anything resembling a powerful military. They also gloss over the costs—acknowledged on...

Common Cause, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices effectively abolished constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering. But don’t worry about it, Chief Justice John Roberts told the country: You, the citizens, can fix this problem yourselves! States “are actively addressing the issue on a number of fronts,” Roberts promised, and Congress isn’t far behind. “The avenue for reform established by the Framers,” he assured readers, “and used by Congress in the past, remains open.” Two years later, this passage reads like a twisted joke....

__label__1 Boehner Fights Back Against Tea Party, AgainA high-stakes drama played out over the debt ceiling on Capitol Hill this week. It ended with President Obama getting exactly what he'd asked for — an extension of the Treasury's borrowing authority with no strings attached — and an even wider gulf between GOP congressional leaders and Tea Party-aligned conservatives. Underlying the Republican rift was House Speaker John Boehner's determination to avoid another episode like last fall's government shutdown. Boehner initially tried adding one sweetener after another to a debt limit extension, but none managed to get enough fellow...

Bruen, a major Second Amendment case before the Supreme Court, is that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared open to many of New York state’s arguments defending its restrictions on where individuals may carry a gun. Even if Barrett does side with New York, however, her vote is unlikely to matter. Four justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — left little doubt that they will read the Second...

The office of Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, said on Friday that she and Republican Tom Cotton had introduced a bill targeting such companies as Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. The bill would make it easier for the government to stop deals it believes break antitrust law by requiring the companies to prove to a judge that the deals are good...
__label__5 Majority of Supreme Court appears to think N.Y. gun law is too restrictiveA majority of Supreme Court justices indicated Wednesday that they believe Americans generally have a right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense and that a New York law requiring special justification for getting such a permit is too restrictive. But it was unclear from a two-hour argument in the case how much more the court was willing to do to clarify the Second Amendment. Several expressed concern about allowing those with concealed weapons in sensitive areas, such as stadiums, crowded public events or places were alcohol is...

The order, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from, leaves intact a decision earlier this month by a federal appeals court that revived the law, SB 8, two days after a judge in Austin blocked it. It means that healthcare providers in Texas will remain barred from performing nearly all...

But an even more explosive debate has broken out on a question once believed unthinkable: Should — and will — rank-and-file troops obey the commander in chief if they’re ordered to round up American citizens on the streets of New York, Louisville, or Chicago? Some prominent veterans and lawmakers on Capitol Hill already are calling on service members to “lay down your arms”...

Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that protects a person’s right to access abortion without excessive government restrictions. Now, as the court’s inaction has allowed a Texas law to come in effect that essentially bans abortion at six weeks and empowers abortion opponents to be “vigilantes,” the media’s actions will stand in history as a flagrant collapse of competent reporting. On September 1, the...

The two actions reflect the fraught relationship between President Joe Biden and the conservative-dominated bench. The combined moves also demonstrate a flexing of ideological, if not political, muscle, even as the justices regularly declare themselves above partisanship. The Biden administration is facing multiple legal challenges in lower courts to its immigration, economic...

That policy, which is officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), requires many immigrants who seek asylum in the United States to stay in Mexico while they await a hearing. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s opinion in Texas was wrong for many reasons, including that he completely misread federal immigration law....

The Big Apple mayor-elect doubled down on his campaign promise to reinstate the NYPD’s plainclothes unit a day after New York Black Lives Matter leader Hawk Newsome threatened “riots,” “fire” and “bloodshed” should Adams follow through on the move. “I made it clear on the campaign trail,” Adams said on CNN Thursday morning, a day after the heated meeting with Newsome at Brooklyn Borough Hall. “I’m going to put in place not the Anti-Crime Unit, I’m going to put in place a plainclothes...
__label__1 Restaurants prep for long-term labor crunch by turning to robots to man the fryer, shuttle food to tablesAt Inspire Brand’s Innovation Center in Atlanta, the Flippy robot is taking on a new challenge. The automated worker, made by Miso Robotics, first came onto the scene as a burger solution. Now, it’s frying wings for the first time. The bots, known as Flippy 1 and 2, have been in development for nearly five years, taking on pilots at brands like CaliBurger and White Castle. The wings iteration is being tested at Inspire’s Buffalo Wild Wings brand as a way to ramp up production and speed. The hope is...
__label__5 The lapsed eviction moratorium is the Supreme Court’s faultOPINIONOn Sunday, a federal eviction moratorium, which was intended to prevent renters from losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic, expired. At its height, this moratorium may have saved as many as 40 million Americans from eviction. But, in late June, the Supreme Court signaled that this moratorium must expire at the end of July, effectively leaving many renters without protection. In theory, most of these renters — and their landlords — should have received federal housing assistance. Over the course of the pandemic, Congress allocated $45 billion in rent...

__label__1 House Lawmakers ask Amazon to prove Bezos and other execs didn't lie to CongressFive members of a congressional committee say Jeff Bezos and other executives misled lawmakers and may have lied under oath, according to a Monday letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Bezos in July. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers is asking Amazon for "exculpatory" evidence in light of news reports about the company's special treatment of its own brands over other sellers' products. The lawmakers, all members of the Judiciary Committee, add they are weighing "whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate." An...
__label__4 Roe v. Wade Is Now in the Hands of the Three Trump JusticesANALYSISOne of the most interesting fissures that has opened up within the conservative legal movement in recent years has been between mainstream conservative lawyers and the growing performance artist faction of the lawyers for the Trump base. Soon, the conservative justices themselves will have to pick which side of the battle they are on: With the filing last week of a brief that explicitly asks the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the state of Mississippi is forcing the court’s three newest Trump-appointed justices to choose between institutional stability and...
__label__3 50th Person In Chicago Charged With Murder Or Attempted Murder While Out On Felony BondEdmond Harris became the 50th person in Chicago arrested this year for allegedly murdering, attempting to murder, or shooting someone while out on felony bond. CWB Chicago reported that Harris was arrested on February 12 “after he allegedly crashed a hijacked SUV in Lawndale.” For some reason, Harris was not charged for any crime related to the carjacking or crash and was instead charged “with failure to register as a sex offender in an unrelated matter.” Still, failing to register is a felony, but Harris was released a few days after his...
__label__1 Microchip shortage: Why US is poised to take rare actionA global shortage of microchips has crimped the availability of cars and other products. It’s also stirring discussion about something longer term: whether the U.S. needs an industrial policy to retain an edge in innovation. The computer chip shortage, which has disrupted supplies of everything from automobiles to wheelchair accessories, is pushing Congress to take big steps in helping America’s high-tech industry. Congress has already passed legislation to encourage semiconductor firms to build chip fabrication facilities, or fabs, in the United States. It has not yet authorized the funding. Not...
__label__5 How America lost its commitment to the right to voteANALYSISThe Supreme Court isn’t even pretending that it’s bound by legal texts in its voting rights cases. The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan lamented in a dissenting opinion earlier this month, “has treated no statute worse” than the Voting Rights Act. She’s right. The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most successful civil rights law in American history. Originally signed in 1965, it was the United States’ first serious attempt since Reconstruction to build a multi-racial democracy — and it worked. Just two years after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting...
__label__3 Austin, Texas, defunded its police department. Now voters will decide if city needs more officersAmid nationwide protests seeking police reforms last summer, the Austin, Texas, city council decided to cut about one-third of its police budget – the largest cut of any major city in America.  Councilman Greg Cesar, a progressive who spearheaded the push to cut funding, said the vote offered a moment to "celebrate what the movement has achieved for safety, racial justice and democracy."  But since the budget cut, Austin has gotten much less safe. According to statistics compiled by the data analysis firm AH Datalytics, the city has seen a nearly 71% increase in...
__label__2 Power shifts from Big Tech as digital crackdowns intensifyInternet freedom around the world has dropped for the 11th consecutive year, according to an annual report from Freedom House, a non-profit focused on expanding freedom and democracy. Why it matters: The findings suggest that a broader shift in power from tech companies to nation states over the past year has resulted in "a record-breaking crackdown" on freedom of expression online. Details: The report finds that government officials in 56 of the 70 countries measured have arrested or convicted people for their speech online. (The 70 countries measured account for 88% of the world's...
__label__4 Trump’s Social Media Lawsuits Feature A Mashup Of Arguments Courts Have Already RejectedFormer president Donald Trump’s latest attempt at getting back on mainstream social media platforms came in the form of lawsuits on Wednesday against Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube — each featuring a series of claims that multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, have rebuffed. Trump was suspended from Facebook and Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 riots at the US Capitol and blocked from YouTube a few days later; all three companies cited posts that encouraged or supported the violence. He’d previously had messages that promoted baseless claims of voter fraud flagged as...
__label__3 Antifa crashes Texas college's pro-life prayer vigil: 'F*ck your God!'On Monday night in Denton, Texas, a pro-life vigil was underway when it was crashed by hundreds of Antifa protestors, who attempted to drown the event out. In the video, the pro-life activists who gathered for the event were chanting "Christ is King," to which the Antifa counter protestors started shouting "F*ck your God." The pro-life prayer vigil was led on campus Monday by the local Young Conservatives of Texas (YCT) chapter at the University of North Texas (UNT). According to Fox News, Kelly Neidert, founder of the YCT chapter at UNT,...
__label__1 The Facebook Files - A Wall Street Journal InvestigationANALYSISFacebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series, based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.  Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer...
__label__5 Samuel Alito’s Boundless Contempt for DemocracyOPINIONI spent my Fourth of July holiday this year like most others did: spending time with friends and family, eating hot dogs and hamburgers, and setting off fireworks. It’s one of my favorite holidays—partly because of my affection for this country and brightly colored explosions, and partly because of its timing. July 4 also usually follows the end of the Supreme Court’s annual term, capping off what are my busiest months at work each year. This year, however, relaxation didn’t come as easily. I found myself instead thinking about the court’s...

__label__1 The Facebook whistleblower says its algorithms are dangerous. Here’s why.On Sunday night, the primary source for the Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files, an investigative series based on internal Facebook documents, revealed her identity in an episode of 60 Minutes. Frances Haugen, a former product manager at the company, says she came forward after she saw Facebook’s leadership repeatedly prioritize profit over safety. Before quitting in May of this year, she combed through Facebook Workplace, the company’s internal employee social media network, and gathered a wide swath of internal reports and research in an attempt to conclusively demonstrate that Facebook had willfully...
__label__5 Supreme Court upholds restrictive Arizona voting laws in test of Voting Rights ActThe Supreme Court on Thursday upheld two election laws in the 2020 battleground state of Arizona that challengers said make it harder for minorities to vote. The case was an important test for what's left of one of the nation's most important civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the Supreme Court scaled back in 2013. A remaining provision allows lawsuits claiming that voting changes would put minority voters at a disadvantage in electing candidates of their choice. Civil rights groups were hoping the Supreme Court would use the Arizona case...
__label__3 The Party of ViolenceOPINIONAdam Smith said, “There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.” It was meant as comfort. A lot can be wrong and still not signal the apocalypse. So let’s hope that the increasing fascination with political violence we are hearing from Republicans is a passing thing, and not a sign of unravelling. A Republican running for Northampton County executive in Pennsylvania gave a heated address on August 29 about mask mandates in schools. Steve Lynch is tired, he said, of providing his school board with arguments and data...
__label__2 Facebook grilled over mental-health impact on kidsFacebook has defended the impact of its products, saying Instagram has "affirmatively helped" young people. Its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, testified to the US Senate, about child protection. It comes after a leak exposed how Instagram's own research had found the platform could harm children’s well-being. Previously, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri said the app's effects on teenagers' mental health were "quite small". Instagram for kids paused after backlash Facebook under fire over secret teen research The committee opened by reiterating Facebook's own research - first reported on by...
__label__5 What Would It Look Like If We Treated Climate Change as an Actual Emergency?OPINIONAs the dust settles on COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the results do not look good. Despite a flurry of headline-grabbing pledges, national commitments bring us nowhere near to meeting the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. According to Climate Action Tracker, 73% of existing “net-zero” pledges are weak and inadequate—“lip service to climate action.” What is more, a yawning gap remains between pledges, which are easy enough to make, and actual policies, which are all that really count. You can pledge all you like, but what we need is action. Right...
__label__3 Kenosha Is A Political Liability For Democrats Because They Lit The Match And Watched It Go Up In FlamesOPINIONLast year's Jacob Blake and Kyle Rittenhouse shootings didn't just change the people of Kenosha; they also changed the politics. It’s been one year since an immigrant watched every vehicle in his car dealership go up in flames, one year since Rode’s Camera Shop became a pile of ashes and the country woke up to learn the name Kyle Rittenhouse after the teen killed two people. A year since businesses frantically tacked “Black Lives Matter” signs onto their storefronts and families spraypainted “Please, kids above” onto boarded-up windows hoping the mob would pass over them —...
__label__2 Facebook exec will testify at Senate hearing after report finds Instagram harms teen mental healthFacebook agreed to send Antigone Davis, global head of safety, to testify before the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection on Sept. 30, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The Washington Post reported the news earlier on Thursday. The hearing comes after The Wall Street Journal published a series of reports detailing internal discussions at Facebook, based on documents it obtained. One of the articles that sparked anger among lawmakers revealed that Facebook conducted research showing its Instagram app had a negative impact on many teenage girls’ mental health, despite testimony from top executives in...
__label__4 Leaders at COP26 Are 'Massively Killing the Paris Agreement,' Critics Say as Talks Drag On Past DeadlineAfter nearly two weeks of negotiations, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland was expected to extend into the weekend Friday as policymakers missed the evening deadline for finalizing their deal on how countries will combat the climate crisis—with leaders unable to come to an agreement thus far regarding financial support for the Global South, fossil fuel subsidies, and other key issues. Hundreds of campaigners representing Indigenous communities, young people, and civil society groups poured into the hallways of the venue where COP26 is taking place, chanting, "Keep...
__label__3 You Don’t Need To Go To Kabul To See The End Of American Order. It’s Right Here Among UsOPINIONIn many of our major cities, gangs of masked thugs and criminals do what they please -- and our far-better-armed police aren't allowed to stop it. The nation’s attention these past two weeks has focused nearly exclusively on Kabul, and rightly so given that the city has become the scene of the largest hostage situation in American history and a vivid image of the decline of Pax Americana abroad. Yet Americans don’t need to travel 7,500 miles to get a first-hand glimpse of the end of American order. In many...
__label__1 When AI breaks badANALYSISA new report about artificial intelligence and its effects warns AI has reached a turning point and its negative effects can no longer be ignored. The big picture: For all the sci-fi worries about ultra-intelligent machines or wide-scale job loss from automation — both of which would require artificial intelligence that is far more capable than what has been developed so far — the larger concern may be about what happens if AI doesn't work as intended. Background: The AI100 project — which was launched by Eric Horvitz, who served as Microsoft's first chief...
__label__5 Countries’ climate pledges built on flawed data, Post investigation findsMalaysia’s latest catalogue of its greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations reads like a report from a parallel universe. The 285-page document suggests that Malaysia’s trees are absorbing carbon four times faster than similar forests in neighboring Indonesia. The surprising claim has allowed the country to subtract over 243 million tons of carbon dioxide from its 2016 inventory — slashing 73 percent of emissions from its bottom line. Across the world, many countries underreport their greenhouse gas emissions in their reports to the United Nations, a Washington Post investigation has found. An examination of...
__label__3 In ‘Deep Blue’ New York, Voters Reject Democrats’ Push for Election ChangesIn one of the bluest states in the nation, voters soundly rejected proposed changes to election law that congressional Democrats are trying to impose nationally.  New York state voters voted “no” on Democrat-supported amendments to the state Constitution, pitched as “voting rights” measures, that would have expanded absentee voting, allowed same-day voter registration, and changed the rules on drawing legislative districts.  Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives this year have passed four bills that were variations of their initial bill, HR 1, dubbed the “For the People Act.” The measures would ban...
__label__1 Lawmakers Push Facebook To Abandon Instagram For Kids, Citing Mental Health ConcernsLawmakers on Capitol Hill are pressing Facebook to abandon its plans to build a version of its Instagram app for kids and demanding the company share research into how Instagram affects teenage users. Renewed scrutiny of Facebook's risks to teenagers' well-being was sparked by a Wall Street Journal story published Tuesday that revealed the social media giant's own research has found Instagram, the photo-sharing app it also owns, is particularly harmful to some teenage girls. On Wednesday, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Reps. Kathy Castor of Florida and Lori Trahan of Massachusetts,...
__label__4 Why some experts say corporate 'net-zero' emissions pledges could have net-zero impact on climate crisisDubbed a "code red for humanity" by the head of the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its most-recent report that the impacts of human-induced climate change are already being seen in "every region across the globe" and urgent action must be taken immediately, not decades into the future, to mitigate the devastation. As scientists sound the alarms, it has become near-impossible for business leaders to ignore the research -- or the global, youth-led protests spurred by activists like Greta Thunberg, who view climate change as an intergenerational justice issue -- as...
__label__3 Voters Are Done With COVID-19 and Pandemic-Powered OfficialsANALYSISPoliticians have been on a high over the last year-plus, wielding extraordinary power with the approval of voters fearful of viral infection. Democrats, in particular, championed draconian restrictions on life and often won praise for doing so. Going into this week's election, Terry McAuliffe, Phil Murphy, and other politicians had every reason to expect voters to cheer similar interventions in other areas. But voters, it turns out, are over their pandemic panic and want something closer to a traditionally restrained government minding its manners and paying attention to the public's...
__label__1 U.S. airstrike kills senior al-Qaeda leader in Syria, DOD saysA U.S. airstrike in northwest Syria on Friday killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. Why it matters: Syria serves as a "safe haven" for the extremist group to plan external operations, according to U.S. Army Maj. John Rigsbee. What they're saying: "The removal of this al-Qaeda senior leader will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out global attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians," Rigsbee said in the statement. U.S. Central Command currently has "no indications of civilian casualties." The...

So asks an advertisement placed in Scotland's largest daily newspaper this week by U.S. environmental and climate justice groups during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, part of an effort to persuade the Biden administration to reject all new gas exports and fossil fuel infrastructure. "The answer is no," the ad says. "Yet right now, 23 liquefied natural gas export terminals and pipelines are sitting on your desks. These projects will unleash greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to doubling all existing...
__label__3 ‘Our Broken Elections’: Who Broke Them and Why, and How to Fix ThemOPINIONElection integrity is a fundamental requirement of a functioning democratic republic. In the freest nation in the world, our system of government and our very liberty depend on free and fair elections. Whether selecting a mayor or the president of the United States, every American must be able to trust the process, or the democratic system itself breaks down. When someone commits election fraud, the process is no longer fair, everyone’s vote gets diluted, and in some cases, election results are changed. Problems can arise not only from intentional misconduct...

One lifeless corpse dangled off a crane above throngs of commuters who were stunned at the exhibition and grasping the significance of the moment—a return to the past. The group’s newly appointed mayor declared the killed as kidnappers and boasted about the display of the dead as an effective deterrent. He warned: Other criminals would meet the same fate.

Drop-box voting, launched by the state’s Democratic-run government in 2020 as part of COVID-19 measures, is a ballot security issue for the state GOP as Virginians decide the razor-close governor’s race between Republican Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Terry McAuliffe. “You have them in secure locations, namely in the registrar’s office, and they’re only accessible to the...

__label__2 How Virginia Democrats Are Working To Make Elections Sloppy AgainOPINIONThis portends poorly for the future of election integrity. It also proves a significant bellwether for our country heading into the 2022 midterm elections. Virginia’s gubernatorial race is seen as a national bellwether. With the most recent polls showing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former underdog, tied with his Democrat rival Terry McAuliffe, the outcome of the Nov. 2, 2021 election seems sure to rest on the smallest of margins. The more important trend for Americans to consider, however, lies not in the tight election, nor even in the party affiliation of the eventual victor,...

World affairs reordered abruptly on that morning of blue skies, black ash, fire and death. In Iran, chants of “death to America” quickly gave way to candlelight vigils to mourn the American dead. Vladimir Putin weighed in with substantive help as the U.S. prepared to go to war in Russia’s region of influence. Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi, a murderous dictator with a poetic streak, spoke of the “human duty” to be...

It’s changing politics, too.Layers of dried mud on sidewalks, concrete roads turned to gravel and time-worn stone bridges washed away. Three months after this summer’s catastrophic floods in Germany’s Ahrweiler region, there are reminders everywhere of the destruction they wrought. The deluge, which was preceded by three consecutive summers of drought, has brought a new urgency for many to find climate change solutions — and that has impacted Germany’s politics, too. In last month’s federal election, the environmentalist Green Party had its best results yet, winning nearly 15 percent of the vote, and trailing just behind the two largest parties....

Just nine months into his term, President Joe Biden has already achieved something only predecessor Donald Trump managed before him: an average approval rating south of 45 percent in the third quarter of his first year. According to an Oct. 1-19 Gallup poll of 832 American adults released today, Biden was at 42 percent overall, down from 57 percent in January.

They have vowed to respect women’s rights to some degree, forgive those who had allied with the U.S. military and prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a staging ground for attacks. “We want the world to trust us,” a Taliban spokesperson said. Unsurprisingly, the notion of a kinder, gentler Taliban has been met with deep...

__label__4 From Soda to Blackouts, A Global Gas Crisis Is Causing HavocChina is experiencing rolling blackouts and factory shutdowns. U.K. soda shelves may soon be empty. Fertilizer plants are shutting down and slaughterhouses are growing wary of how long they can withstand periods without a crucial ingredient they need to keep up meat production.  The common denominator between all of these strained industries is a crucial, yet perhaps unexpected commodity: natural gas.  A confluence of factors, and political entities (governments of China, Russia, the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U., to name a few) have coalesced and caused global natural gas prices to surge to record highs. This is...

Preemptive excuse-making isn’t a sign of great confidence — the winning side never complains of cheating. Sure enough, incumbent governor Gavin Newsom cruised to a victory made a little easier, as it happens, by Elder’s insistence that Republicans were robbed in 2020 and about to be robbed again. To his...

Only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold from the start of 2022 in the UK and EU, but experts said the regulation was shockingly weak. The report used data on the emissions produced by stoves in perfect laboratory conditions and the pollution could be even higher in everyday use, the researchers said, with older stoves being much worse. Tiny particle...
__label__3 Civil rights groups challenge new Texas voting legislationCivil rights groups on Friday filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to block Texas’ new voting legislation, saying it would violate the civil rights of minorities by making it more difficult for them to cast their ballots. “The Texas Legislature’s claims of voter fraud and voter integrity are merely pretexts for their actual purpose in enacting SB1, which is to make it harder for citizens of color and citizens with disabilities to cast their votes,” said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of...
__label__1 Taliban Seize Kandahar, Prepare to March on Afghan Capital KabulThe Taliban completed the seizure of Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the Islamist movement’s birthplace, and took into custody a warlord who organized the failed defenses of the western city of Herat. Combined with other advances, including the capture of the provincial capital of Helmand, the fall of these two major cities has given the Taliban full control of southern and western Afghanistan, allowing the insurgent movement to pool its forces for a final march on Kabul. The U.S. has already launched the drawdown of its large embassy in Kabul, sending troops...
__label__4 Google wants to show flyers their carbon emissions with flight options in sustainable travel pushThis Wednesday, Google launched a new feature that displays a carbon emissions estimate for nearly every flight in its search results next to the price and duration of the flight. It'll allow eco-conscious travelers to factor carbon emissions into their choice when deciding which flight to book. These emissions estimates are flight-specific as well as seat-specific. For instance, newer aircraft generally pollute less than older aircraft, and emissions increase for premium economy and first-class seats because they take up more space and account for a larger share of total emissions, according to Richard Holden, Google's vice president of...
__label__3 Texas Legislature Passes Election Integrity LegislationThe Republican-controlled Texas state House and Senate on Tuesday passed the final versions of the controversial voter integrity legislation, which the Democrats tried to oppose for months. The House voted to pass the bill 80-41 with only one Republican joining the Democrats, and the Senate passed the legislation hours later with an 18-13 party-line vote. After the bill’s passage — a major victory for the Republicans — the text will now go to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s (R) desk to be signed into law. Abbott, in trying to pass the bill, had called...

The clamor to flee the country is growing as borders are closed, choking the outflow of people and inflow of essential supplies. The insurgents have encircled the country and besieged the cities. They now control most border passes into the landlocked country. Billions of dollars in customs revenues are...
__label__5 We can’t just run away from wildfiresANALYSISIt has been yet another breathtaking year for disasters. While Hurricane Ida drenched a path from New Orleans to New York, leaving flooding and power outages in its wake, wildfires forced thousands to evacuate and sent choking smoke across the US. Such disasters are a fact of life in many parts of the country, and the risks are only growing as human activity continues to warm the planet. For those living in the West within reach of devastating blazes, that raises a difficult question: Should I stay or should I go?

Now, let’s talk about the mess in which we find our election system. Let’s talk about voter fraud. It does exist; claims to the contrary are incorrect. And discussions about voting integrity matter because we have about one year to decide how to avoid the confusion and controversy surrounding the 2020 election. “Flagrant” election fraud has been “documented throughout this nation’s history,” according to the U.S. Supreme Court. And so it goes today....
__label__2 U.S. expands Afghan refugee program as Taliban violence escalatesThe State Department announced Monday it is expanding grants of eligibility for refugee status in the U.S. for at-risk Afghans, citing an increase in violence by the Taliban ahead of the U.S. military's total withdrawal. Why it matters: The Biden administration has faced pressure to do more to help Afghans who assisted the U.S. military over the course of the two-decade war. The expansion will allow thousands more Afghans and their family members to apply for permanent refugee resettlement, according to the State Department. Details: The program covers Afghans who worked with the U.S. as locally-employed...

Limiting the damage caused by future disasters will require a whole-of-government approach — one not limited to what the federal government can do. There’s a host of ideas that states and municipalities could implement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in some of the world’s biggest polluters: American cities. According to a 2021 study published in Frontiers, Houston, Chicago, and Los Angeles have some of the highest...

The National Federation of Independent Business reported last week that a record 51% of small-business owners had openings in September that they could not fill, a 48-year high, even though the boost in unemployment benefits ended on Labor Day. The shortage indicates that other factors are at play. Among them are a rash of accelerated retirements, a soaring personal savings rate, ongoing coronavirus fears...

At a rally in Denver in 2017, he warned the crowd that Trump “might have something to hide.” That same year, on the floor of the House, he introduced a resolution to force the president to release the records, calling them an “important baseline disclosure.” But during Polis’ successful run for governor of Colorado in 2018, his calls for transparency faded.

But her refusal to raise tax rates on high earners and major corporations to pay for Mr. Biden’s plan is pushing Democrats toward wealth taxation and other measures once embraced only by the party’s left flank. The frenzied search for new paths around Ms. Sinema’s tax-rate blockade has cheered liberals but raised serious qualms among more moderate Democrats, who now openly say they hope that...

"To set SNAP families up for success, we need a Thrifty Food Plan that supports current dietary guidance on a budget," said Stacy Dean, deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition, and consumer services, in the detailed report. "Too many of our fellow Americans struggle to afford healthy meals. The revised plan is one step...

Short-term assistance becoming long-term 'trap,' report warnsExpanded federal unemployment benefits, put in place as an emergency measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, are on course to become another long-term "welfare trap," a government fiscal watchdog group warns in a new report.  Under emergency response legislation, the federal government expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits, extended the number of weeks, and gave bonuses to state unemployment benefits. The expansion will sunset in September, but congressional Democrats have pressed President Biden for an extension. The benefits have been extended before.  "It has started to look more like welfare and more like another piece of the welfare package. It’s...

But it's not Biden officials or Democrats who are pushing the topic most aggressively on Twitter and other platforms. It's Republicans and right-wing media outlets attacking the proposal as a violation of privacy and arguing that the IRS would...
__label__3 Critics Warned the Largest Tax Increase in San Francisco History Would Be Ill-Spent. It's Now Funding $60,000 Tents for the Homeless.ANALYSISWhen San Francisco voters were considering a 2018 ballot measure that would impose the largest tax increase in city history to fund homelessness services, critics warned that the initiative's spending plan was vague and unaccountable. Now, a chunk of that money is going to fund some very expensive tents. On Wednesday, staff for the city's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing went before the Board of Supervisors' Budget and Appropriations Committee to request $20 million over the next two fiscal years to continue operating six "safe sleeping" tent encampments.

__label__2 The New Domestic War on Terror Has Already Begun -- Even Without the New Laws Biden WantsOPINIONThe Department of Homeland Security on Friday issued a new warning bulletin, alerting Americans that domestic extremists may well use violence on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. This was at least the fourth such bulletin issued this year by Homeland Security (DHS) warning of the same danger and, thus far, none of the fears it is trying to instill into the American population has materialized. The first was a January 14 warning, from numerous federal agencies including DHS, about violence in Washington, DC and all fifty state capitols that was...
__label__4 Democrats likely to throw billions in tax hikes overboard as spending plans shrinkDemocrats will likely drop hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed tax increases on the rich as they scramble to shrink the size of their “reconciliation” package. That’s good news for moderates who are less enthusiastic about raising rates. But it’s potentially terrible news for progressives hoping to stick it to the rich. Many see this as their best chance in years to push through major changes in how wealthy people are taxed — such as a proposal to begin taxing, for the first time, billionaires’ unrealized capital gains.

However, as tax revenue from gasoline purchases continues to fall, the plan does call for the establishment of a voluntary pilot program to study the potential impacts of a driving tax.

__label__4 More Than Half of America’s 100 Richest People Exploit Special Trusts to Avoid Estate TaxesIt’s well known, at least among tax lawyers and accountants for the ultrawealthy: The estate tax can be easily avoided by exploiting a loophole unwittingly created by Congress three decades ago. By using special trusts, a rarefied group of Americans has taken advantage of this loophole, reducing government revenues and fueling inequality. There is no way for the public to know who uses these special trusts aside from when they’ve been disclosed in lawsuits or securities filings. There’s also been no way to quantify just how much in estate tax...

__label__3 Psaki charges sexism and racism are part of what's driving criticism of Kamala HarrisWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said she feels that sexism and racism have contributed to the intensity of criticism faced by Vice President Kamala Harris."I do think that it has been easier and harsher from some in the right wing who have gone after her because she is the first woman, the first woman of color. I’m not suggesting anyone will acknowledge that publicly," Psaki said during an appearance on Politico's "Women Rule" podcast Wednesday.
__label__2 Major automakers fear the global chip shortage could persist for some timeCar manufacturers including Ford, Volkswagen and Daimler are still struggling to deal with the impact of the global chip shortage, with executives from each of the companies warning a lack of silicon is likely to remain a problem. Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius and Ford Europe chairman of the management board Gunnar Herrmann told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach at the Munich Motor Show on Monday that it’s hard to tell when the complex issue will be resolved.

__label__1 Dawn of the electric vehicle age? One car shopper’s experience.Seated for the first time in an electric car – a Ford Mustang Mach-E so new it doesn’t have a sticker price yet – Mary Beermann has a broad grin on her face. She struggles to open the doors, the trunk, and even the cover to the connector plug – a boomer flailing in the push-button dawn of the electric-car age. But none of this seems to daunt her. “I think this is it,” she says. “This is my next car.” It’s partly my doing, really. A few weeks earlier,...
__label__4 You Are the Object of a Secret Extraction OperationOPINIONFacebook is not just any corporation. It reached trillion-dollar status in a single decade by applying the logic of what I call surveillance capitalism — an economic system built on the secret extraction and manipulation of human data — to its vision of connecting the entire world. Facebook and other leading surveillance capitalist corporations now control information flows and communication infrastructures across the world. These infrastructures are critical to the possibility of a democratic society, yet our democracies have allowed these companies to own, operate and mediate our information spaces unconstrained by...

__label__1 The Postal Service Presses Forward With Unpopular Plan To Slow Some Mail DeliveryTwo of the newly confirmed members of the U.S. Postal Service's Board of Governors spoke out Friday against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's plan to slow delivery of first-class mail. But the board took no steps to stop or even modify the 10-year plan despite the concerns expressed by the board members and regulators. Ronald Stroman, one of three new governors named by President Biden, said that intentionally slowing first-class mail and package delivery by changing service standards is "strategically ill-conceived, creates dangerous risks that are not justified by the relatively...
__label__4 Why Facebook won’t let you control your own news feedANALYSISIn at least two experiments over the years, Facebook has explored what happens when it turns off its controversial news feed ranking system — the software that decides for each user which posts they’ll see and in what order, internal documents show. That leaves users to see all the posts from all of their friends in simple, chronological order. Both tests appear to have taught Facebook’s researchers the same lesson: Users are better off with Facebook’s software calling the shots. The internal research documents, some previously unreported, help to explain...
__label__3 ‘Our Identity Has Been Hijacked’ANALYSISWhen the Taliban first imposed its vision for Afghanistan’s cultural and political landscape between 1996 and 2001, the country’s women were subjected to wide-ranging forms of gender-based hardships. In addition to policies—like mandatory burqas, education bans, and forced isolation— designed to expel 50 percent of the population from the public eye and positions of power, Afghan women suffered rampant sexual assault, the very thing the former decrees ostensibly protected against.  With the fall of Kabul and the Taliban’s formation of an all-male “interim” government, the jihadist group’s treatment of women...

Reports have circulated in recent months that Apple is building its own electric self-driving car, which the company has been tight-lipped about. According to CNBC, the project is dubbed Titan and is being run by Doug Field, who returned to Apple in 2018 after working at Tesla for five years.

The national average of $3.12 per gallon Thursday is nearly a dollar more than prices were a year ago at this time, according to AAA. Analysts say the price could jump another 20 cents or more per gallon this summer. It is unusual for gasoline prices to continue rising into the summer, and the last time that happened was in 2008...

A tale from a Boston suburb shows why America has fallen behind other nations – and what it needs to fix. From the bridge over the railroad, William White can trace the contours of the crowded city streets where he grew up, not far from the slaughterhouses and factories that abutted the tracks below.

__label__5 Eight Things We Learned From The Facebook PapersFor months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted...

So, what’s the solution to decreasing this gender gap worldwide? There’s considerable evidence that the best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The World Bank Group’s Women, Business and the Law 2021 annual report outlines the importance of gender equality for women’s...
__label__1 Bipartisan infrastructure deal omits major climate change measuresWhite House negotiators and a group of senators struck a deal on a bipartisan infrastructure agreement on Thursday that slashes measures to combat climate change and help the U.S. transition to a clean energy economy. The narrow infrastructure deal leaves President Joe Biden’s proposals on climate change to a separate bill that Democrats could attempt to pass through Congress using reconciliation, a process that doesn’t require Republican support. The second package could also include programs related to child and elder care, education, and health care, in addition to climate change measures, issues that administration officials...

Haugen, a former Facebook employee who released tens of thousands of damaging documents about its inner workings, travelled to London from the US for a parliamentary hearing and gave qualified backing to UK government proposals to regulate social media platforms and make them take some responsibility for content...
__label__3 Drafting Our DaughtersOPINIONLast week, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a provision, to be included in the National Defense Authorization Act, that would require women to register with Selective Service, that is, the military draft. This is a grave mistake, but not a surprising one. Requiring women to register with the Selective Service has long been avoided by lawmakers, even as they have gradually eliminated exclusions aimed at shielding women from exposure to direct combat, in part due to its abiding unpopularity. In 2016, however, the last of these restrictions was removed, opening combat arms...

The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under...

Most, it seems, will be traveling by road. That’s a nearly 40% jump from last year when 34 million Americans visited family on the federal holiday during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, many against the advice of health professionals, according to data from AAA. Still, the expected number of travelers is trailing below 2019 when some 49 million Americans, a record-high, traveled over the holiday. The resurgence in travel comes as more than...
__label__4 Revealed; Facebook's Secret Blacklist of "Dangerous Individuals and Organizations"TO WARD OFF accusations that it helps terrorists spread propaganda, Facebook has for many years barred users from speaking freely about people and groups it says promote violence. The restrictions appear to trace back to 2012, when in the face of growing alarm in Congress and the United Nations about online terrorist recruiting, Facebook added to its Community Standards a ban on “organizations with a record of terrorist or violent criminal activity.” This modest rule has since ballooned into what’s known as the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, a sweeping set of restrictions on what Facebook’s nearly...
__label__3 Young Women Lose under Biden’s Title IX EdictANALYSISPresident Joe Biden’s Department of Education has issued guidance declaring that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination — or so-called discrimination — on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The new guidance mirrors the stance taken by Barack Obama’s administration during the final year of his presidency, when the Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter tacking on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to the definition of sex discrimination as outlined in Title IX. Wielding this radical redefinition of terms, the Obama administration proceeded to mandate that federally...
__label__2 Behind stalled bill: Infrastructure is about visions for AmericaPresident Biden’s struggles to find agreement in Congress to overhaul U.S. infrastructure aren’t just about dollar totals. They’re also about values: What kind of 21st century should we build? United States Route 275 has all the signs of a split personality. Running east out of Norfolk, Nebraska, it’s a four-lane divided highway for 12 miles until, inexplicably, it narrows to a two-lane road and makes a long lazy bend southward to Scribner, where it becomes a four-lane again all the way to Omaha. That 45-mile stretch of unimproved country lane...

The brain drain has seen more than a dozen senior Democratic tech and telecom policy staffers leaving their posts this year, according to a POLITICO review of recent exits, with many taking lobbying roles at powerhouses including Facebook, Verizon, Apple, Charter Communications, the National Association of Broadcasters and the cloud company VMware. They’re leaving members’ personal offices as well as the Senate...
__label__3 Biden Budget Proposal Refers To Mothers As ‘Birthing People’President Joe Biden’s $6 trillion budget proposal demands $200 million for maternal health care — but refers to mothers as “birthing people,” adopting progressive parlance designed to ignore gender-based distinctions. The provision appears in the budget draft’s healthcare spending designations, in a line item that allocates “$200 million to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates nationwide; bolster Maternal Mortality Review Committees; help cities place early childhood development experts in pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) patients; implement implicit bias training for healthcare...
__label__1 Top 1% dodge $163 billion in annual taxes, Treasury estimatesThe top 1% of Americans may be dodging as much as $163 billion in annual taxes, according to a report from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  This estimate widens the so-called tax gap — the shortfall between how much is owed and collected — to $600 billion every year, the report outlines. The Treasury doesn’t define income levels on its analysis of the top 1%, but says the lost revenue is equal to all the levies paid by the lowest-earning 90% of taxpayers.  “I think it’s a timely report because it’s...

__label__3 Why the Supreme Court should deliver a death blow to Roe v. WadeOPINIONThis week, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Mississippi’s 2018 Gestational Age Act. This law bans abortion after 15 weeks into a pregnancy. A central question in the case will be “viability”: whether a fetus can survive outside the womb at 15 weeks. This case provides an opportunity for the Supreme Court to deliver a much-deserved death blow to Roe v. Wade. In 1973, Roe opened the door for abortion on demand and the tragic deaths of more than 63 million unborn children. For decades, conservatives and anti-abortion voters...
__label__2 Treasury Dept to invoke ‘extraordinary measures’ as Congress misses debt-ceiling deadlineThe Treasury Department will begin conducting emergency cash-conservation steps on Monday to avoid busting the federal borrowing limit after a two-year suspension of the debt ceiling expired at the end of July. Economists say those so-called extraordinary measures will allow Treasury to pay off the government’s bills without floating new debt for two to three months. After that, Congress will need to either raise or suspend the borrowing limit or risk the U.S. defaulting on its obligations. The limit, a facet of American politics for over a century, prevents the...

"Imagine planting your own whistleblower to expose yourself for not censoring enough so you can censor more," the image said in a text caption, which was overlaid on top of a photo from Haugen’s Oct. 3 interview with CBS News’ "60 Minutes."

__label__2 U.S. proposes global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, with an eye on something even higherCorporations around the world should pay at least a 15% tax on their earnings, the Treasury Department said Thursday as part of its push for a global minimum for businesses. The final rate could go even higher than that, according to a Treasury release that said the 15% minimum is a “floor and that discussions should continue to be ambitious and push that rate higher.” U.S-based companies currently pay a 21% rate, a level that was slashed during the Trump administration. Previously, the top rate had been 35%. Under a proposal...

In a 1,300-word statement, Zuckerberg defended Facebook's services and, appealing to its employees, suggested that both their work and the company as a whole were being misrepresented. Here's a look at what Zuckerberg claimed and what we know. In response to claims from Haugen and an investigation by the Wall Street Journal that Instagram, which is owned by...
__label__3 ‘Not Refugees’: Polish Government Fact-Checks CNN on Belarus-Engineered Migrant CrisisANALYSISPoland’s national-conservative government has fact-checked CNN on the migrant crisis engineered on the European Union’s eastern border by Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman for the Minister-Coordinator of Special Services at National Security Department of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, admonished CNN after it published an article on the ongoing border crisis, which has seen mostly Middle Eastern and South Asian migrants clashing with Polish border guards, police officers, and soldiers manning the frontier. The American news outlet, Żaryn alleged, had “missed the point” by characterising the situation as one in which...

The second-quarter estimate assumes an end-June cash balance of $800 billion, the Treasury said in a statement. It comes after the Treasury in February slashed its borrowing projections for the first and second quarters as part of a plan to reduce its cash balance. The Treasury said it issued $401 billion in net debt in the first quarter,...

__label__3 China And The ‘G’ Word—GenocideOPINIONThough it acts as a court, it has no official status. The governments asked to participate have either snubbed or (in the case of China) condemned it. Some witnesses, under threat of sanctions from Beijing, started dropping out before its proceedings had even begun. And yet, the Uyghur Tribunal, whose final hearings took place in London in September, is an institution nobody can afford to ignore. It offers the best hope yet of answering a pressing question: is China committing genocide against the Uyghurs, the 12 million Turkic Muslims in...

The hackers reportedly broke into the email systems at those two government departments, but the full extent of the breach was not immediately clear as U.S. officials scrambled to make an assessment. There are concerns that hackers may have penetrated other government departments and perhaps many private companies as...
__label__5 Is This Facebook’s ‘Big Tobacco’ Moment?ANALYSISFacebook Inc. executives have long boasted that its platforms are safe, even as they invested in ways to keep teenagers hooked and hid what they knew about the side effects. Sound familiar? Critics say Big Tobacco once used the same playbook, and it’s fueling a whole new level of outrage against the social media giant. Facebook consistently played down its own research that showed how photo-sharing app Instagram can harm the mental well-being of its youngest users, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Almost a third of young teen girls told...

__label__5 How one anti-mask activist leveraged TikTok and Facebook to spur local school protests across the countryOPINIONA conservative activist was able to leverage TikTok and Facebook in less than five months to spark nationwide school protests against masks and vaccines, prompting some school districts to respond.  After a TikTok video encouraging conservative protests around the country went viral in April, the account owner created Freedom515, an organization that now has a network of 51 private Facebook groups and over 30,000 members. In the months that followed, the user leveraged both platforms to organize numerous right-wing protests for people fed up with “the direction of things,” including...

It gives the chief secretary – the second-most powerful figure in the city’s administration – the power to revoke a film’s licence if it is found to “endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security”.  Reuters reported, “[p]unishment for violating the law included up...
__label__2 Why Is The Census Bureau Still Asking A Citizenship Question On Forms?You won't see a citizenship question on the 2020 census. After a more than year-long legal fight, three federal judges are making sure of that by permanently blocking the Trump administration from using next year's head count to ask about the U.S. citizenship status of every person living in every household in the country. But the Census Bureau, which conducts more than 100 surveys for the federal government, is continuing to ask about citizenship on other forms, which have sparked plenty of confusion around the country. Unlike the census, these...
