To say that abortion bans, like those recently passed in Texas, are part of a war on women is true. But to say they are a war on women alone is to erase the harm experienced by the transgender, intersex, nonbinary and gender expansive individuals whose lives are also deeply impacted by access to abortion and reproductive healthcare.

It was hard to avoid misinformation online in 2020. A pandemic and a polarized presidential election had the internet swirling with everything from false cures for Covid-19 to misleading claims of election fraud. But another reason you kept encountering misinformation is that people have been talking about it a lot more than they were last year.

American women are having fewer children and having them later than ever before — a demographic shift being met with significant consternation from the left and right alike.
For conservatives, the fact that more women are putting off parenthood or forgoing it entirely is evidence of a dangerous decline in traditional family values. In this framing, women have been manipulated into putting their educational and professional aspirations ahead of motherhood, contributing to a broader cultural breakdown.",New York Times (Opinion),Left,/Users/greysonnewton/Desktop/txt-spch/youtube/youtube_ai/nlp/data/allsides_training_data/images/Women's Issues1itemnum12.jpg

The Supreme Court captured its biggest headlines last month not for a decision, but for a case it agreed to review next year: Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The case turns on a 2018 Mississippi law banning abortion at 15 weeks, but its impact will likely reach well beyond one state. To uphold Mississippi’s law—which the Court’s conservative majority is expected to do—the Court will have to undo all or part of Roe v.
